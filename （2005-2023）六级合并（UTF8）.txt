Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Throughout the nation’s more than 15,000 school districts, widely differing approaches to teaching science and math have emerged. Though there can be strength in diversity, a new international analysis suggests that this variability has instead contributed to lackluster (平淡的) achievement scores by U.S. children relative to their peers in other developed countries.
Indeed, concludes William H. Schmidt of Michigan State University, who led the new analysis, “no single intellectually coherent vision dominates U.S. educational practice in math or science.” The reason, he said, “is because the system is deeply and fundamentally flawed.”
The new analysis, released this week by the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va., is based on data collected from about 50 nations as part of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study.
Not only do approaches to teaching science and math vary among individual U.S. communities, the report finds, but there appears to be little strategic focus within a school district’s curricula, its textbooks, or its teachers’ activities. This contrasts sharply with the coordinated national programs of most other countries.
On average, U.S. students study more topics within science and math than their international counterparts do. This creates an educational environment that “is a mile wide and an inch deep,” Schmidt notes.
For instance, eighth graders in the United States cover about 33 topics in math versus just 19 in Japan. Among science courses, the international gap is even wider. U.S. curricula for this age level resemble those of a small group of countries including Australia, Thailand, Iceland, and Bulgaria. Schmidt asks whether the United States wants to be classed with these nations, whose educational systems “share our pattern of splintered (支离破碎的) visions” but which are not economic leaders.
The new report “couldn’t come at a better time,” says Gerald Wheeler, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association in Arlington. “The new National Science Education Standards provide that focused vision,” including the call “to do less, but in greater depth.”
Implementing the new science standards and their math counterparts will be the challenge, he and Schmidt agree, because the decentralized responsibility for education in the United States requires that any reforms be tailored and instituted one community at a time.
In fact, Schmidt argues, reforms such as these proposed national standards “face an almost impossible task, because even though they are intellectually coherent, each becomes only one more voice in the babble (嘈杂声).”

A) scratches the surface of a wide range of topics
B) lays stress on quality at the expense of quantity
C) encourages learning both in depth and in scope
D) offers an environment for comprehensive education

Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
I had an experience some years ago which taught me something about the ways in which people make a bad situation worse by blaming themselves. One January, I had to officiate at two funerals on successive days for two elderly women in my community. Both had died “full of years,” as the Bible would say; both yielded to the normal wearing out of the body after a long and full life. Their homes happened to be near each other, so I paid condolence (吊唁) calls on the two families on the same afternoon.
At the first home, the son of the deceased (已故的) woman said to me, “If only I had sent my mother to Florida and gotten her out of this cold and snow, she would be alive today. It’s my fault that she died.” At the second home, the son of the other deceased woman said, “If only I hadn’t insisted on my mother’s going to Florida, she would be alive today. That long airplane ride, the abrupt change of climate, was more than she could take. It’s my fault that she’s dead.”
When things don’t turn out as we would like them to, it is very tempting to assume that had we done things differently, the story would have had a happier ending. Priests know that any time there is a death, the survivors will feel guilty. Because the course of action they took turned out badly, they believe that the opposite course-keeping Mother at home, postponing the operation—would have turned out better. After all, how could it have turned out any worse?
There seem to be two elements involved in our readiness to feel guilt. The first is our pressing need to believe that the world makes sense, that there is a cause for every effect and a reason for everything that happens. That leads us to find patterns and connections both where they really exist and where they exist only in our minds.
The second element is the notion that we are the cause of what happens, especially the bad things that happen. It seems to be a short step from believing that every event has a cause to believing that every disaster is our fault. The roots of this feeling may lie in our childhood. Psychologists speak of the infantile myth of omnipotence (万能). A baby comes to think that the world exists to meet his needs, and that he makes everything happen in it. He wakes up in the morning and summons the rest of the world to its tasks. He cries, and someone comes to attend to him. When he is hungry, people feed him, and when he is wet, people change him. Very often, we do not completely outgrow that infantile notion that our wishes cause things to happen.
26.	What is said about the two deceased elderly women?
A) They lived out a natural life.
B) They died due to lack of care by family members.
C) They died of exhaustion after the long plane ride.
D) They weren’t accustomed to the change in weather.
27.	The author had to conduct the two women’s funerals probably because ________.
A) he had great sympathy for the deceased
B) he wanted to console the two families
C) he was priest of the local church
D) he was an official from the community
28.	People feel guilty for the deaths of their loved ones because ________.
A) they believe that they were responsible
B) they had neglected the natural course of events
C) they couldn’t find a better way to express their grief
D) they didn’t know things often turn out in the opposite direction
29.	In the context of the passage, “... the world makes sense” (Line 2, Para, 4) probably means that ________.
A) we have to be sensible in order to understand the world
B) everything in the world is predetermined
C) there’s an explanation for everything in the world
D) the world can be interpreted in different ways
30.	People have been made to believe since infancy that ________.
A) every story should have a happy ending
B) their wishes are the cause of everything that happens
C) life and death is an unsolved mystery
D) everybody is at their command
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
“I’ve never met a human worth cloning,” says cloning expert Mark Westhusin from his lab at Texas A&M University. “It’s a stupid endeavor.” That’s an interesting choice of adjective, coming from a man who has spent millions of dollars trying to clone a 13-year-old dog named Missy. So far, he and his team have not succeeded, though they have cloned two cows and expect to clone a cat soon. They just might succeed in cloning Missy this spring—or perhaps not for another 5 years. It seems the reproductive system of man’s best friend is one of the mysteries of modern science.
Westhusin’s experience with cloning animals leaves him upset by all this talk of human cloning. In three years of work on the Missy project, using hundreds upon hundreds of dog’s eggs, the A&M team has produced only a dozen or so embryos (胚胎) carrying Missy’s DNA. None have survived the transfer to a surrogate (代孕的) mother. The wastage of eggs and the many spontaneously aborted fetuses (胎) may be acceptable when you’re dealing with cats or bulls, he argues, but not with humans. “Cloning is incredibly inefficient, and also dangerous,” he says.
Even so, dog cloning is a commercial opportunity, with a nice research payoff. Ever since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1997, Westhusin’s phone has been ringing with people calling in hopes of duplicating their cats and dogs, cattle and horses. “A lot of people want to clone pets, especially if the price is right,” says Westhusin. Cost is no obstacle for Missy’s mysterious billionaire owner; he’s put up $3.7 million so far to fund A&M’s research.
Contrary to some media reports, Missy is not dead. The owner wants a twin to carry on Missy’s fine qualities after she does die. The prototype is, by all accounts, athletic, good-natured and supersmart. Missy’s master does not expect an exact copy of her. He knows her clone may not have her temperament. In a statement of purpose, Missy’s owner and the A&M team say they are “both looking forward to studying the ways that her clones differ from Missy.”
Besides cloning a great dog, the project may contribute insight into the old question of nature vs, nurture. It could also lead to the cloning of special rescue dogs and many endangered animals.
However, Westhusin is cautious about his work. He knows that even if he gets a dog pregnant, the offspring, should they survive, will face the problems shown at birth by other cloned animals: abnormalities like immature lungs and heart and weight problems~ “Why would you ever want to clone humans,Westhusin asks, “when we’re not even close to getting it worked out in animals yet?”
31.	By “stupid endeavor” (Line 2, Para. 1), Westhusin means to say that ________.
A) human cloning is a foolish undertaking
B) animal cloning is absolutely impractical
C) human cloning should be done selectively
D) animal cloning is not worth the effort at all
32.	What does the first paragraph tell us about Westhusin’s dog cloning project?
A) Its success is already in sight.
B) It is doomed to utter failure.
C) It is progressing smoothly.
D) Its outcome remains uncertain.
33.	By cloning Missy, Mark Westhusin hopes to ________.
A) examine the reproductive system of the dog species
B) find out the differences between Missy and its clones
C) search for ways to modify.its temperament
D) study the possibility of cloning humans
34.	We learn from the passage that animal clones are likely to have ________.
A) an abnormal shape
B) a bad temper
C) defective organs
D) immune deficiency
35.	It can be seen that present cloning techniques ________.
A) provide insight into the question of nature vs, nurture
B) have been widely used in saving endangered species
C) have proved quite adequate for the cloning of humans
D) still have a long way to go before reaching maturity
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Frustrated with delays in Sacramento, Bay Area officials said Thursday they planned to take matters into their own hands to regulate the region’s growing pile of electronic trash.
A San Jose councilwoman and a San Francisco supervisor said they would propose local initiatives aimed at controlling electronic waste if the California law-making body fails to act on two bills stalled in the Assembly. They are among a growing number of California cities and counties that have expressed the same intention.
Environmentalists and local governments are increasingly concerned about the toxic hazard posed by old electronic devices and the cost of safely recycling those products. An estimated 6 million televisions and computers are stocked in California homes, and an additional 6,000 to 7,000 computers become outdated every day. The machines contain high levels of lead and other hazardous substances, and are already banned from California landfills (垃圾填埋场).
Legislation by Senator Byron Sher would require consumers to pay a recycling fee of up to $30 on every new machine containing a cathode (阴极) ray tube. Used in almost all video monitors and televisions, those devices contain four to eight pounds of lead each. The fees would go toward setting up recycling programs, providing grants to non-profit agencies that reuse the tubes and rewarding manufacturers that encourage recycling.
A separate bill by Los Angeles-area Senator Gloria Romero would require high-tech manufacturers to develop programs to recycle so-called e-waste.
If passed, the measures would put California at the forefront of national efforts to manage the refuse of the electronic age.
But high-tech groups, including the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and the American Electronics Association, oppose the measures, arguing that fees of up to $30 will drive consumers to online, out-of-state retailers.
“What really needs to occur is consumer education. Most consumers are unaware they’re not supposed to throw computers in the trash,” said Roxanne Gould, vice president of government relations for the electronics association.
Computer recycling should be a local effort and part of residential waste collection programs, she added.
Recycling electronic waste is a dangerous and specialized matter, and environmentalists maintain the state must support recycling efforts and ensure that the job isn’t contracted to unscrupulous (毫无顾忌的) junk dealers who send the toxic parts overseas.
“The graveyard of the high-tech revolution is ending up in rural China,” said Ted Smith, director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. His group is pushing for an amendment to Sher’s bill that would prevent the export of e-waste.
36.	What step were Bay Area officials going to take regarding e-waste disposal?
A) Rally support to pass the stalled bills.
B) Lobby the lawmakers of the California Assembly.
C) Lay down relevant local regulations themselves.
D) Exert pressure on manufacturers of electronic devices.
37.	The two bills stalled in the California Assembly both concern ________.
A) the reprocessing of the huge amounts of electronic waste in the state
B) regulations on dumping hazardous substances into landfills
C) the funding of local initiatives to reuse electronic trash
D) the sale of used electronic devices to foreign countries
38.	Consumers are not supposed to throw used computers in the trash because ________.
A) this is banned by the California government
B) some parts may be recycled for use elsewhere
C) unscrupulous dealers will retrieve them for profit
D) they contain large amounts of harmful substances
39.	High-tech groups believe that if an extra $30 is charged on every TV or computer purchased in California, consumers will ________.
A) hesitate to upgrade their computers
B) abandon online shopping
C) buy them from other states
D) strongly protest against such a charge
40.	We learn from the passage that much of California’s electronic waste has been ________.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says its ten-year campaign to remove leprosy (麻风病) as a world health problem has been successful. Doctor Brundtland, head of the WHO, says a number of leprosy cases around the world has (S1) been cut of ninety percent during the past ten years. She says (S2) efforts are continuing to complete end the disease. (S3)
Leprosy is caused by bacteria spread through liquid from the nose and mouth. The disease mainly effects the skin and (S4) nerves. However, if leprosy is not treated it can cause permanent damage for the skin, nerves, eyes, arms or legs. (S5)
In 1999, an international campaign began to end leprosy. The WHO, governments of countries most affected by the disease, and several other groups are part of the campaign. This alliance guarantees that all leprosy patients, even they (S6) are poor, have a right to the most modern treatment.
Doctor Brundtland says leprosy is no longer a disease that requires life-long treatments by medical experts. Instead, patients can take that is called a multi-drug therapy. This (S7) modern treatment will cure leprosy in 6 to 12 months, depend on the form of the disease. The treatment combines (S8) several drugs taken daily or once a month. The WHO has given multi-drug therapy to patients freely for the last five (S9) years. The members of the alliance against leprosy plan to target the countries which still threatened by leprosy. Among (S10) the estimated 600,000 victims around the world, the WHO believes about 70% are in India. The disease also remains a problem in Africa and South America.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.
Passage One
Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage.
Low-level slash-and-burn farming doesn’t harm rainforest. On the contrary, it helps farmers and improves forest soils. This is the unorthodox view of a German soil scientist who has shown that burnt clearings in the Amazon, dating back more than 1,000 years, helped create patches of rich, fertile soil that farmers still benefit from today.
Most rainforest soils are thin and poor because they lack minerals and because the heat and heavy rainfall destroy most organic matter in the soils within four years of it reaching the forest floor. This means topsoil contains few of the ingredients needed for long-term successful farming.
But Bruno Glaser, a soil scientist of the University of Bayreuth, has studied unexpected patches of fertile soils in the central Amazon. These soils contain lots of organic matter.
Glaser has shown that most of this fertile organic matter comes from “black carbon”—the organic particles from camp fires and charred (烧成炭的) wood left over from thousands of years of slash-and-burn farming. “The soils, known as Terra Preta, contained up to 70times more black carbon than the surrounding soil, “says Glaser.
Unburnt vegetation rots quickly, but black carbon persists in the soil for many centuries. Radiocarbon dating shows that the charred wood in Terra Preta soils is typically more than 1,000 years old.
“Slash-and-burn farming can be good for soils provided it doesn’t completely burn all the vegetation, and leaves behind charred wood,” says Glaser. “It can be better than manure (粪肥).” Burning the forest just once can leave behind enough black carbon to keep the soil fertile for thousands of years. And rainforests easily regrow after small-scale clearing. Contrary to the conventional view that human activities damage the environment, Glaser says: “Black carbon combined with human wastes is responsible for the richness of Terra Preta soils.”
Terra Preta soils turn up in large patches all over the Amazon, where they are highly prized by farmers. All the patches fall within 500 square kilometers in the central Amazon. Glaser says the widespread presence of pottery (陶器) confirms the soil’s human origins.
The findings add weight to the theory that large areas of the Amazon have recovered so well from past periods of agricultural use that the regrowth has been mistaken by generations of biologists for “virgin” forest.
During the past decade, researchers have discovered hundreds of large earth works deep in the jungle. They are up to 20 meters high and cover up to a square kilometer. Glaser claims that these earth works, built between AD 400 and 1400, were at the heart of urban civilizations. Now it seems the richness of the Terra Preta soils may explain how such civilizations managed to feed themselves.
11.	We learn from the passage that the traditional view of slash-and-burn farming is that ________.
A) it does no harm to the topsoil of the rainforest
B) it destroys rainforest soils
C) it helps improve rainforest soils
D) it diminishes the organic matter in rainforest soils
12.	Most rainforest soils are thin and poor because ________.
A) the composition of the topsoil is rather unstable
B) black carbon is washed away by heavy rains
C) organic matter is quickly lost due to heat and rain
D) long-term farming has exhausted the ingredients essential to plant growth
13.	Glaser made his discovery by ________.
A) studying patches of fertile soils in the central Amazon
B) examining pottery left over by ancient civilizations
C) test-burning patches of trees in the central Amazon

A) They take centuries to regrow after being burnt.
B) They cannot recover unless the vegetation is burnt completely.
C) Their regrowth will be hampered by human habitation.
D) They can recover easily after slash-and-burn farming.
15.	From the passage it can be inferred that ________.
A) human activities will do grave damage to rainforests
B) Amazon rainforest soils used to be the richest in the world
C) farming is responsible for the destruction of the Amazon rainforests
D) there once existed an urban civilization in the Amazon rainforests
Passage Two
Questions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage.
As a wise man once said, we are all ultimately alone. But an increasing number of Europeans are choosing to be so at an ever earlier age. This isn’t the stuff of gloomy philosophical contemplations, but a fact of Europe’s new economic landscape, embraced by sociologists, real-estate developers and ad executives alike. The shift away from family life to solo lifestyle, observes a French sociologist, is part of the “irresistible momentum of individualism” over the last century. The communications revolution, the shift from a business culture of stability to one of mobility and the mass entry of women into the workforce have greatly wreaked havoc on (扰乱) Europeans’ private lives.
Europe’s new economic climate has largely fostered the trend toward independence. The current generation of home-aloners came of age during Europe’s shift from social democracy to the sharper, more individualistic climate of American style capitalism. Raised in an era of privatization and increased consumer choice, today’s tech-savvy (精通技术的) workers have embraced a free market in love as well as economics. Modern Europeans are rich enough to afford to live alone, and temperamentally independent enough to want to do so.
Once upon a time, people who lived alone tended to be those on either side of marriage-twenty something professionals or widowed senior citizens. While pensioners, particularly elderly women, make up a large proportion of those living alone, the newest crop of singles are high earners in their 30s and 40s who increasingly view living alone as a lifestyle choice. Living alone was conceived to be negative-dark and cold, while being together suggested warmth and light. But then came along the idea of singles. They were young, beautiful, strong! Now, young people want to live alone.
The booming economy means people are working harder than ever. And that doesn’t leave much room for relationships. Pimpi Arroyo, a 35-year-old composer who lives alone in a house in Paris, says he hasn’t got time to get lonely because he has too much work. “I have deadlines which would make life with someone else fairly difficult.” Only an Ideal Woman would make him change his lifestyle, he says. Kaufmann, author of a recent book called “The Single Woman and Prince Charming,” thinks this fierce new individualism means that people expect more and more of mates, so relationships don’t last long-if they start at all. Eppendorf, a blond Berliner with a deep tan, teaches grade school in the mornings. In the afternoon she sunbathes or sleeps, resting up for going dancing. Just shy of 50, she says she’d never have wanted to do what her mother did-give up a career to raise a family. Instead, “I’ve always done what I wanted to do: live a self-determined life.”
16.	More and more young Europeans remain single because ________.
A) they are driven by an overwhelming sense of individualism
B) they have entered the workforce at a much earlier age
C) they have embraced a business culture of stability
D) they are pessimistic about their economic future
17.	What is said about European society in the passage?
A) It has fostered the trend towards small families.
B) It is getting closer to American-style capitalism.
C) It has limited consumer choice despite a free market.
D) It is being threatened by irresistible privatization.
18.	According to Paragraph 3, the newest group of singles are ________.
A) warm and lighthearted
B) on either side of marriage
C) negative and gloomy
D) healthy and wealthy
19.	The author quotes Eppendorf to show that ________.
A) some modern women prefer a life of individual freedom
B) the family is no longer the basic unit of society in present-day Europe
C) some professional people have too much work to do to feel lonely
D) most Europeans conceive living a single life as unacceptable
20.	What is the author’s purpose in writing the passage?
A) To review the impact of women becoming high earners.
B) To contemplate the philosophy underlying individualism.
C) To examine the trend of young people living alone.
D) To stress the rebuilding of personal relationships.
Passage Three
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Supporters of the biotech industry have accused an American scientist of misconduct after she testified to the New Zealand government that a genetically modified (GM) bacterium could cause serious damage if released.
The New Zealand Life Sciences Network, an association of pro-GM scientists and organisations, says the view expressed by Elaine Ingham, a soil biologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, was exaggerated and irresponsible. It has asked her university to discipline her.
But Ingham stands by her comments and says the complaints are an attempt to silence her. “They’re trying to cause trouble with my university and get me fired,” Ingham told New Scientist.
The controversy began on 1 February, when Ingham testified before New Zealand’s Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, which will determine how to regulate GM organisms. Ingham claimed that a GM version of a common soil bacterium could spread and destroy plants if released into the wild. Other researchers had previously modified the bacterium to produce alcohol from organic waste. But Ingham says that when she put it in soil with wheat plants, all of the plants died within a week.
“We would lose terrestrial (陆生的) plants... this is an organism that is potentially deadly to the continued survival of human beings,” she told the commission. She added that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) canceled its approval for field tests using the organism once she had told them about her research in 1999.
But last week the New Zealand Life Sciences Network accused Ingham of “presenting inaccurate, careless and exaggerated information” and “generating speculative doomsday scenarios (世界末日的局面) that are not scientifically supportable”. They say that her study doesn’t even show that the bacteria would survive in the wild, much less kill massive numbers of plants. What’s more, the network says that contrary to Ingham’s claims, the EPA was never asked to consider the organism for field trials.
The EPA has not commented on the dispute. But an e-mail to the network from Janet Anderson, director of the EPA’s bio-pesticides (生物杀虫剂) division, says “there is no record of a review and/or clearance to field test” the organism.
Ingham says EPA officials had told her that the organism was approved for field tests, but says she has few details. It’s also not clear whether the organism, first engineered by a German institute for biotechnology, is still in use.
Whether Ingham is right or wrong, her supporters say opponents are trying unfairly to silence her.
“I think her concerns should be taken seriously. She shouldn’t be harassed in this way,” says Ann Clarke, a plant biologist at the University of Guelph in Canada who also testified before the commission. “It’s an attempt to silence the opposition.”
21.	The passage centers on the controversy ________.
A) between American and New Zealand biologists over genetic modification
B) as to whether the study of genetic modification should be continued
C) over the possible adverse effect of a GM bacterium on plants
D) about whether Elaine Ingham should be fired by her university
22.	Ingham insists that her testimony is based on ________.
A) evidence provided by the EPA of the United States
B) the results of an experiment she conducted herself
C) evidence from her collaborative research with German biologists
D) the results of extensive field tests in Corvallis, Oregon
23.	According to Janet Anderson, the EPA ________.
A) has cancelled its approval for field tests of the GM organism
B) hasn’t reviewed the findings of Ingham’s research
C) has approved field tests using the GM organism
D) hasn’t given permission to field test the GM organism
24.	According to Ann Clarke, the New Zealand Life Sciences Network ________.
A) should gather evidence to discredit Ingham’s claims
B) should require that the research by their biologists be regulated
C) shouldn’t demand that Ingham be disciplined for voicing her views
D) shouldn’t appease the opposition in such a quiet way
25.	Which of the following statements about Ingham is TRUE?
A) Her testimony hasn’t been supported by the EPA.
B) Her credibility as a scientist hasn’t been undermined.
C) She is firmly supported by her university.
D) She has made great contributions to the study of GM bacteria.
Passage Four
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Every fall, like clockwork, Linda Krentz of Beaverton, Oregon, felt her brain go on strike. “I just couldn’t get going in the morning,” she says. “I’d get depressed and gain 10 pounds every winter and lose them again in the spring.” Then she read about seasonal affective disorder, a form of depression that occurs in fall and winter, and she saw the light-literally. Every morning now she turns on a specially constructed light box for half an hour and sits in front of it to trick her brain into thinking it’s still enjoying those long summer days. It seems to work.
Krentz is not alone. Scientists estimate that 10 million Americans suffer from seasonal depression and 25 million more develop milder versions. But there’s never been definitive proof that treatment with very bright lights makes a difference. After all, it’s hard to do a double-blind test when the subjects can see for themselves whether or not the light is on. That’s why nobody has ever separated the real effects of light therapy from placebo (安慰剂) effects.
Until now. In three separate studies published last month, researchers report not only that light therapy works better than a placebo but that treatment is usually more effective in the early morning than in the evening. In two of the groups, the placebo problem was resolved by telling patients they were comparing light boxes to a new anti-depressant device that emits negatively charged ions (离子). The third used the timing of light therapy as the control.
Why does light therapy work? No one really knows. “Our research suggests it has something to do with shifting the body’s internal clock,” says psychiatrist Dr. Lewey. The body is programmed to start the day with sunrise, he explains, and this gets later as the days get shorter. But why such subtle shifts make some people depressed and not others is a mystery.
That hasn’t stopped thousands of winter depressives from trying to heal themselves. Light boxes for that purpose are available without a doctor’s prescription. That bothers psychologist Michael Terman of Columbia University. He is worried that the boxes may be tried by patients who suffer from mental illness that can’t be treated with light. Terman has developed a questionnaire to help determine whether expert care is needed.
In any event, you should choose a reputable manufacturer. Whatever product you use should emit only visible light, because ultraviolet light damages the eyes. If you are photosensitive (对光敏感的), you may develop a rash. Otherwise, the main drawback is having to sit in front of the light for 30 to 60 minutes in the morning. That’s an inconvenience many winter depressives can live with.
26.	What is the probable cause of Krentz’s problem?
A) An unexpected gain in body weight.
B) Unexplained impairment of her nervous system.
C) Weakening of her eyesight with the setting in of winter.
D) Poor adjustment of her body clock to seasonal changes.
27.	By saying that Linda Krentz saw the light” (Line 4, Para. 1), the author means that she ________.
A) learned how to lose weight
B) realized what her problem was
C) came to see the importance of light
D) became light-hearted and cheerful
28.	What is the CURRENT view concerning the treatment of seasonal depression with bright lights?
A) Its effect remains to be seen.
B) It serves as a kind of placebo.
C) It proves to be an effective therapy.
D) It hardly produces any effects.
29.	What is psychologist Michael Terman’s major concern?
A) Winter depressives will be addicted to using light boxes.
B) No mental patients would bother to consult psychiatrists.
C) Inferior light boxes will emit harmful ultraviolet lights.
D) Light therapy could be misused by certain mental patients.
30.	Which of the following statements is TRUE?
A) Winter depressives prefer light therapy in spite of its inconvenience.
B) Light therapy increases the patient’s photosensitivity.
C) Eye damage is a side effect of light therapy.
D) Light boxes can be programmed to correspond to shifts in the body clock.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Passage one
Too many vulnerable child-free adults are being ruthlessly (无情的) manipulated into parent-hood by their parents, who think that happiness among older people depends on having a grand-child to spoil. We need an organization to help beat down the persistent campaigns of grandchildless parents. It’s time to establish Planned Grandparenthood, which would have many global and local benefits.
Part of its mission would be to promote the risks and realities associated with being a grandparent. The staff would include depressed grandparents who would explain how grandkids break lamps, bite, scream and kick. Others would detail how an hour of baby-sitting often turns into a crying marathon. More grandparents would testify that they had to pay for their grandchild’s expensive college education.
Planned grandparenthood’s carefully written literature would detail all the joys of life grand-child-free a calm living room, extra money for luxuries during the golden years, etc. Potential grandparents would be reminded that, without grandchildren around, it’s possible to have a conversation with your kids, who—incidentally—would have more time for their own parents.
Meanwhile, most children are vulnerable to the enormous influence exerted by grandchildless parents aiming to persuade their kids to produce children. They will take a call from a persistent parent, even if they’re loaded with works. In addition, some parents make handsome money offers payable upon the grandchild’s birth. Sometimes these gifts not only cover expenses associated with the infant’s birth, but extras, too, like a vacation. In any case, cash gifts can weaken the resolve of even the noblest person.
At Planned Grandparenthood, children targeted by their parents to reproduce could obtain non-biased information about the insanity of having their own kids. The catastrophic psychological and economic costs of childbearing would be emphasized. The symptoms of morning sickness would be listed and horrors of childbirth pictured. A monthly newsletter would contain stories about overwhelmed parents and offer guidance on how childless adults can respond to the different lobbying tactics that would-be grandparents employ.
When I think about all the problems of our overpopulated world and look at our boy grabbing at the lamp by the sofa, I wish I could have turned to Planned Grandparenthood when my parents were putting the grandchild squeeze on me.
If I could have, I might not be in this parenthood predicament (窘境). But here’s the crazy irony, I don’t want my child-free life back. Dylan’s too much fun.
21.	What’s the purpose of the proposed organization Planned Grandparenthood?
A) To encourage childless couples to have children.
B) To provide facilities and services for grandchildless parents.
C) To offer counseling to people on how to raise grandchildren.
D) To discourage people from insisting on having grandchildren.
22.	Planned Grandparenthood would include depressed grandparents on its staff in order to ________.
A) show them the joys of life grandparents may have in raising grandchildren
B) draw attention to the troubles and difficulties grandchildren may cause

D) help raise funds to cover the high expense of education for grandchildren
23.	According to the passage, some couples may eventually choose to have children because ________.
A) they find it hard to resist the carrot-and-stick approach of their parents
B) they have learn from other parents about the joys of having children
C) they feel more and more lonely ad they grow older
D) they have found it irrational to remain childless

B) her parents liked to have a grandchild in their arms

D) It is a psychological catastrophe.
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Ask most people how they define the American Dream and chances are they’ll say, “Success.” The dream of individual opportunity has been home in American since Europeans discovered a “new world” in the Western Hemisphere. Early immigrants like Hector St. Jean de Crevecoeur praised highly the freedom and opportunity to be found in this new land. His glowing descriptions of a classless society where anyone could attain success through honesty and hard work fired the imaginations of many European readers: in Letters from an American Farmer (1782) he wrote. “We are all excited at the spirit of an industry which is unfettered (无拘无束的) and unrestrained, because each person works for himself ... We have no princes, for whom we toil (干苦力活)，starve, and bleed: we are the most perfect society now existing in the world.” The promise of a land where “the rewards of a man’s industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labor” drew poor immigrants from Europe and fueled national expansion into the western territories.
Our national mythology (神化) is full of illustration the American success story. There’s Benjamin Franklin, the very model of the self-educated, self-made man, who rose from modest origins to become a well-known scientist, philosopher, and statesman. In the nineteenth century, Horatio Alger, a writer of fiction for young boys, became American’s best-selling author with rags-to-riches tales. The notion of success haunts us: we spend million every year reading about the rich and famous, learning how to “make a fortune in real estate with no money down,” and “dressing for success.” The myth of success has even invaded our personal relationships: today it’s as important to be “successful” in marriage or parenthoods as it is to come out on top in business.
But dreams easily turn into nightmares. Every American who hopes to “make it” also knows the fear of failure, because the myth of success inevitably implies comparison between the haves and the have-nots, the stars and the anonymous crowd. Under pressure of the myth, we become indulged in status symbols: we try to live in the “right” neighborhoods, wear the “right” clothes, eat the “right” foods. These symbols of distinction assure us and others that we believe strongly in the fundamental equality of all, yet strive as hard as we can to separate ourselves from our fellow citizens.
26.	What is the essence of the American Dream according to Crevecoeur?
A) People are free to develop their power of imagination.
B) People who are honest and work hard can succeed.
C) People are free from exploitation and oppression.
D) People can fully enjoy individual freedom.
27.	By saying “the rewards of a man’s industry follow with equal steps the progress of his labor” (Line 10, Para. 1), the author means ________.
A) the more diligent one is, the bigger his returns
B) laborious work ensures the growth of an industry
C) a man’s business should be developed step by step
D) a company’s success depends on its employees’ hard work
28.	The characters described in Horatio Alger’s novels are people who ________.
A) succeed in real estate investment
B) earned enormous fortunes by chances
C) became wealthy after starting life very poor
D) became famous despite their modest origins
29.	It can be inferred from the last sentence of the second paragraph that ________.
A) business success often contributes to a successful marriage
B) Americans wish to succeed in every aspect of life
C) good personal relationships lead to business success
D) successful business people provide good care for their children
30.	What is the paradox of American culture according to the author?
A) The American road to success is full of nightmares.
B) Status symbols are not a real indicator of a person’s wealth.
C) The American Dream is nothing but an empty dream.
D) What Americans strive after often contradicts their beliefs.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Public distrust of scientists stems in part from the blurring of boundaries between science and technology, between discovery and manufacture. Most government, perhaps all governments, justify public expenditure on scientific research in terms of the economic benefits the scientific enterprise ha brought in the past and will bring in the future. Politicians remind their voters of the splendid machines ‘our scientists’ have invented, the new drugs to relieve old ailments (病痛), and the new surgical equipment and techniques by which previously intractable (难治疗的) conditions may now be treated and lives saved. At the same time, the politicians demand of scientists that they tailor their research to ‘economics needs’, that they award a higher priority to research proposals that are ‘near the market’ and can be translated into the greatest return on investment in the shortest time. Dependent, as they are, on politicians for much of their funding, scientists have little choice but to comply. Like the rest of us, they are members of a society that rates the creation of wealth as the greatest possible good. Many have reservations, but keep them to themselves in what they perceive as a climate hostile to the pursuit of understanding for its own sake and the idea of an inquiring, creative spirit.
In such circumstances no one should be too hard on people who are suspicious of conflicts of interest. When we learn that the distinguished professor assuring us of the safety of a particular product holds a consultancy with the company making it, we cannot be blamed for wondering whether his fee might conceivably cloud his professional judgment. Even if the professor holds no consultancy with any firm, some people many still distrust him because of his association with those who do, or at least wonder about the source of some his research funding.
This attitude can have damaging effects. It questions the integrity of individuals working in a profession that prizes intellectual honesty as the supreme virtue, and plays into the hands of those who would like to discredit scientists by representing then a venal (可以收买的). This makes it easier to dismiss all scientific pronouncements, but especially those made by the scientists who present themselves as ‘experts’. The scientist most likely to understand the safety of a nuclear reactor, for example, is a nuclear engineer declares that a reactor is unsafe, we believe him, because clearly it is not to his advantage to lie about it. If he tells us it is safe, on the other hand, we distrust him, because he may well be protecting the employer who pays his salary.
31.	What is the chief concern of most governments when it comes to scientific research?
A) Support from the votes.
B) The reduction of public expenditure.
C) Quick economics returns.
D) The budget for a research project.
32.	Scientist have to adapt their research to ‘economic needs’ in order to ________.
A) impress the public with their achievements
B) pursue knowledge for knowledge’s sake
C) obtain funding from the government
D) translate knowledge into wealth
33.	Why won’t scientists complain about the government’s policy concerning scientific research?
A) They think they work in an environment hostile to the free pursuit of knowledge.
B) They are accustomed to keeping their opinions to themselves.
C) They know it takes patience to win support from the public.
D) They think compliance with government policy is in the interests of the public.
34.	According to the author, people are suspicious of the professional judgment of scientists because ________.
A) their pronouncements often turn out to be wrong
B) sometimes they hide the source of their research funding
C) some of them do not give priority to intellectual honesty
D) they could be influenced by their association with the project concerned
35.	Why does the author say that public distrust of scientists can have damaging effects?
A) It makes things difficult for scientists seeking research funds.
B) People would not believe scientists even when they tell the truth.
C) It may dampen the enthusiasm of scientists for independent research.
D) Scientists themselves may doubt the value of their research findings.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
In many ways, today’s business environment has changed qualitatively since the late 1980s. The end of the Cold War radically altered the very nature of the world’s politics and economics. In just a few short years, globalization has started a variety of trends with profound consequences: the opening of markets, true global competition, widespread deregulation (解除政府对…的控制) of industry, and an abundance of accessible capital. We have experienced both the benefits and risks of a truly global economy, with both Wall Street and Main Street (平民百姓) feeling the pains of economic disorder half a world away.
At the same time, we have fully entered the Information Age, Starting breakthroughs in information technology have irreversibly altered the ability to conduct business unconstrained by the traditional limitations of time or space. Today, it’s almost impossible to imagine a world without intranets, e-mail, and portable computers. With stunning speed, the Internet is profoundly changing the way we work, shop, do business, and communicate.
As a consequence, we have truly entered the Post-Industrial economy. We are rapidly shifting from an economy based on manufacturing and commodities to one that places the greatest value on information, services, support, and distribution. That shift, in turn, place an unprecedented premium on “knowledge workers,” a new class of wealthy, educated, and mobile people who view themselves as free agents in a seller’s market.
Beyond the realm of information technology, the accelerated pace of technological change in virtually every industry has created entirely new business, wiped out others, and produced a Pervasive (广泛的) demand for continuous innovation. New product, process, and distribution technologies provide powerful levers for creating competitive value. More companies are learning the importance of destructive technologies—innovations that hold the potential to make a product line, or even an entire business segment, virtually outdated.
Another major trend has been the fragmentation of consumer and business markets. There’s a growing appreciation that superficially similar groups of customers may have very different preferences in terms of what they want to buy and how they want to buy it. Now, new technology makes it easier, faster, and cheaper to identify and serve targeted micro-markets in ways that were physically impossible or prohibitively expensive in the past. Moreover, the trend feeds on itself, a business’s ability to serve sub-markets fuels customers’ appetites for more and more specialized offerings.
36.	According to the first paragraph, the chances in the business environment in the past decades can be attributed to ________.
A) technological advances
B) worldwide economic disorder
C) the fierce competition in industry
D) the globalization of economy
37.	what idea does the author want to convey in the second paragraph?
A) The rapid development of information technology has taken businessmen by surprise.
B) Information technology has removed the restrictions of time and space in business transactions.
C) The Internet, intranets, e-mail, and portable computers have penetrated every corner of the world.
D) The way we do business today has brought about startling breakthroughs in information technology.
38.	If a business wants to thrive in the Post-Industrial economy, ________.
A) it has to invest more capital in the training of free agents to operate in a seller’s market
B) it should try its best to satisfy the increasing demands of mobile knowledgeable people
C) it should not overlook the importance of information, services, support, and distribution
D) it has to provide each of its employees with the latest information about the changing market
39.	In the author’s view, destructive technologies are innovations which ________.
A) can eliminate an entire business segment
B) demand a radical change in providing services
C) may destroy the potential of a company to make any profit
D) call for continuous improvement in ways of doing business
40.	With the fragmentation of consumer and business markets ________.
A) an increasing number of companies have disintegrated
B) manufacturers must focus on one special product to remain competitive in the market
C) it is physically impossible and prohibitively expensive to do business in the old way
D) businesses have to meet individual customers’ specific needs in order to succeed

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
There are good reasons to be troubled by the violence that spreads throughout the media. Movies, Television and video games are full of gunplay and bloodshed, and one might reasonably ask what’s wrong with a society that presents videos of domestic violence as entertainment.
Most researchers agree that the causes of real-world violence are complex. A 1993 study by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences listed “biological, individual, family, peer, school, and community factors” as all playing their parts.
Viewing abnormally large amounts of violent television and video games may well contribute to violent behavior in certain individuals. The trouble comes when researchers downplay uncertainties in their studies or overstate the case for causality (因果关系). Skeptics were dismayed several years ago when a group of societies including the American Medical Association tried to end the debate by issuing a joint statement: “At this time, well over 1,000 studies... point overwhelmingly to a causal connection between media violence and aggressive behavior in some children.”
Freedom-of-speech advocates accused the societies of catering to politicians, and even disputed the number of studies (most were review articles and essays, they said). When Jonathan Freedman, a social psychologist at the University of Toronto, reviewed the literature, he found only 200 or so studies of television-watching and aggression. And when he weeded out “the most doubtful measures of aggression”, only 28% supported a connection.
The critical point here is causality. The alarmists say they have proved that violent media cause aggression. But the assumptions behind their observations need to be examined. When labeling games as violent or non-violent, should a hero eating a ghost really be counted as a violent event? And when experimenters record the time it takes game players to read ‘aggressive’ or ‘non-aggressive’ words from a list, can we be sure what they are actually measuring? The intent of the new Harvard Center on Media and Child Health to collect and standardize studies of media violence in order to compare their methodologies, assumptions and conclusions is an important step in the right direction.
Another appropriate step would be to tone down the criticism until we know more. Several researchers write, speak and testify quite a lot on the threat posed by violence in the media. That is, of course, their privilege. But when doing so, they often come out with statements that the matter has now been settled, drawing criticism from colleagues. In response, the alarmists accuse critics and news reporters of being deceived by the entertainment industry. Such clashes help neither science nor society.

A) There is a lot of violence in the real world today.
B) Something has gone wrong with today’s society.
C) Many people are fond of gunplay and bloodshed.
D) Showing violence is thought to be entertaining.
22.	What is the skeptics (Line 3. Para. 3) view of media violence?

B) Most studies exaggerate the effect of media violence on the viewers.
C) A causal relationship exists between media and real-world violence.
D) The influence of media violence on children has been underestimated.
23.	The author uses the term “alarmists” (Line 1. Para. 5) to refer to those who ________.

D) He more than agrees with the views held by the alarmists.
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
You’re in trouble if you have to buy your own brand-name prescription drugs. Over the past decade, prices leaped by more than double the inflation rate. Treatments for chronic conditions can easily top $2,000 a month-no wonder that one in four Americans can’s afford to fill their prescriptions. The solution? A hearty chorus of “O Canada.” North of the border, where price controls reign, those same brand-name drugs cost 50% to 80% less.
The Canadian option is fast becoming a political wake-up call, “If our neighbors can buy drugs at reasonable prices, why can’t we? Even to whisper that thought provokes anger. “Un-American!” And-the propagandists’ trump card (王牌)—“Wreck our brilliant health-care system.” Supersize drug prices, they claim, fund the research that sparks the next generation of wonder drugs. No sky-high drug price today, no cure for cancer tomorrow. So shut up and pay up.
Common sense tells you that’s a false alternative. The reward for finding, say, a cancer cure is so huge that no one’s going to hang it up. Nevertheless, if Canada-level pricing came to the United States, the industry’s profit margins would drop and the pace of new-drug development would slow. Here lies the American dilemma. Who is all this splendid medicine for? Should our health-care system continue its drive toward the best of the best, even though rising numbers of patients can’t afford it? Or should we direct our wealth toward letting everyone in on today’s level of care? Measured by saved lives, the latter is almost certainly the better course.
To defend their profits, the drug companies have warned Canadian wholesalers and pharmacies (药房) not to sell to Americans by mail, and are cutting back supplies to those who dare.
Meanwhile, the administration is playing the fear card. Officials from the Food and Drug Administration will argue that Canadian drugs might be fake, mishandled, or even a potential threat to life.
Do bad drugs fly around the Internet? Sure-and the more we look, the more we’ll find, But I haven’t heard of any raging epidemics among the hundreds of thousands of people buying crossborder.
Most users of prescription drugs don’t worry about costs a lot. They’re sheltered by employee insurance, owing just a $20 co-pay. The financial blows rain, instead, on the uninsured, especially the chronically ill who need expensive drugs to live, This group will still include middle-income seniors on Medicare, who’ll have to dig deeply into their pockets before getting much from the new drug benefit that starts in 2006.
26.	What is said about the consequence of the rocketing drug prices in the U.S.?
A) A quarter of Americans can’t afford their prescription drugs.
B) Many Americans can’t afford to see a doctor when they fall ill.
C) Many Americans have to go to Canada to get medical treatment.
D) The inflation rate has been more than doubled over the years.
27.	It can be inferred that America can follow the Canadian model and curb its soaring drug prices by ________.
A) encouraging people to buy prescription drugs online
B) extending medical insurance to all its citizens
C) importing low-price prescription drugs from Canada
D) exercising price control on brand-name drugs
28.	How do propagandists argue for the U.S. drug pricing policy?
A) Low prices will affect the quality of medicines in America.
B) High prices are essential to funding research on new drugs.
C) Low prices will bring about the anger of drug manufacturers.
D) High-price drugs are indispensable in curing chronic diseases.
29.	What should be the priority of America’s health-care system according to the author?
A) To resolve the dilemma in the health-care system.
B) To maintain America’s lead in the drug industry.
C) To allow the vast majority to enjoy its benefits.
D) To quicken the pace of new drug development.
30.	What are American drug companies doing to protect their high profits?

B) Threatening to cut back funding for new drug research.
C) Reducing supplies to uncooperative Canadian pharmacies.
D) Attributing the raging epidemics to the ineffectiveness of Canadian drugs.
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Age has its privileges in America. And one of the more prominent of them is the senior citizen discount. Anyone who has reached a certain age—in some cases as low as 55—is automatically entitled to a dazzling array of price reductions at nearly every level of commercial life. Eligibility is determined not by one’s need but by the date on one’s birth certificate. Practically unheard of a generation ago, the discounts have become a routine part of many businesses—as common as color televisions in motel rooms and free coffee on airliners.
People with gray hair often are given the discounts without even asking for them；yet, millions of Americans above age 60 are healthy and solvent (有支付能力的). Businesses that would never dare offer discounts to college students or anyone under 30 freely offer them to older Americans. The practice is acceptable because of the widespread belief that “elderly” and “needy” are synonymous (同义的). Perhaps that once was true, but today elderly Americans as a group have a lower poverty rate than the rest of the population. To be sure, there is economic diversity within the elderly, and many older Americans are poor, But most of them aren’t.
It is impossible to determine the impact of the discounts on individual companies. For many firms, they are a stimulus to revenue. But in other cases the discounts are given at the expense, directly or indirectly, of younger Americans. Moreover, they are a direct irritant in what some politicians and scholars see as a coming conflict between the generations.
Generational tensions are being fueled by continuing debate over Social Security benefits, which mostly involves a transfer of resources from the young to the old. Employment is another sore point, Buoyed (支持) by laws and court decisions, more and more older Americans are declining the retirement dinner in favor of staying on the job-thereby lessening employment and promotion opportunities for younger workers.
Far from a kind of charity they once were, senior citizen discounts have become a formidable economic privilege to a group with millions of members who don’t need them.
It no longer makes sense to treat the elderly as a single group whose economic needs deserve priority over those of others. Senior citizen discounts only enhance the myth that older people can’t take care of themselves and need special treatment； and they threaten the creation of a new myth, that the elderly are ungrateful and taking for themselves at the expense of children and other age groups. Senior citizen discounts are the essence of the very thing older Americans are fighting against-discrimination by age.
31.	We learn from the first paragraph that ________.
A) offering senior citizens discounts has become routine commercial practice
B) senior citizen discounts have enabled many old people to live a decent life
C) giving senior citizens discounts has boosted the market for the elderly
D) senior citizens have to show their birth certificates to get a discount
32.	What assumption lies behind the practice of senior citizen discounts?
A) Businesses, having made a lot of profits, should do something for society in return.
B) Old people are entitled to special treatment for the contribution they made to society.
C) The elderly, being financially underprivileged, need humane help from society.
D) Senior citizen discounts can make up for the inadequacy of the Social Security system.
33.	According to some politicians and scholars, senior citizen discounts will ________.
A) make old people even more dependent on society
B) intensify conflicts between the young and the old
C) have adverse financial impact on business companies
D) bring a marked increase in the companies revenues
34.	How does the author view the Social Security system?
A) It encourages elderly people to retire in time.
B) It opens up broad career prospects for young people.
C) It benefits the old at the expense of the young.
D) It should be reinforced by laws and court decisions.
35.	Which of the following best summarizes the author’s main argument?
A) Senior citizens should fight hard against age discrimination.
B) The elderly are selfish and taking senior discounts for granted.
C) Priority should be given to the economic needs of senior citizens.
D) Senior citizen discounts may well be a type of age discrimination.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
In 1854 my great-grandfather, Morris Marable, was sold on an auction block in Georgia for $500. For his white slave master, the sale was just “business as usual.” But to Morris Marable and his heirs, slavery was a crime against our humanity. This pattern of human rights violations against enslaved African-Americans continued under racial segregation for nearly another century.
The fundamental problem of American democracy in the 21st century is the problem of “structural racism” the deep patterns of socio-economic inequality and accumulated disadvantage that are coded by race, and constantly justified in public speeches by both racist stereotypes and white indifference. Do Americans have the capacity and vision to remove these structural barriers that deny democratic rights and opportunities to millions of their fellow citizens?
This country has previously witnessed two great struggles to achieve a truly multicultural democracy.
The First Reconstruction (1865-1877) ended slavery and briefly gave black men voting rights, but gave no meaningful compensation for two centuries of unpaid labor. The promise of “40 acres and a mule (骡子)”was for most blacks a dream deferred (尚未实现的).
The Second Reconstruction (1954-1968), or the modern civil rights movement, ended legal segregation in public accommodations and gave blacks voting rights. But these successes paradoxically obscure the tremendous human costs of historically accumulated disadvantage that remain central to black Americans’ lives.
The disproportionate wealth that most whites enjoy today was first constructed from centuries of unpaid black labor. Many white institutions, including some leading universities, insurance companies and banks, profited from slavery. This pattern of white privilege and black inequality continues today.
Demanding reparations (赔偿) is not just about compensation for slavery and segregation. It is, more important, an educational campaign to highlight the contemporary reality of “racial deficits” of all kinds, the unequal conditions that impact blacks regardless of class. Structural racism’s barriers include “equity inequity.” the absence of black capital formation that is a direct consequence of America’s history. One third of all black households actually have negative net wealth. In 1998 the typical black family’s net wealth was $16,400, less than one fifth that of white families. Black families are denied home loans at twice the rate of whites.
Blacks remain the last hired and first fired during recessions. During the 1990-91 recession, African-Americans suffered disproportionately. At Coca-Cola, 42 percent of employees who lost their jobs were blacks. At Sears, 54 percent were black, Blacks have significantly shorter life spans, in part due to racism in the health establishment. Blacks are statistically less likely than whites to be referred for kidney transplants or early-stage cancer surgery.
36.	To the author, the auction of his great-grandfather is a typical example of ________.
A) crime against humanity
B) unfair business transaction
C) racial conflicts in Georgia
D) racial segregation in America
37.	The barrier to democracy in 21st century America is ________.
A) widespread use of racist stereotypes

D) denial of legal rights to ordinary blacks
38.	What problem remains unsolved in the two Reconstructions?
A) Differences between races are deliberately obscured.
B) The blacks are not compensated for their unpaid labor.
C) There is no guarantee for blacks to exercise their rights.
D) The interests of blacks are not protected by law.
39.	It is clear that the wealth enjoyed by most whites ________.
A) has resulted from business successes over the years
B) has been accompanied by black capital formation
C) has derived from sizable investments in education
D) has been accumulated from generations of slavery
40.	What does the author think of the current situation regarding racial discrimination?
A) Racism is not a major obstacle to blacks’ employment.
B) Inequality of many kinds remains virtually untouched.
C) A major step has been taken towards reparations.
D) Little has been done to ensure blacks’ civil rights.

Until recently, dyslexia and other reading problems were a mystery to most teachers and parents. As a result, too many kids passed through school without master the printed page. (S1) Some were treated as mentally deficient: many were left functionally illiterate (文盲的)，unable to ever meet their potential. But in the last several years, there’s been a revolution in that we’ve learned about reading and dyslexia. (S2) Scientists are using a variety of new imaging techniques to watch the brain at work. Their experiments have shown that reading disorders are most likely the result of what is, in an effect, (S3) faulty wiring in the brain—not lazy, stupidity or a poor home (S4) environment. There’s also convincing evidence which dyslexia (S5) is largely inherited. It is now considered a chronic problem for some kids, not just a “phase”. Scientists have also discarded another old stereotype that almost all dyslexics are boys. Studies indicate that many girls are affecting as well (S6) and not getting help.
At same time, educational researchers have come up (S7) with innovative teaching strategies for kids who are having trouble learning to read. New screening tests are identifying children at risk before they get discouraged by year of (S8) frustration and failure. And educators are trying to get the message to parents that they should be on the alert for the first signs of potential problems.
It’s an urgent mission. Mass literacy is a relative new (S9) social goal. A hundred years ago people didn’t need to be good readers in order to earn a living. But in the Information Age, no one can get by with knowing how to read well and (S10) understand increasingly complex material.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A) B) C) and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Each summer, no matter how pressing my work schedule, I take off one day exclusively for my son. We call it dad-son day. This year our third stop was the amusement park, where be discovered that he was tall enough to ride one of the fastest roller coasters (过山车) in the world. We blasted through face-stretching turns and loops for ninety seconds. Then, as we stepped off the ride, be shrugged and, in a distressingly calm voice, remarked that it was not as exciting as other rides he’d been on. As I listened, I began to sense something seriously out of balance.
Throughout the season, I noticed similar events all around me. Parents seemed hard pressed to find new thrills for indifferent kids. Surrounded by ever-greater stimulation, their young faces were looking disappointed and bored.
Facing their children’s complaints of “nothing to do“, parents were shelling out large numbers of dollars for various forms of entertainment. In many cases the money seemed to do little more than buy transient relief from the terrible moans of their bored children. This set me pondering the obvious question:“ How can it be so hard for kids to find something to do when there’s never been such a range of stimulating entertainment available to them?”
What really worries me is the intensity of the stimulation. I watch my little daughter’s face as she absorbs the powerful onslaught (冲击) of arousing visuals and bloody special effects in movies.
Why do children immersed in this much excitement seem starved for more? That was, I realized, the point. I discovered during my own reckless adolescence that what creates excitement is not going fast, but going faster. Thrills have less to do with speed than changes in speed.
I’m concerned about the cumulative effect of years at these levels of feverish activity. It is no mystery to me why many teenagers appear apathetic (麻木的) and burned out, with a “been there, done that” air of indifference toward much of life. As increasing numbers of friends’ children are prescribed medications-stimulants to deal with inattentiveness at school or anti-depressants to help with the loss of interest and joy in their lives-I question the role of kids’ boredom in some of the diagnoses.
My own work is focused on the chemical imbalances and biological factors related to behavioral and emotional disorders. These are complex problems. Yet I’ve been reflecting more and more on how the pace of life and the intensity of stimulation may be contributing to the rising rates of psychiatric problems among children and adolescents in our society.

A) unless their parents can find new thrills for them
B) when they don’t have any access to stimulating fun games

Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
It used to be that people were proud to work for the same company for the whole of their working lives. They’d get a gold watch at the end of their productive years and a dinner featuring speeches by their bosses praising their loyalty. But today’s rich capitalists have regressed (倒退) to the “survival of the fittest” ideas and their loyalty extends not to their workers or even to their stockholders but only to themselves. Instead of giving out gold watches worth a hundred or so dollars for forty or so years of word, they grab tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars as they sell for their own profit the company they may have been with for only a few years.
The new rich selfishly act on their own to unfairly grab the wealth that the country as a whole has produced. The top 1 percent of the population now has wealth equal to the whole bottom 95 percent and they want more. Their selfishness is most shamelessly expressed in downsizing and outsourcing (将产品包给分公司做) because these business maneuvers don’t act to created new jobs as the founder of new industries used to do, but only out jobs while keeping the money value of what those jobs produced for themselves.
To keep the money machine working smoothly the rich have bought all the politicians from the top down. The president himself is constantly leaving Washington and the business at the nation because he is summoned to “fundraising dinners” where fat cats pay a thousand or so dollars a plate to worm their way into government not through service but through donations of vast amounts of money. Once on the inside they have both political parties busily tearing up all the regulations that protect the rest of us from the greed of the rich.
The middle class used to be loyal to the free enterprise system. In the past, the people of the middle class mostly thought they’d be rich themselves someday or have a good shot at becoming rich. But nowadays income is being distributed more and more unevenly and corporate loyalty is a thing of the past. The middle class may also wake up to forget its loyalty to the so-called free enterprise system altogether and the government which governs only the rest of us while letting the corporations do what they please with our jobs. As things stand, if somebody doesn’t wake up, the middle class is on a path to being downsized all the way to the bottom of society.
26.	It can be inferred from the first paragraph that people used to place a high value on ________.
A) job security
B) bosses’ praise
C) corporate loyalty
D) retirement benefits
27.	The author is strongly critical of today’s rich capitalists for ________.
A) not giving necessary assistance to laid-off workers
B) maximizing their profits at the expense of workers
C) not setting up long-term goals for their companies
D) rewarding only those who are considered the fittest
28.	The immediate consequence of the new capitalists’ practice is ________.
A) loss of corporate reputation
B) lower pay for the employees
C) a higher rate of unemployment
D) a decline in business transactions
29.	The rich try to sway the policy of the government by ________.
A) occupying important positions in both political parties
B) making monetary contributions to decision-makers
C) pleasing the public with generous donations
D) constantly hosting fundraising dinners
30.	What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage?
A) to call on the middle class to remain loyal to the free enterprise system
B) to warn the government of the shrinking of the American middle class
C) to persuade the government to change its current economic policies
D) to urge the middle class to wake up and protect their own interests
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Intel chairman Andy Grove has decided to cut the Gordian knot of controversy surrounding stem cell research by simply writing a check.
The check, which he pledged last week, could be for as much as 55 million, depending on how many donors make gifts of between 550,000 and 5,500,000, which he has promised to match. It will be made out to the University of California-San Francisco (UCSF).
Thanks in part to such private donations, university research into uses for human stem cells—the cells at the earliest stages of development that can form any body part—will continue in California. With private financial support, the state will be less likely to lose talented scientists who would be tempted to leave the field or even leave the country as research dependent on federal money slows to glacial (极其缓慢的) pace.
Hindered by limits President Bush placed on stem cell research a year age, scientists are turning to laboratories that can carry out work without using federal money. This is awkward for universities, which must spend extra money building separate labs and keeping rigor cots records proving no federal funds were involved. Grove’s donation, a first step toward a $20 million target at UCSF, will ease the burden.
The president’s decision a year ago to allow research on already existing stem cell lines was portrayed as a reasonable compromise between scientists’ needs for cells to work with, and concerns that this kind of research could lead to wholesale creation and destruction of human embryos (胚胎), cloned infants and a general contempt for human life.
But Bush’s effort to please both sides ended up pleasing neither. And it certainly didn’t provide the basis for cutting edge research. Of the 78 existing stem cell lines which Bush said are all that science would ever need, only one is in this country (at the University of Wisconsin) and only five are ready for distribution to researchers. All were grown in conjunction with mouse cells, making future therapeutic (治疗的) uses unlikely.
The Bush administration seems bent on satisfying the small but vocal group of Americans who oppose stem cell research under any conditions. Fortunately, Grove and others are more interested in advancing scientific research that could benefit the large number of Americans who suffer from Parkinson’s disease, nerve injuries, heart diseases and many other problems.
31.	When Andy Grove decided to cut the Gordian knot, he meat to ________.
A) put an end to stem cell research
B) end Intel’s relations with Gordian
C) settle the dispute on stem cell research quickly
D) expel Gordian from stem cell research for good
32.	For UCSF to carry on stem cell research, new funds have to come from ________.
A) interested businesses and individuals
B) the United States federal government
C) a foundation set up by the Intel Company
D) executives of leading American companies
33.	As a result of the limit Bust placed on stem cell research. American universities will ________.
A) conduct the research in laboratories overseas
B) abandon the research altogether in the near future
C) have to carry out the research secretly
D) have to raise money to build separate labs
34.	We may infer from the passage that future therapeutic uses of stem cells will be unlikely unless ________.
A) human stem cells are used in the research
B) a lot more private donations can be secured
C) more federal money is used for the research
D) talented scientists are involved in the research
35.	The reason lying behind President Bush’s placing limits on stem cell research is that ________.
A) his administration is financially pinched
B) he did not want to offend its opponents
C) it amounts to a contempt for human life
D) it did not promise any therapeutic value
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
This looks like the year that hard-pressed tenants in California will relief-not just in the marketplace, where tents have eased, but from the state capital Sacramento.
Two significant tenant reforms stand a good chance of passage. One bill, which will give more time to tenants being evicted (逐出), will soon be heading to the governor’s desk. The other, protecting security deposits, faces a vote in the Senate on Monday.
For more than a century, landlords in California have been able to force tenants out with only 30 days’ notice. That will now double under SB 1403, which got through the Assembly recently. The new protection will apply only to renters who have been in an apartment for at least a year.
Even 60 days in a tight housing market won’t be long enough for some families to find an apartment near where their kids go to school. But is will be an improvement in cities like San Jose, where renters rights groups charge that unscrupulous (不择手段的) landlords have kicked out tenants on short notice to put up tents.
The California Landlords Association argued that landlords shouldn’t have to wait 60 days to get rid of problem tenants. But the bill gained support when a Japanese real estate investor sent out 30-day eviction notices to 550 families renting homes in Sacramento and Santa Rosa. The landlords lobby eventually dropped its opposition and instead turned its forces against AB 2330, regarding security deposits.
Sponsored by Assemblywoman Carole Migden of San Francisco, the bill would establish a procedure and a timetable for tenants to get back security deposits.
Some landlords view security deposits as a free month’s rent, theirs for the taking. In most cases, though, there are honest disputes over damages-what constitutes ordinary wear and tear
AB 2330 would give a tenant the right to request a walk-through with the landlord and to make the repairs before moving out; reputable landlords already do this. It would increase the penalty for failing to return a deposit.
The original bill would have required the landlord to pay interest on the deposit. The landlords lobby protested that it would involve too much paperwork over too little money-less than $10 a year on a $1,000 deposit, at current rates. On Wednesday, the sponsor dropped the interest section to increase the chance of passage.
Even in its amended form, AB 2330 is, like SB 1403, vitally important for tenants and should be made state law.
36.	We learn from the passage that SB 1403 will benefit ________.
A) long-term real estate investors
B) short-term tenants in Sacramento
C) landlords in the State of California
D) tenants renting a house over a year
37.	A 60-day notice before eviction may not be early enough for renters because ________.
A) moving house is something difficult to arrange
B) appropriate housing may not be readily available
C) more time is needed for their kids’ school registration
D) the furnishing of the new house often takes a long time
38.	Very often landlords don’t return tenants’ deposits on the pretext that ________.
A) their rent has not been paid in time
B) there has been ordinary wear and tear
C) tenants have done damage to the house
D) the 30-day notice for moving out is over
39.	Why did the sponsor of the AB 2330 bill finally give in on the interest section?
A) To put an end to a lengthy argument.
B) To urge landlords to lobby for its passage.
C) To cut down the heavy paperwork for its easy passage.
D) To make it easier for the State Assembly to pass the bill.
40.	It can be learned from the passage that ________.
A) both bills are likely to be made state laws
B) neither bill will pass through the Assembly
C) AB 2330 stands a better chance of passage
D) Sacramento and San Jose support SB 1403

The most important starting point for improving the understanding of silence is undoubtedly an adequate scientific education at school. Public attitudes towards science owe much the way science is taught in these (S1) institutions. Today, school is what most people come into (S2) contact with a formal instruction and explanation of science for the first time, at least in a systematic way. It is at this point which the foundations are laid for an interest in science. (S3) What is taught (and how) in this first encounter will largely determine an individual’s view of the subject in adult life.
Understanding the original of the negative attitudes (S4) towards science may help us to modify them. Most education system neglect exploration, understanding and reflection. (S5) Teachers in schools tend to present science as a collection of facts, often by more detail than necessary. As a result, (S6) children memorize processes such as mathematical formulas or the periodic table, only to forget it shortly afterwards. The (S7) task of learning facts and concepts, one at a time, makes learning laborious, boring and efficient. Such a purely (S8) empirical approach, which consists of observation and description, is also, in a sense, unscientific or incomplete. There is therefore a need for resources and methods of teaching that facilitates a deep understanding of science in (S9) an enjoyable way. Science should not only be “fun” in the same way as playing a video game, but ‘hard fun’—deep feeling of connection made possibly only imaginative (S10) engagement.

Space Tourism
Make your reservations now. The space tourism industry is officially open for business, and tickets are going for a mere $20 million for a one-week stay in space. Despite reluctance from National Air and Space Administration (NASA)，Russia made American businessman Dennis Tito the world’s first space tourist. Tito flew into space aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket that arrived at the International Space Station (ISS) on April 30, 2001. The second space tourist, South African businessman Mark Shuttleworth, took off aboard the Russian Soyuz on April 25, 2002, also bound for the ISS.
Lance Bass of ‘N Sync was supposed to be the third to make the $20 million trip, but he did not join the three-man crew as they blasted off on October 30, 2002, due to lack of payment. Probably the most incredible aspect of this proposed space tour was that NASA approved of it.
These trips are the beginning of what could be a profitable 21st century industry. There are already several space tourism companies planning to build suborbital vehicles and orbital cities within the next two decades. These companies have invested millions, believing that the space tourism industry is on the verge of taking off.
In 1997, NASA published a report concluding that selling trips into space to private citizens could be worth billions of dollars. A Japanese report supports these findings, and projects that space tourism could be a $10 billion per year industry within the next two decades. The only obstacles to opening up space to tourists are the space agencies, who are concerned with safety and the development of a reliable, reusable launch vehicle.
Space Accommodations
Russia’s Mir space station was supposed to be the first destination for space tourists. But in March 2001，the Russian Aerospace Agency brought Mir down into the Pacific Ocean. As it turned out, bringing down Mir only temporarily delayed the first tourist trip into space.
The Mir crash did cancel plans for a new reality-based game show from NBC, which was going to be called Destination Mir. The Survivor-like TV show was scheduled to air in fall 2001, Participants on the show were to go through training at Russia’s cosmonaut (宇航员) training center, Star City. Each week, one of the participants would be eliminated from the show, with the winner receiving a trip to the Mir space station. The Mir crash has ruled out NBC’s space plans for now. NASA is against beginning space tourism until the International Space Station is completed in 2006.
Russia is not alone in its interest in space tourism. There are several projects underway to commercialize space travel. Here are a few of the groups that might take tourists to space:
	Space Island Group is going to build a ring-shaped, rotating “commercial space infrastructure (基础结构)” that will resemble the Discovery spacecraft in the movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Space Island says it will build its space city out of empty NASA space-shuttle fuel tanks (to start, it should take around 12 or so), and place it about 400 miles above Earth. The space city will rotate once per minute to create a gravitational pull one-third as strong as Earth’s.
	According to their vision statement. Space Adventures plans to “fly tens of thousand of people in space over the next 10-15 years and beyond, around the moon, and back, from spaceports both on Earth and in space, to and from private space stations, and board dozen of different vehicles...”
	Even Hilton Hotels has shown interest in the space tourism industry and possibility of building or co-funding a space hotel. However, the company did say that it believes such a space hotel is 15 to 20 years away.
Initially, space tourism will offer simple accommodations at best. For instance, if the International Space Station is used as a tourist attraction, guests won’t find the luxurious surroundings of a hotel room on Earth. It has been designed for conducting research, not entertainment. However, the first generation of space hotels should offer tourists a much more comfortable experience.
In regard to a concept for a space hotel initially planned by Space Island, such a hotel could offer guests every convenience they might find at a hotel on Earth, and some they might not. The small gravitational pull created by the rotating space city would allow space-tourists and residents to walk around and function facilities would be possible. Additionally, space tourists would even be able to take space walks.
Many of these companies believe that they have to offer an extremely enjoyable experience in order for passengers to pay thousands, if not millions, of dollars to ride into space. So will space create another separation between the haves and have-nots?
The Most Expensive Vacation
Will space be an exotic retreat reserved for only the wealthy? Or will middle-class folks have a chance to take their families to space? Make no mistake about it, going to space will be the most expensive vacation you ever take. Prices right now are in the tens of millions of dollars. Currently, the only vehicles that can take you into space are the space shuttle and the Russian Soyuz, both of which are terribly inefficient. Each spacecraft requires millions of pounds of fuel to take off into space, which makes them expensive to launch. One pound of payload (有效载重) costs about $10,000 to put into Earth’s orbit.
NASA and Lockheed Martin are currently developing a single-stage-to-orbit launch space plane, called the VentureStar, that could be launched for about a tenth of what the space shuttle costs to launch. If the VentureStar takes off, the number of people who could afford to take a trip into space would move into the millions.
In 1998, a joint report from NASA and the Space Transportation Association stated that improvements in technology could push fares for space travel as low as $50,000, and possibly down to $20,000 or $10,000 a decade later. The report concluded that a ticket price of $50,000, there could be 500,000 passengers flying into space each year. While still leaving out many people, these prices would open up space to a tremendous amount of traffic.
Since the beginning of the space race, the general public has said, “Isn’t that great—when do I get to go?” Well, our chance might be closer than ever. Within the next 20 years, space planes could be taking off for the Moon at the same frequency as airplanes flying between New York and Los Angles.

Part IV Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth) (25 minutes)
Section A
Directions:	In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
I’ve heard from and talked to many people who described how Mother Nature simplified their lives for them. They’d lost their home and many or all of their possessions through fires, floods, earthquakes, or some other disaster. Losing everything you own under such circumstances can be distressing, but the people I’ve heard from all saw their loss, ultimately as a blessing.
“The fire saved us the agony of deciding what to keep and what to get rid of,” one woman wrote. And once all those things were no longer there, she and her husband saw how they had weighed them down and complicate their lives.
“There was so much stuff we never used and that was just taking up space. We vowed when we started over, we’d replace only what we needed, and this time we’d do it right. We’ve kept our promise: we don’t have much now, but what we have is exactly what we want.”
Though we’ve never had a catastrophic loss such as that, Gibbs and I did have a close call shortly before we decided to simplify. At that time we lived in a fire zone. One night a firestorm rages through and destroyed over six hundred homes in our community. That tragedy gave us the opportunity to look objectively at the goods we’d accumulated.
We saw that there was so much we could get rid of and only never miss, but be better off without. Having almost lost it all, we found it much easier to let go of the things we knew we’d never use again.
Obviously, there’s a tremendous difference between getting rid of possessions and losing them through a natural disaster without having a say in the matter. And this is not to minimize the tragedy and pain such a loss can generate.
But you might think about how you would approach the acquisition process if you had it to do all over again. Look around your home and make a list of what you would replace.
Make another list of things you wouldn’t acquire again no matter what, and in fact would be happy to be rid of.
When you’re ready to start unloading some of your stuff, that list will be a good place to start.

Section B
Directions:	There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C), and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
In a purely biological sense, fear begins with the body’s system for reacting to things that can harm us—the so-called fight-or-flight response. “An animal that can’t detect danger can’t stay alive,” says Joseph LeDoux. Like animals, humans evolved with an elaborate mechanism for processing information about potential threats. At its core is a cluster of neurons (神经元) deep in the brain known as the amygdale (扁桃核).
LeDoux studies the way animals and humans respond to threats to understand how we form memories of significant events in our lives. The amygdale receives input from many parts of the brain, including regions responsible for retrieving memories. Using this information, the amygdale appraises a situation—I think this charging dog wants to bite me—and triggers a response by radiating nerve signals throughout the body. These signals produce the familiar signs of distress: trembling, perspiration and fast-moving feet, just to name three.
This fear mechanism is critical to the survival of all animals, but no one can say for sure whether beasts other than humans know they’re afraid. That is, as LeDoux says, “if you put that system into a brain that has consciousness, then you get the feeling of fear.”
Humans, says Edward M. Hallowell, have the ability to call up images of bad things that happened in the past and to anticipate future events. Combine these higher thought processes with our hardwired danger-detection systems, and you get a near-universal human phenomenon: worry.
That’s not necessarily a bad thing, says Hallowell. “When used properly, worry is an incredible device,” he says. After all, a little healthy worrying is okay if it leads to constructive action—like having a doctor look at that weird spot on your back.
Hallowell insists, though, that there’s a right way to worry. “Never do it alone, get the facts and then make a plan.” He says. Most of us have survived a recession, so we’re familiar with the belt-tightening strategies needed to survive a slump.
Unfortunately, few of us have much experience dealing with the threat of terrorism, so it’s been difficult to get fact about how we should respond. That’s why Hallowell believes it was okay for people to indulge some extreme worries last fall by asking doctors for Cipro (抗炭疽菌的药物) and buying gas masks.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
Amitai Etzioni is not surprised by the latest headings about scheming corporate crooks (骗子). As a visiting professor at the Harvard Business School in 1989, he ended his work there disgusted with his students’ overwhelming lost for money. “They’re taught that profit is all that matters,” he says. “Many schools don’t even offer ethics (伦理学) courses at all.”
Etzioni expressed his frustration about the interests of his graduate students. “By and large, I clearly had not found a way to help classes full of MBAs see that there is more to life than money, power, fame and self-interest.” He wrote at the time. Today he still takes the blame for not educating these “business-leaders-to-be.” “I really like I failed them,” he says. “If I was a better teacher maybe I could have reached them.”
Etzioni was a respected ethics expert when he arrived at Harvard. He hoped his work at the university would give him insight into how questions of morality could be applied to places where self-interest flourished. What he found wasn’t encouraging. Those would be executives had, says Etzioni, little interest in concepts of ethics and morality in the boardroom—and their professor was met with blank stares when he urged his students to see business in new and different ways.
Etzioni sees the experience at Harvard as an eye-opening one and says there’s much about business schools that he’d like to change. “A lot of the faculty teaching business are bad news themselves,” Etzioni says. From offering classes that teach students how to legally manipulate contracts, to reinforcing the notion of profit over community interests, Etzioni has seen a lot that’s left him shaking his head. And because of what he’s seen taught in business schools, he’s not surprised by the latest rash of corporate scandals. “In many ways things have got a lot worse at business schools, I suspect,” says Etzioni.
Etzioni is still teaching the sociology of right and wrong and still calling for ethical business leadership. “People with poor motives will always exist.” He says. “Sometimes environments constrain those people and sometimes environments give those people opportunity.” Etzioni says the booming economy of the last decade enabled those individuals with poor motives to get rich before getting in trouble. His hope now: that the cries for reform will provide more fertile soil for his long-standing messages about business ethics.

Television is rapidly becoming the literature of our periods╱.	1. time/times/period
Many of the arguments having╱ used for the study of literature as	2. _______\_______
a school subject are valid for ∧ study of television.	3. ______the______
The National Endowment for the Arts recently released the results of its “Reading at Risk” survey, which described the movement of the American public away from books and literature and toward television and electronic media. According to the survey, “reading is on the decline on every (62) region, within every ethnic group, and at every educational level.”
The day the NEA report released, the U.S. House, in a tie (63) Vote, upheld the government’s right to obtain bookstore and library records under a provision of the USA Patriot Act. The House proposal would have barred the federal government (64) from demand library records, reading lists, book customer lists and other material in terrorism and intelligence investigations.
These two events are completely unrelated to, yet they (65) echo each other in the message they send about the place of books and reading in American culture. At the heart (66) of the NEA survey is the belief in our democratic System depends on leaders who can think critically, analyze (67) texts and discussing books and literature. At the same time, through a provision of the Patriot Act, the leaders of our country are unconsciously sending the message that reading (68) may be connected to desirable activities that might undermine our system of government rather than helping democracy flourish.
Our culture’s decline in reading begin well before the (69) existence of the Patriot Act. During the 1980s’ culture wars, school systems across the country pulled some books from (70) library shelves because its content was deemed by parents and teachers to be inappropriate. Now what started in schools across the country is playing itself out on a nation stage and (71) is possibly having an impact on the reading habits of the American public.

Seven Steps to a More Fulfilling Job
Many people today find themselves in unfulfilling work situations. In fact, one in four workers is dissatisfied with their current job, according to the recent “Plans for 2004” survey. Their career path may be financially rewarding, but it doesn’t meet their emotional, social or creative needs. They’re stuck, unhappy, and have no idea what to do about it, except move to another job.
Mary Lyn Miller, veteran career consultant and founder of the Life and Career Clinic, says that when most people are unhappy about their work, their first thought is to get a different job. Instead, Miller suggests looking at the possibility of a different life. Through her book, 8 Myths of Making a Living, as well as workshops, seminars and personal coaching and consulting, she has helped thousands of dissatisfied workers reassess life and work.
Like the way of Zen, which includes understanding of oneself as one really is, Miller encourages job seekers and those dissatisfied with work or life to examine their beliefs about work and recognize that “in many cases your beliefs are what brought you to where you are today.” You may have been raised to think that women were best at nurturing and caring and, therefore, should be teachers and nurses. So that’s what you did. Or, perhaps you were brought up to believe that you should do what your father did, so you have taken over the family business, or become a dentist “just like dad.” If this sounds familiar, it’s probably time to look at the new possibilities for your future.
Miller developed a 7-step process to help potential job seekers assess their current situation and beliefs, identify their real passion, and start on a journey that allows them to pursue their passion through work.
Step 1: Willingness to do something different.
Breaking the cycle of doing what you have always done is one of the most difficult tasks for job seekers. Many find it difficult to steer away from a career path or make a change, even if it doesn’t feel right. Miller urges job seekers to open their minds to other possibilities beyond what they are currently doing.
Step 2: Commitment to being who you are, not who or what someone wants you to be.
Look at the gifts and talents you have and make a commitment to pursue those things that you love most. If you love the social aspects of your job, but are stuck inside an office or “chained to your desk” most of the time, vow to follow your instinct and investigate alternative careers and work that allow you more time to interact with others. Dawn worked as a manager for a large retail clothing store for several years. Though she had advanced within the company, she felt frustrated and longed to be involved with nature and the outdoors. She decided to go to school nights and weekends to pursue her true passion by earning her master’s degree in forestry. She now works in the biotech forestry division of a major paper company.
Step 3: Self-definition.
Miller suggests that once job seekers know who they are, they need to know how to sell themselves. “In the job market, you are a product. And just like a product, you must know the features and benefits that you have to offer a potential client, or employer.” Examine the skills and knowledge that you have and identify how they can apply to your desired occupation. Your qualities will exhibit to employers why they should hire you over other candidates.
Step 4: Attain a level of self-honoring.
Self-honoring or self-love may seem like an odd step for job hunters, but being able to accept yourself, without judgment, helps eliminate insecurities and will make you more self-assured. By accepting who you are – all your emotions, hopes and dreams, your personality, and your unique way of being – you’ll project more confidence when networking and talking with potential employers. The power of self-honoring can help to break all the falsehoods you were programmed to believe – those that made you feel that you were not good enough, or strong enough, or intelligent enough to do what you truly desire.
Step 5: Vision.
Miller suggests that job seekers develop a vision that embraces the answer to “What do I really want to do?” one should create a solid statement in a dozen or so sentences that describe in detail how they see their life related to work. For instance, the secretary who longs to be an actress describes a life that allows her to express her love of Shakespeare on stage. A real estate agent, attracted to his current job because he loves fixing up old homes, describes buying properties that need a little tender loving care to make them more saleable.
Step 6: Appropriate risk.
Some philosophers believe that the way to enlightenment comes through facing obstacles and difficulties. Once people discover their passion, many are too scared to do anything about it. Instead, they do nothing. With this step, job seekers should assess what they are willing to give up, or risk, in pursuit of their dream. For one working mom, that meant taking night classes to learn new computer-aided design skills, while still earning a salary and keeping her day job. For someone else, it may mean quitting his or her job, taking out a loan and going back to school full time. You’ll move one step closer to your ideal work life if you identify how much risk you are willing to take and the sacrifices you are willing to make.
Step 7: Action.
Some teachers of philosophy describe action in this way, “If one wants to get to the top of a mountain, just sitting at the foot thinking about it will not bring one there. It is by making the effort of climbing up the mountain, step by step, that eventually the summit is reached.” All too often, it is the lack of action that ultimately holds people back from attaining their ideals. Creating a plan and taking it one step at a time can lead to new and different job opportunities. Job-hunting tasks gain added meaning as you sense their importance in your quest for a more meaningful work life. The plan can include researching industries and occupations, talking to people who are in your desired area of work, taking classes, or accepting volunteer work in your targeted field.
Each of these steps will lead you on a journey to a happier and more rewarding work life. After all, it is the journey, not the destination, that is most important.

Part IV Reading Comprehension （Reading in Depth） （25 minutes）
Section A 
Directions:	In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
Google is a world-famous company, with its headquarters in Mountain View, California. It was set up in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998, and inflated (膨胀) with the Internet bubble. Even when everything around it collapsed the company kept on inflating. Google’s search engine is so widespread across the world that search became Google, and google became a verb. The world fell in love with the effective, fascinatingly fast technology.
Google owes much of its success to the brilliance of S. Brin and L. Page, but also to a series of fortunate events. It was Page who, at Stanford in 1996, initiated the academic project that eventually became Google’s search engine. Brin, who had met Page at a student orientation a year earlier, joined the project early on. They were both Ph.D. candidates when they devised the search engine which was better than the rest and, without any marketing, spread by word of mouth from early adopters to, eventually, your grandmother.
Their breakthrough, simply put, was that when their search engine crawled the Web, it did more than just look for word matches; it also tallied (统计) and ranked a host of other critical factors like how websites link to one another. That delivered far better results than anything else. Brin and Page meant to name their creation Googol (the mathematical term for the number 1 followed by 100 zeroes), but someone misspelled the word so it stuck as Google. They raised money from prescient (有先见之明的) professors and venture capitalists, and moved off campus to turn Google into a business. Perhaps their biggest stroke of luck came early on when they tried to sell their technology to other search engines, but no one met their price, and they built it up on their own.
The next breakthrough came in 2000, when Google figured out how to make money with its invention. It had lots of users, but almost no one was paying. The solution turned out to be advertising, and it’s not an exaggeration to say that Google is now essentially an advertising company, given that that’s the source of nearly all its revenue. Today it is a giant advertising company, worth $100 billion.

Section B
Directions:	There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
You hear the refrain all the time: the U.S. economy looks good statistically, but it doesn’t feel good. Why doesn’t ever-greater wealth promote ever-greater happiness? It is a question that dates at least to the appearance in 1958 of The Affluent (富裕的) Society by John Kenneth Galbraith, who died recently at 97.
The Affluent Society is a modern classic because it helped define a new moment in the human condition. For most of history, “hunger, sickness, and cold” threatened nearly everyone, Galbraith wrote. “Poverty was found everywhere in that world. Obviously it is not of ours.” After World War II, the dread of another Great Depression gave way to an economic boom. In the 1930s unemployment had averaged 18.2 percent; in the 1950s it was 4.5 percent.
To Galbraith, materialism had gone mad and would breed discontent. Through advertising, companies conditioned consumers to buy things they didn’t really want or need. Because so much spending was artificial, it would be unfulfilling. Meanwhile, government spending that would make everyone better off was being cut down because people instinctively—and wrongly—labeled government only as “a necessary evil.”
It’s often said that only the rich are getting ahead; everyone else is standing still or falling behind. Well, there are many undeserving rich—overpaid chief executives, for instance. But over any meaningful period, most people’s incomes are increasing. From 1995 to 2004, inflation-adjusted average family income rose 14.3 percent, to $43,200. People feel “squeezed” because their rising incomes often don’t satisfy their rising wants—for bigger homes, more health care, more education, faster Internet connections.
The other great frustration is that it has not eliminated insecurity. People regard job stability as part of their standard of living. As corporate layoffs increased, that part has eroded. More workers fear they’ve become “the disposable American,” as Louis Uchitelle puts it in his book by the same name.
Because so much previous suffering and social conflict stemmed from poverty, the arrival of widespread affluence suggested utopian (乌托邦式的) possibilities. Up to a point, affluence succeeds. There is much less physical misery than before. People are better off. Unfortunately, affluence also creates new complaints and contradictions.
Advanced societies need economic growth to satisfy the multiplying wants of their citizens. But the quest for growth lets loose new anxieties and economic conflicts that disturb the social order. Affluence liberates the individual, promising that everyone can choose a unique way to self-fulfillment. But the promise is so extravagant that it predestines many disappointments and sometimes inspires choices that have anti-social consequences, including family breakdown and obesity (肥胖症). Statistical indicators of happiness have not risen with incomes.
Should we be surprised? Not really. We’ve simply reaffirmed an old truth: the pursuit of affluence does not always end with happiness.
52.What question does John Kenneth Galbraith raise in his book The Affluent Society?
	A) Why statistics don’t tell the truth about the economy.
	B) Why affluence doesn’t guarantee happiness.
	C) How happiness can be promoted today.
	D) What lies behind an economic boom.（B）
53.According to Galbraith, people feel discontented because ________.
	A) public spending hasn’t been cut down as expected
	B) the government has proved to be a necessary evil
	C) they are in fear of another Great Depression
	D) materialism has run wild in modern society（D）
54.Why do people feel squeezed when their average income rises considerably?
	A) Their material pursuits have gone far ahead of their earnings.
	B) Their purchasing power has dropped markedly with inflation.
	C) The distribution of wealth is uneven between the rich and the poor.
	D) Health care and educational costs have somehow gone out of control.（A）
55.What does Louis Uchitelle mean by “the disposable American” (Line 3, Para. 5)?
	A) Those who see job stability as part of their living standard.
	B) People full of utopian ideas resulting from affluence.
	C) People who have little say in American politics.
	D) Workers who no longer have secure jobs.（D）
56.What has affluence brought to American society?
	A) Renewed economic security.				B) A sense of self-fulfillment.
	C) New conflicts and complaints.			D) Misery and anti-social behavior.（C）
Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
The use of deferential (敬重的) language is symbolic of the Confucian ideal of the woman, which dominates conservative gender norms in Japan. This ideal presents a woman who withdraws quietly to the background, subordinating her life and needs to those of her family and its male head. She is a dutiful daughter, wife, and mother, master of the domestic arts. The typical refined Japanese woman excels in modesty and delicacy; she “treads softly (谨言慎行)in the world,” elevating feminine beauty and grace to an art form.
Nowadays, it is commonly observed that young women are not conforming to the feminine linguistic (语言的) ideal. They are using fewer of the very deferential “women’s” forms, and even using the few strong forms that are known as “men’s.” This, of course, attracts considerable attention and has led to an outcry in the Japanese media against the defeminization of women’s language. Indeed, we didn’t hear about “men’s language” until people began to respond to girls’ appropriation of forms normally reserved for boys and men. There is considerable sentiment about the “corruption” of women’s language—which of course is viewed as part of the loss of feminine ideals and morality—and this sentiment is crystallized by nationwide opinion polls that are regularly carried out by the media.
Yoshiko Matsumoto has argued that young women probably never used as many of the highly deferential forms as older women. This highly polite style is no doubt something that young women have been expected to “grow into”—after all, it is a sign not simply of femininity, but of maturity and refinement, and its use could be taken to indicate a change in the nature of one’s social relations as well. One might well imagine little girls using exceedingly polite forms when playing house or imitating older women—in a fashion analogous to little girls’ use of a high-pitched voice to do “teacher talk” or “mother talk” in role play.
The fact that young Japanese women are using less deferential language is a sure sign of change—of social change and of linguistic change. But it is most certainly not a sign of the “masculinization” of girls. In some instances, it may be a sign that girls are making the same claim to authority as boys and men, but that is very different from saying that they are trying to be “masculine.” Katsue Reynolds has argued that girls nowadays are using more assertive language strategies in order to be able to compete with boys in schools and out. Social change also brings not simply different positions for women and girls, but different relations to life stages, and adolescent girls are participating in new subcultural forms. Thus what may, to an older speaker, seem like “masculine” speech may seem to an adolescent like “liberated” or “hip” speech.
57.The first paragraph describes in detail ________.
	A) the standards set for contemporary Japanese women
	B) the Confucian influence on gender norms in Japan
	C) the stereotyped role of women in Japanese families
	D) the norms for traditional Japanese women to follow（B）
58.What change has been observed in today’s young Japanese women?
	A) They pay less attention to their linguistic behavior.
	B) The use fewer of the deferential linguistic forms.
	C) They confuse male and female forms of language.
	D) They employ very strong linguistic expressions.（B）
59.How do some people react to women’s appropriation of men’s language forms as reported in the Japanese media?
	A) They call for a campaign to stop the defeminization.
	B) They see it as an expression of women’s sentiment.
	C) They accept it as a modern trend.
	D) They express strong disapproval.（D）
60.According to Yoshiko Matsumoto, the linguistic behavior observed in today’s young women ________.
	A) may lead to changes in social relations
	B) has been true of all past generations
	C) is viewed as a sign of their maturity
	D) is a result of rapid social progress（A）
61.The author believes that the use of assertive language by young Japanese women is ________.
	A) a sure sign of their defeminization and maturation
	B) an indication of their defiance against social change
	C) one of their strategies to compete in a male-dominated society
	D) an inevitable trend of linguistic development in Japan today（C）

2007年6月大学英语六级(CET-6)参考答案

Part I Writing (30 minutes)
写作范文
Should One Expect a Reward When Doing a Good Deed?
　　A great many people presume upon a reward when doing a good deed. First and foremost, there is a natural tendency to equate doing good deeds with a certain amount of reward, and reward with a certain amount of money. What is more, they maintain that since the basis of contemporary society is money, one of the major means of earning money is getting reward by doing good deeds.
　　On the contrary, the vast majority of people assume that doing a good deed should be based on people’s personal consciousness. Hence, doing a good deed is fulfilling itself and reward is of minimal significance. Numerous examples can be given, but this will suffice. Mr. Leifeng lived a simple life dedicated to doing good deeds without expecting any reward and helping people from all walks of life, yet he was remembered as one of the most successful hero of our time.
　　Generally speaking, it is my view that we should not expect a reward when doing a good deed. We do this for enjoyment, self-fulfillment and spiritual enhancement, not for the purpose of reward.
参考译文
　　很多人做好事期望得到回报。首先，人们常常自然而然地把做好事等同于一定的回报，又把回报等同于一定的金钱。其次，他们认为当今社会以金钱为基础，而挣钱的主要途径之一就是通过做好事获得回报。
　　反之，大多数人认为做好事应以个人觉悟为基础。因此，做好事本身就能满足个人需要，回报则可有可无。可以给出无数例子，这个就足够了。雷锋生活简朴，一生致力于做好事不计任何回报，同时帮助各行各业的人们，然而他被公认为我们时代最成功的楷模。
　　总之，我认为我们应该做好事不图回报。做好事本身就是一种享受、自我实现和精神升华，不是为了回报。

答案与解析：
【快速阅读·指点迷津】
　　考生应该先看文章后的题目，分析定位词，并用笔标出以加深印象；把文章通读一遍，注意每段的中心句或中心思想，留心题目当中标出的信息，但不要在阅读过程中停下来去考虑单词、词组或句子的意思，懂不懂都要一律跳过；在做题时，要注意对比题目和文章当中相应信息在表述方式上的不同，要特别注意两者在用词上的区别--考的往往就是这个词。
【试题精讲】
1．【答案】N
【解析】考生首先要根据定位词 "Plans for 2004" 找到文章的第1段第2句。 "In fact, one in four workers is dissatisfied with their current job, according to the recent Plans for 2004 survey." 题干中的most与原文one in four显然不符，故答案为N。
2．【答案】Y
【解析】题目中的定位词Mary Lyn Miller 可以在原文第2段首句找到。"Mary Lyn Miller, veteran career consultant and founder of the Life and Career Clinic..." 题目中的advise与原文consultant对应，故答案为Y。
3．【答案】NG
【解析】根据定位词Mary Lyn Miller找到文章第2段。首句提到 "...says that when most people are unhappy about their work..."和尾句的 "...she has helped thousands of dissatisfied workers reassess life and work."均未涉及她本人对自己工作的感想，故答案为NG。
4．【答案】Y
【解析】考生可根据题目中的定位词many people find it difficult找到文章Step 1 Willingness to do something different的第2句。 "Many find it difficult to steer away from a career path make a change..." 题目中以change their career path与原文的steer away from a career path or make a change意义吻合，故答案为Y。
5．【答案】those things that they love most
【解析】题目中的定位词commit和pursuit可以在Step 2 Commitment to being who you are, not who or what someone wants you to be 的第1句找到: "...and make a commitment to pursue those things that you love most." 介词of后应填名词形式，答案为those things that they love most，在这里考生注意的是把文中的人称代词you改为they.
6．【答案】products
【解析】定位词是sell themselves，考生可在原文Step 3 Self-definition 的开头部分找到: "...they need to know how sell themselves. 'In the job market, you are a product.'" 而题目中的In the job market与原文一致，故答案为products.
7．【答案】more confidence
【解析】根据定位词self-honoring or self-love和potential employers可找到原文Step 4 Attain a level of self-honoring的第2句。"By accepting who you are-your emotions, hopes and dreams, your personality, and your unique way of being-you'll project more confidence when networking and talking with potential employers." 题目中的during an interview with potential employers 和 when networking and talking with potential employers一致，show与project对应，故答案为more confidence.
8．【答案】What do I really want to do
【解析】考生可根据定位词develop a vision找到原文Step 5 Vision的首句。 Miller suggests that job seekers develop a vision that embraces the answer to "What do I really want to do?" 题目中的answers the question 与原文embraces the answer to正好对应，故答案为What do I really want to do.
9．【答案】give up or risk/take risks and make sacrifices
【解析】定位词pursue their dreams 和unwilling to可以帮助考生迅速找到原文Step 6 Appropriate risk的第4句，"...job seekers should assess what they are willing to give up, or risk, in pursuit of their dream." 答案显然为give up or risk。考生也可从尾句找到答案:"...if you identify how much risk you are willing to take and the sacrifices you are wiling to make."
10.【答案】the lack of action
【解析】根据定位词 holds people back from考生可找到文章Step 7 Action的第3句。 "All too often, it is the lack of action that ultimately holds people back from attaining their ideas." 此句为强调句型，与题目意思完全一致，强调的部分the lack of action即为空白部分应填的答案。
【全文精译】
　找到满意工作的七步法
　　现在很多人发现自己的工作环境不尽如人意。事实上，据近期的"2004计划"调查表明，四个就业人员中就有一个对目前的工作不满。他们可能收入丰厚，但不能实现自身的情感、社会和创造需求。他们进退两难，闷闷不乐，除了另谋职业又无计可施。
　　Mary Lyn Miller是位资深职业顾问，她创立了"生活和职业诊所"。她说，大多数人对工作不满时，第一念头是换工作。相反，Miller却建议尝试另外一种生活态度。在她的培训班、研讨会、私人辅导和《谋生的8大秘诀》一书中，她已经帮助成千上万的人重新审视他们的生活和工作。
　　像修禅要参悟真我一样，Miller鼓励求职者和不满现实者要反省他们的工作信念，从而认识到"在很多情况下，正是这些信念使他们变成了今天这个样子"。你们可能从小受到的教育是女性擅长教育和照顾人，因此应该当教师和护士。这正是你的选择。或许，你可能从小被灌输了这样的思想，认为应该子承父业，所以你继承家业或成为"像父亲那样的"牙医。如果你听来耳熟，可能该是时候重新审视自己未来的发展方向了。
　　Miller创立了七步法来帮助求职者评估他们的现状和信念，确认兴趣所在，踏上寻求工作成就兴趣之旅。

步骤一：愿意尝试新事物
　　打破传统的工作圈对求职者来说是最难的。很多人发现即使感觉不好，也很难偏离原先的职业轨道或是做出改变。Miller敦促求职者要开阔眼界，谋求现供职之外的可能性。
步骤二：坚持自我，不要屈从于他人意愿
　　看清自己的天赋，下定决心追寻自己的理想。如果你热爱社交，可是大部分时间被困于办公室或"绑在办公桌旁"，那就发誓听从自己的内心需要，寻求其他能提供更多时间与人交流的职业。Dawn在一家大型服装店做了几年的经理秘书，尽管得到了提升，却一直郁郁寡欢，渴望在大自然里从事室外工作。于是她决定晚上和周末上学，拿到林业硕士学位，实现自己真正的理想。她目前在一家大型造纸公司的生物技术森林部门工作。
步骤三：自我定义
　　Miller 建议求职者一旦了解了自己，就要弄清楚如何推销自己。"在就业市场，你是产品。和产品一样，你必须知道你能给潜在客户带来哪些特色和利益。"检查自己的技能和知识，确定如何将之应用于你渴望的职业。你的才能会向你的老板展示为何雇佣你而不是别人。
步骤四：在一定程度上肯定自我
　　自我肯定和自爱对求职者来说可能有些奇怪，但能够不假思索地肯定自己有助于消除不安全感，从而增强自信心。接受自己--你所有的情感、希望、梦想、个性和独特的生活方式--你会在和未来的雇主沟通或交流时表现得更加自信。自我肯定的力量可以打破你对自我认识的误区--你不够好，不够强，不够聪明做自己真正想做的事情。
步骤五：远见卓识
　　Miller建议求职者在对待"我真正想做什么"这个问题时总是要培养远见卓识。他们应该用十几个句子写一段话，详细地描述生活和工作如何关联的。比如说，想当演员的秘书会描述能让她在舞台上表达对莎士比亚的热爱的生活。一个房地产代理商因为喜欢修理旧房子而被吸引做目前的工作，他描述了房产的购买过程，这些房产只需一些温柔的呵护就可以更容易卖掉。
步骤六：适当的风险
　　一些哲学家认为智慧之旅始自直面障碍和困难。人们一旦发现了自己的爱好，多数人会因为恐惧而止步不前。相反，他们什么也不做。在这一步上，求职者应该清楚在追寻梦想时他们愿意放弃什么，或冒怎样的风险。对于一位有工作的母亲来说，那就意味着在白天上班挣钱的同时去上夜校学习新的计算机辅助设计方面的技能。对于其他人来说，可能意味着要辞掉工作，申请贷款，全职学习。如果你确定自己愿意承担的风险和做出的牺牲，你也就离你理想中的工作生活又近了一步。
步骤七：行动
　　一些哲学教师这样描述行动："如果一个人想登上峰项，仅仅坐在山脚空想是无用的。正是一步步努力攀登才能最终到达山巅。"通常，往往是缺乏行动才使人们在实现理想时举步不前。制定计划，然后按部就班地实施，能够带来新的工作机遇。在寻找更有意义的工作生活中，若能意识到求职中各项任务的重要性，那么，这会有额外的意义。求职计划可以包括研究各行各业，和你渴望的领域工作的人谈话，听课，或者接受你目标领域的志愿工作。
每一步都会引领你走向更快乐、更有价值感的工作生活之旅。毕竟，是旅程，不是终点，这才是最重要的。

W: Very busy. 【19】I had a lot of meetings. So, of course, I didn't have much time to see New York.
M: What a pity. Actually I have a trip there myself next week.
W: Do you? Then take my advice, do the well-being in the air program. It really works.
M: Oh, I read about that in a magazine. You say it works?
W: Yes. 【20】I did the program on the flight to the States. And when I arrived in New York, I didn't have any problem. No jet leg at all. On the way back, I didn't do it, and I felt terrible.
M: You are joking.
W: Not at all. It really made a lot of difference.
M: Hmm...【21】So, what did you do?
W: Well, I didn't drink any alcohol or coffee, and I didn't eat any meat or rich food. I drink a lot of water and fruit juice, and I eat the meals on the well-being menu. They are lighter. They have fish, vegetables and noodles, for example. And I did some of the exercises in the program.
M: Exercises? On a plane?
W: Yes. I didn't do many, of course. There isn't much space on the plane.
M: 【22】How many passengers did the exercises?
W: Not many.
M: And how much champagne did they drink?

M: So, basically, it's a choice. Mineral water and exercises or champagne and jet lag.
W: That's right. It's a difficult choice.
19.
【答案解析】 
B)动词不定式表示目的。听力一开始女士就讲自己有很多会议。考生听到听力原文要做标记，以加强记忆。
20.
【答案解析】 
D)四个选项表达了某件事带来的好处，因而考生在听力中要特别注意他们讨论的话题，女士建议男士做the well-being，然后以此展开讨论，考生不用把重点放在理解well-being上，而是注意他们的讨论。女士说，在去美国的飞机上她做了well-being，到达美国之后，没有任何问题。所以它可以减轻坐飞机带来的不适。
21.
【答案解析】
D)选项告诉考生要注意对话中出现的饮食细节。女士说，她不喝酒，不吃肉或其他油腻的食物。这里，考生要注意西方饮食不把鱼肉归在肉类中，同时rich在饮食中为"油腻的"，light表示"清淡的"。

【听力短文·指点迷津】
听力段落信息比较集中，考生应学会通过选项来猜测段落大意，判断听力重点，用自己的方式做笔记，强化自己的记忆。
Passage One
【听力原文】
The New Year always brings with it a cultural tradition of new possibilities. 【26】We see it as a chance for renewal. We begin to dream of new possible selves. We design our ideal self or an image that is quite different from what we are now. For some of us, we roll that dreamy film in our heads just because it is the beginning of the New Year, but we are serious about making changes. We just make some half heart resolution and it evaporates after a week or two. The experience makes us less successful and leads us to discount ability to change in the future. It's not the changes impossible but it won't last unless our resolutions are supported with plans for implementation. 【27】We have to make our intensions manageable by detailing the specific steps that will carry us to our goal. Say your goal is to lose weight by dieting and cutting off sweets. But one night you just have to have a cookie. And you know there is a bag of your favorites in the cupboard. You want one, you eat two, you check the bag and find out that you've just shot 132 calories. You say to yourself, "What the hell. I'll polish off the whole bag." Then you begin to draw all kinds of unpleasant conclusions about yourself. To protect your sense of yourself, you begin to discount the goal. You may think, "Well, dieting wasn't that important to me and I wouldn't make it anyhow." 【28】So you'll abandon the goal and return to your bad habits.
26.
【答案解析】
A)这篇听力开篇就谈到新年，对考生来讲相对比较简单，因为符合中国人的习惯。新年新决定，但很多时候人们会半途而废。随后说我们把新年当做自我更新的机会，我们做与现在的我们完全不一样的计划安排。
27.
【答案解析】
D)by+doing表示方式方法。在26题的基础上，考生可以推测问题有可能是人们通过什么方式来实现自己给自已设计的目标。段落中间为了实现目标，我们应该列出具体步骤并在生活中践行。
28.
【答案解析】
D)to show, to remind, to illustrate等词的不定式一般表示目的。段落最后举了个戒掉糖果来减肥的例子。最后说人们放弃了自己的目标，又回到自己的坏习惯中。这些做法也出现在我们的现实生活中，很容易理解。
Passage Two
【听力原文】
25 years ago, Ray Anderson, a single parent with a one-year-old son, witnessed a terrible accident which took place when the driver of a truck ran a red light and collided with the car of Sandra Drinkens. 【29】The impact of the collision killed Sandra instantly, but her three-month-old daughter was left trapped in the burning car. While others looked on in horror, 【30】Anderson jumped out of his vehicle and crawled into the car through the shattered rear window to try to free the infant. Seconds later, the car was enclosed in flames, but to everyone's amazement, Anderson was able to pull the baby to safety. While the baby was all right, Anderson was seriously injured. Two days later, he died. But his heroic act was published widely in the media. His son was soon adopted by relatives. The most remarkable part of this story unfolded only last week. Karen and her boyfriend Michael were looking through some old boxes when they came across some old newspaper clippings. "This is me when I was a new born baby. I was rescued from a burning car but my mother died in the accident," explained Karen. Although Michael knew Karen's mother had died years earlier, he never fully understood the circumstances until he skimmed over the news paper article. To Karen's surprise, Michael was absorbed in the details of the accident and 【31】he began to cry uncontrollably. Then he revealed that the man that pulled Karen from the flames was the father he never knew. The two embraced and shed many tears, recounting stories told to them about their parents.
29.
【答案解析】
C)通看选项可以判断很有可能是篇记叙文，过去时态表明发生在过去的事情。听力开始讲在事故中Sandra当场死亡，而她三个月的女儿还在车中。Karen是个女姓名，考生可以推测是女儿的名字，听力最后也可确认推测是正确的。
30.
【答案解析】
B)看过选项，考生应该把听力注意力集中在一位男性的所作所为。Sandra当场死亡，Anderson去救婴儿，受重伤，两天后死亡。
31.
【答案解析】
A)听力一开始说到Anderson是个单身父亲，小男孩一岁多。考生可以猜测Michael可能是这个男孩的名字。听力最后，Michael才意识到那位英雄是自己从未谋面的父亲。
Passage Three
【听力原文】
Americans suffer from an overdose of work. Regardless of who they are or what they do, Americans spend more time at work than at any time since World War II. In 1950, the US had fewer working hours than any other industrialized country. 【32】Today, it exceeds any country but Japan, where industrial employees log 2,155 hours a year, compared with 1,951 in the US, and 1,603 in the former West Germany. Between 1969 and 1989, employed Americans added an average of 138 hours to their yearly work schedules. 【33】The workweek has remained at about 40 hours, but people are working more weeks each year. Specifically paid time-off holidays, vacations, sick leave shrank by 50 % in the 1980s. 【34】As corporations have experienced stiff competition and slower growth productivity, they have pressed employees to work longer. Cost cutting lay-offs in the 1980s reduced the professional and managerial ranks, leaving fewer people to get the job done. In lower paid occupations where wages have been reduced, workers have added hours in overtime or extra jobs to preserve their living standards. The government estimates that more than 7 million people hold a second job. 【35】 For the first time, large numbers of people say they want to cut back on working hours even if it means earning less money. But most employers are unwilling to let them do so. The government, which has stepped back from its traditional role as a regulator of work time should take steps to make shorter hours possible.
32.
【答案解析】
B)四个国家名，考生应注意听力的话题。开篇说道美国人工作超时，考生可断定本段文章讨论超时工作。接着，听力中说它超过了除了日本的其他任何国家，"它"在这里指代美国。考生可简单按照工作时间从多到少将提到的国家排序。
33.
【答案解析】
D)by+doing表示方式方法。听力主要讨论超时工作，考生可推测此题是讨论如何做到这一点的。四个选项都是合理的方法，所以考生要注意听力细节，哪一个是文章提到的。听力中间讲人们每年工作的周数增多了，具体的讲他们的假期降了50%，考生注意shrink的理解，"缩减"。
34.
【答案解析】
A)to do不定式一般表目的，前后相互联系，考生要关注超时工作的目的和原因。中间讲公司经历了残酷的竞争，生产力低下，所以他们强迫工人超时工作。反言之，超时工作的目的是为了与竞争抗衡，提高生产力。
35.
【答案解析】
C)四个选项表明采取的措施。听力最后，人们想减少工作时间，哪怕这意味着自己的收入降低了。cut back on意为"减少"。
Section C
【复合式听写·指点迷津】
考生要通读全篇，理解大意，这样可以有效的利用上下文来确认自己听到的单词和句子。单词的填写要根据英语语法使用合适的形式，句子的填写要把握大意，符合英语句型。
36. 【答案】licensed
【解析】be动词后或加to do表示将来，或加动词的过去分词表被动。根据前文，作为护士，我们主要干什么呢？license表示"授权"，根据句义，此处应为被动，护士被授予某种权利。
37. 【答案】obligation
【解析】形容词的后面应该用名词。第一句人们误认为护士是和医生紧密联系在一起的，实际上，护士对医生没有任何法律或道德上的义务。
38. 【答案】assess
【解析】通观上下文，此句是个排比句，同一个主语，动词排列。根据发音，assess，注意拼写中两个s。
39. 【答案】coordinate
【解析】和38空相似，因为排比此处需要一个动词。考生可以记忆词缀来扩大词汇量，co是个前缀，表示"一起"，拼写中应注意形式。
40. 【答案】circumstance
【解析】any后应该是个名词，而且可以和介词in搭配，in any circumstance，表示在任何情况下，是个比较常用的短语。
41. 【答案】inappropriate
【解析】or的后面用到unsafe，这说明前面的词汇应该是和unsafe同义，应该是个表示否定的单词。考生应根据上下文添加表示否定的弱读前缀in。
42. 【答案】responsibility
【解析】冠词a的后面应该用名词。上半句说，如果我们认为不安全或不合适，在法律上我们有责任质疑。
43. 【答案】prime
【解析】在名词的前面应该用形容词进行修饰。考生应简化句子结构，判断句子主语为stress，压力是最主要的原因。
44. 【答案】It is sometimes required that we work overtime, and that we change shifts four or five times a month
【解析】上文讲到精神和身体上的压力是最主要的原因。下文讲到这扰乱我们的日常生活等等不好的方面，句子用that做主语，根据语法，that指代空白处的句子。听力关键词为overtime，change shifts(换班)，其语法重点是虚拟语气的使用。It is required后面的that从句用虚拟语气，其表现形式为should do，或did(过去式)。
45. 【答案】Most hospitals are now staffed by new graduates, as experienced nurses finally give up trying to change the system
【解析】上文讲因为这些原因护理质量受到了严重影响。而医院的做法呢？听力关键词为staffed, experienced，其中重点(也是难点)是staff作为动词的含义，"充当职员"，考生可用employ或use等同义词来替换。
46. 【答案】they will find that most critical hospital care will be provided by new, inexperienced, and sometimes inadequately trained nurses
【解析】前文讲消费者还没有感觉到明显的影响，但这种趋势如果持续下去，结果如何呢？听力关键词为critical, inexperienced, inadequately，其中后两个前文曾经出现过，不应该成为听力难点。

　　Google公司举世闻名，总部在加利福尼亚的山景城。1998年建立在一家硅谷的车库里，随着网络泡沫而急剧增长。即使周围的公司都倒闭了，它却一直扩大。Google的搜索引擎在全世界如此普及，结果搜索变成了Google，google成了动词。全世界都迷上了这个有效的、飞速的技术。
　　【47】Google的成功主要取决于S. Brin和L. Page的才华，同时也来源于一系列幸运的事情。【48】是Page1996在斯坦福大学的学术项目最终成为Google的搜索引擎。Brin在早一年的新生指南中认识了Page，随后较早加入了该项目。设计出最佳搜索引擎时他们是博士研究生；【49】其搜索引擎没有市场推广，大家口口相传，从早期的使用者传到了祖母那里。
　　简单说，其突破在于，他们的搜索引擎在网络搜索时不仅仅寻找单词匹配，还对很多其他关键因素统计、排序，如考虑网站如何链接。这搜索结果比其他搜索方式所得结果好得多。Brin和Page本打算将其命名为Googol(在数学上代表10的100次方)，但有人错拼单词，最终成了google。他们从有先见之明的教授和风险投资家那里筹集到资金，搬出校园把Google办成了企业。对他们来说，最幸运的事情可能是早期他们想把技术卖给其他搜索引擎却【50】没有人愿意出他们期待的价钱，因此他们建立了自己的公司。
另一个突破是2000年的Google意识到如何利用发明赚钱。使用的人很多，但付费的人很少。后来解决方法是广告，【51】广告几乎是所有收入来源，所以说Google本质上是广告公司一点都不为过。如今它是价值1000亿美元的广告公司巨头。
47.【答案】The brilliance of S. Brin and L. Page
【解析】考生根据问题可把答案直接定位在第二段的第一句话。问题提问原因，可以直接用名词短语作答，注意首字母要大写。
48.【答案】the academic project
【解析】文章第二段的第二句话讲到Page开始写的学术项目最终成为Google的搜索引擎。originate from意为"源，来源"，后面直接加名词。
49.【答案】By word of mouth
【解析】问题提问的是方式，第二段的最后一句说不是通过市场，而是口头相传。答案中注意by不能省略，在这里表示方式。
50.【答案】meet their price
【解析】第三段的最后一句讲到他们建立自己公司的原因，原句用的是过去式，但在答案中，would后用动词原形。
51.【答案】advertising
【解析】根据revenue可定位到文章的最后两句，也是Google的另一个突破，通过广告来赚钱，介词from的后面用动词的ing形式。

考生要把握文章大意，同时注意细节的推敲和辨析，正确理解文章的隐含之义。
Passage One
【全文精译】
　　你一直听人们重复：从数据上看，美国经济很好，不过感觉却不好。【52】为什么日益增长的财富不能让人感觉日益幸福呢？这个问题至少可以追溯到1958年的《富裕社会》一书，作者John Kenneth Galbraith最近去世了，享年97岁。
　　《富裕社会》是一部现代经典著作，帮助定义了一种崭新的人类生存状态。Galbraith写道，人类历史上绝大多数时期"饥饿、疾病和寒冷"几乎威胁着所有人，"在那里，贫穷无处不在。很明显我们的世界并非这样。"二次世界大战后，经济繁荣取代了对另一场大萧条的恐慌。20世纪30年代，平均失业率高达18.2%，50年代则是4.5%。
　　【53】在Galbraith看来，物质主义太盛行，会导致很多不满。通过广告，公司迫使顾客买他们并不想要或不需要的东西。这些都是人为的，并不能使人有满足感。同时，人们本能地或错误地认为政府是"必要之恶"，因而本来能让人们更加富裕的政府花费却被削减了。
　　人们常说只有富人在进步，而其他人保持原样或落后。确实很多富人不配给那么多钱--如薪水过高的主管人员。不过任何一段较长的时间后，大部分人的收入会提高。从1995年到2004年，除却通胀因素，家庭平均收入提高了14.3%，达到了43200美元。【54】人们感觉"财政困难"，因为增长的收入常常不能满足越来越高的需求--房子更大、医疗更完备、教育更优质、网络连接更快捷。
　　另外让他们非常失望的是富裕并没有消除不安全感。【55】人们把工作稳定性当做生活水平的一部分。公司解雇人员在增加，削弱了工作的稳定性。更多工人担心他们成为Louis Uchitelle所称的"可随意丢弃的美国人"，他的一本书以此命名。
　　以前那么多苦难和社会冲突都根源于贫穷，所以现在的普遍富裕带来了乌托邦式的可能性。某种程度上，富裕成功了。现在身体遭受的痛苦比以前少得多，人们更富裕了。不幸的是，富裕也导致了新的抱怨和矛盾。
　　先进社会需要经济增长满足公民日益增长的需要。【56】但寻求增长会带来新的焦虑和经济冲突，这些将扰乱社会秩序。富裕解放了个人，允诺了寻求自我实现的独特道路。不过允诺过高了，它注定了会带来失望，有时会刺激人们选择反社会，包括家庭破裂和肥胖症等。幸福指数并没有随着收入增加而提高。

我们应该吃惊吗？并不。我们只是再次证实了一个古老的真理：对富裕的追求并不总意味着幸福。
文章主题：文章主要讨论了追求富裕和获得幸福感之间的关系。虽然文章中出现了一些比较难理解的短语和句子，但此话题并不陌生，对考生来讲容易把握文章主要意思。
52.【答案解析】B)本题是个细节题，可定位在文章的第一段，这个问题可追溯到1958年这本书，"这个问题"往回指前面的问句，为什么日益增多的财富无法满足更大的幸福感。
53.【答案解析】D)本题也是细节题，考生需要特别关注细节。根据问题，答案可能出现在第三段。第一句中说，物质主义太盛行，将滋生不满。go mad在本句话中的意思是"盛行"，是run wild的同义短语。
54.【答案解析】A)本题也是细节题。第四段的最后一句，人们感觉"财政紧张"，因为增长的收入满足不了越来越多的需求，也就是说，物质追求超出了他们的收入。
55.【答案解析】D)这个短语出现在文章的第五段。对它的理解要结合前面的两句话，人们把工作稳定当做生活水平的一部分，而被解雇的人越多，这种工作安全感也就削弱了。这些"被遗弃的美国人"指对工作没有安全感的工人。
56.【答案解析】C)本题也是个细节题。根据题干可将答案定位在文章的第七段，本段第二句说追求富裕可能带来新的忧虑和经济冲突，同义表达为C。

　　【57】使用敬语是儒家理想女性的象征，它主宰着日本保守的性别规范。依此，女性应安静地退到不为人注意的地方，生活和需要服从于家庭和男性家长的生活和需要。她是顺从的女儿，贤妻良母，干家务活的能手。有教养的日本妇女非常谦和端庄；她在世界上谨言慎行，把女性美丽和优雅提升为艺术形式。
　　如今，经常可以看到年轻女性没有遵守女性的语言规范。【58】她们很少使用恭顺的"女性"用语，却使用为数不多的强势的"男性"用语。【59】这当然吸引了大量关注，日本媒体强烈抗议女性语言的"去女性化"。事实上，人们回应了女孩子借用男孩和男人使用的语言之后，我们才听说"男性语言"。女性语言的"堕落"(被看作是女性理想和女性道德沦丧的一部分)激起了义愤，媒体定期主持的全国性民意调查明确了这种情绪。
　　Yoshiko Mastumoto指出，年轻女性可能从未使用过老一辈女性使用的高级别敬语。毫无疑问，人们期望年轻女性"长大后学会使用"这种极其礼貌的语言，【60】它不仅仅是女性的象征，还是成熟和教养的象征，而且这种语言使用标志着社会关系性质的变化。完全可以想象小姑娘在玩过家家或模仿年长女性时使用非常礼貌的敬语，类似于小姑娘扮演老师或妈妈时说话的尖腔调。
　　年轻日本女性较少使用敬语，这可能代表某种变化，社会的和语言的。但它肯定不表示女孩的"男性化"。有时候，或许意味女性想获得和男孩、男人一样的权威，不过和"男性化"差别很大。【61】Katsue Reynolds曾指出，如今为了能在校内外和男孩竞争，女孩使用更为自信的语言策略。社会变化不仅仅为女人和女孩带来不同的社会地位，还为不同的人生阶段带来不同的人际关系；青春期少女在参与新的亚文化形式。因此，年长的说话者听起来好像"男性化"的语言，在青少年看来可能就是"被解放了的"或"非常时髦的"语言。
文章主题：语言的变化有可能暗示一定的社会变化，语言和社会是密不可分的。本篇文章用日本女性使用的敬语为例，说明了语言变化的种种。
57.【答案解析】B)本题是主旨题。概括总结第一段的意思。考生要学会找主题句，文章第一段的第一句说儒家关于女性的理想统治着日本严格的性别规范。
58.【答案解析】B)本题是细节题。根据题干可将答案定位在文章的第二段。开头写道，她们不遵守女性语言规则，很少使用恭顺的语言表达。考生无需知道deferential的含义，但要定位准确。
59.【答案解析】D)本题是细节题，根据题干可将答案定位在第二段。这种现象引起了关注，日本媒体也抗议女性语言的去女性化。against作为介词，表示反对，不赞成，和disapproval是同义的。
60.【答案解析】D)本题是推理题，考生需要通过逻辑分析来达到合理的结论。文章的第三段谈到这个问题，Yoshiko Matsumoto依此说，年轻女性不使用老一辈非常礼貌的语言，接着说高度礼貌的语言不仅仅是女性象征，也是成熟和优雅的象征，还暗示了社会关系的变化。即，当这些语言代表的复杂的社会关系不存在的话，表现这种关系的语言也要随之改变，不能一成不变。现代女性不使用高级敬语是社会快速发展的结果。
61.【答案解析】C)本题是细节题。文章第四段中间讲了现代女孩子为什么要使用更为自信的语言， 为了和男孩子竞争她们所使用的语言策略。

Part V  Cloze
短文大意：本文对2006年新奥尔良飓风造成的灾难进行了评论，作者认为：由于人类对自然灾害认识不足，因而面临灾害时营救措施都显得不够。人类真正的敌人往往不是飓风、地震等，而是人类自己。
62.B) 介词辨析。本文第一句话意为：历史上，人类只有在遭受过灾难之后才会对防灾变得重视起来。通过对此句的分析，知道了后句紧跟的词应该表示解释说明。而to意为“至于……"，on意为“在……上面".for意为“为了……，"by意为“根据……”。只有by that logic（根据这一逻辑）符合文意，因此，正确答案为B
63.A) 词义辨析。初看本题似乎考查obvious，apparent，evident三词的区别，它们都意为“明显的”。但根据上下文，此处应该表示“记忆犹新”之意，而只有fresh memory搭配在一起符合此意，因此，A为正确答案。
64.C) 词义辨析。本句意为：美国人通过电视直播观看了美国历史上最严重的灾难——腿风卡特里娜。live这个词除了有“生活”的意思外，还有“现场直播"之意，因此答案为C。而visual（视觉的）、vivid（生动的）、lively（活泼的）均不合文意。
65.D) 语法考查。在比较级前添加副词只能用原级，不能用比较级，B、C明显错误。而little也不能直接修饰比较级。另外，本句句首的并列连词and说明同前一句关系密切，本句中they就是指前一句中的bad things，因此，根据上下文应选much。
66.A) 词义辨析。本句意为：由于我们对危险故意视而不见，在所有事出大错前不愿合作，坏事就变得更糟糕。本句中willful blindness意思是“视而不见"。而reluctance（不情愿）刚好与willful blindness形成同义衔接，符合文意。其余的rejection（拒绝）、denial（否定）、decline（谢绝）虽然都有否定之意，但意思太重。
67.D) 词义辨析。本句意为：的确，某些错觉很可能是人类生存状况的一部分。human与condition搭配，刚好表示“人的生存状况”之意。因此答案为D。world明显错误。Natural、social与condition搭配，分别表示“自然条件”和“社会条件”，不符合文意。
68.C) 词义辨析。本题关键得看句中的连词and和副词immediately。地震后马上接着该干什么呢？当然是重建。因此，rebuilding（重建）符合文意。其余的revising（修订）、refining（提炼）、retrieving（重新得到）均不合文意。
69.A) 词义辨析。从空格后的history便知此处有“回顾历史”之意，因此选项A正确。而reminder（提醒，暗示）、concept（观念，想法）、prospect（前景，期望）均与文意不符。
70.C) 固定搭配。protect sb.from sth.保护某人免受某事（之害）。四个选项中只有protect能与from搭配。prepare（准备）、protest（抗议）、prevail（流行）都不能。
71.B) 副词辨析。本句意为：有关我们所面临的灾难，我们比以前知道得更多。本句中用助动词did替代前面的实义动词know。A、C两项明显不对；before做副词时应放在句末，也不对；ever常用于比较从句中，表示“以往任何时候"，在这里符合文意。
72.D) 固定搭配。It turns out that...证明……。tur up意为“出现"，turn down意为"拒绝”，turn over意为“反复考虑”。
73.B) 词义辨析。本题涉及两组词，一组是merely和rarely，一组是incidentally 和accidentally。后一组均表示“偶然地"，与文意不符，很快便可排除。关键在于区分前一组词。merely表示“仅仅、只不过”，如果填入空白处意思太绝对；而rarely意为“极少、罕有"，根据上下文，这里应填一个具有否定意义的词，因此rarely最恰当。
74.A) 词义辨析。本句意为：在危机时，我们最大的敌人往往不是暴风、地震或巨浪，而是我们自己。本题考查的实际上是形近词。surge意为“波涛汹涌"：spur意为"刺激，鞭策"surf意为“海浪，冲浪"；splash意为“飞溅"。从上下文能看出此空该填一个灾难性的词，因此，正确答案为A。
75.C) 词义辨析。四个词中只有follow有“紧跟其后”之意，并能直接跟宾语。ensue虽有“相继发生”之意，但为不及物动词。trace意为“跟踪，探索"，意思不符。occur意为“发生，出现"，后面不直接跟宾语。因此，C为正确答案。
76.C) 语法考查。此句意为：他们（重建）使防洪堤尽量恢复思风前的状态。此句考查的是名词性从句。四个选项中只有what能引导名词性从句并充当介词后宾语。which虽然能充当介词后宾语，但找不到其先行词，句意不通；where为关系副词，引导的从句前不用介词；when通常引导时间状语从句，故从语法、意义两方面看都不正确。因此，答案为C。
77.A) 词义辨析。此句意为：这还不够，我们现在可以自信地说。enough（足够的）符合文意。certain（确定的）、conclusive（确实的）、final（最后的）均与文意不符。
78.C) 语法考查。此句考查的是定语从句。先行词为all时，后面的关系代词通常用that。而but为转折连词，as为因果连词，those为指示代词，在此均不恰当。
79 B) 词义辨析。此句意为：同时，新奥尔良官方已计划使用汽车和火车将病残人员疏散到安全地带。evacuate（疏散，将人们转移到安全处）正好符合文意。exile（流放）、dismiss（解散）都是负性动词，与救灾之举相矛盾。displace（取代，替换）也不正确。因此，正确答案为B。
80.A) 词义辨析。根据79题这句话的意思，官方要帮助人们转移到其它地方，而ride刚好有"搭乘“之义，符合文意。rail（痕迹）、path（路径）、track（轨迹）均与文意不符。
81.D) 词义辨析。此句意为：（官方）与邻区的谈判正在进行，不过非常困难。conventions（惯例，协定）与notifications（通知，布告）通常不与difficult搭配；communications（传达，交流）与difficult 搭配后为“信息不畅、说不清”之意，意思不对；在此只有negotiations（商议，谈判）符合文意，为最佳答案。
Part VI  Translation
82.competing with foreign companies/firms for market share
　　本题考查固定搭配compete with sb.for sth以及词组market share，另外，发现某人正在做某事要用非谓语动词形式find sb.doing sth.。外国公司还可译为overseas companies firms。
83.does he feel secure and relaxed
　　本题主要考查以only开头的倒装句的用法。注意：only位于句首表示强调时，其后的句子需用倒装语序。另外，secure本身就是形容词“安全的"，可直接作表语，不需要再加-ed。
84.are deprived of the right to receive education/are denied the right to receive education
　　本题主要考查“被剥夺……”的译法，既可用be deprived of sth.，也可用be denied sth.。不定式短语to receive education在句中作后置定语。
85.let alone/not to mention/not to speak of the large sum of money we have spent
　　本题主要考查“更别提……”的译法：let alone，not to mention或not to speak of，后面都可直接跟宾语。另外，“大量金钱”还可说成the large amount of money。定语从句we have spent在句中修饰money。
86.have received/got great attention from the public in recent decades
　　本题主要考查“受关注"的译法。句中有“最近几十年"，表明要用现在完成时态。另外，“受到公众相当大的关注”也可直接翻译成gain considerable public concern。

Seven Ways to Save the World
　　　Forget the old idea that conserving energy is a form of self-denial — riding bicycles, dimming the lights, and taking fewer showers. These days conservation is all about efficiency: getting the same — or better — results from just a fraction of the energy. When a slump in business travel forced Ulrich Rǒmer to cut cost costs at his family-owned hotel in Germany, he replaced hundreds of the hotel’s wasteful light bulbs, getting the same light for 80 percent less power. He bought a new water boiler with a digitally controlled pump, and wrapped insulation around the pipes. Spending about € 100,000 on these and other improvements, he slashed his € 90,000 fuel and power bill by € 60,000. As a bonus, the hotel’s lower energy needs have reduced its annual carbon emissions by more than 200 metric tons. “For us, saving energy has been very, very profitable,” he says. “And most importantly, we’re not giving up a single comfort for our guests.”
     Efficiency is also a great way to lower carbon emissions and help slow global warming. But the best argument for efficiency is its cost — or, more precisely, its profitability. That’s because quickly growing energy demand requires immense investment in new supply, not to mention the drain of rising energy prices.
     No wonder efficiency has moved to the top of the political agenda. On Jan. 10, the European Union unveiled a plan to cut energy use across the continent by 20 percent by 2020. Last March, China imposed a 20 percent increase in energy efficiency by 2020. Even George W. Bush, the Texas oilman, is expected to talk about energy conversation in his State of the Union speech this week.
     The good news is that the world is full of proven, cheap ways to save energy. Here are the seven that could have the biggest impact:
Insulate 
　　　Space heating and cooling eats up 36 percent of all the world’s energy. There’s virtually no limit to how much of that can be saved, as prototype “zero-energy homes” in Switzerland and Germany have shown. There’s been a surge in new ways of keeping heat in and cold out (or vice versa). The most advanced insulation follows the law of increasing returns: if you add enough, you can scale down or even eliminate heating and air-conditioning equipment, lowering costs even before you start saving on utility bills. Studies have shown that green workplaces (ones that don’t constantly need to have the heat or air-conditioner running) have higher worker productivity and lower sick rates.
Change Bulbs
　　　Lighting eats up 20 percent of the world’s electricity, or the equivalent of roughly 600,000 tons of coal a day. Forty percent of that powers old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs — a 19th-century technology that wastes most of the power it consumes on unwanted heat.
　　　Compact fluorescent lamps, or CFLs, not only use 75 to 80 percent less electricity than incandescent bulbs to generate the same amount of light, but they also last 10 times longer. Phasing old bulbs out by 2030 would save the output of 650 power plants and avoid the release of 700 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year.
Comfort Zone 
　　　Water boilers, space heaters and air conditioners have been notoriously inefficient. The heat pump has altered that equation. It removes heat from the air outside or the ground below and uses it to supply heat to a building or its water supply. In the summer, the system can be reversed to cool building as well.
　　　Most new residential buildings in Sweden are already heated with ground-source heat pumps. Such systems consume almost no conventional fuel at all. Several countries have used subsidies to jump-start the market, including Japan, where almost 1 million heat pumps have been installed in the past two years to heat water for showers and hot tubs.
Remake Factories 
     From steel mills to paper factories, industry eats up about a third of the world’s energy. The opportunities to save are vast. In Ludwigshafen, German chemicals giant BASF runs an interconnected complex of more than 200 chemical factories, where heat produced by one chemical process is used to power the next. At the Ludwigshafen site alone, such recycling of heat and energy saves the company € 200 million a year and almost half its CO2 emissions. Now BASF is doing the same for new plants in China. “Optimizing (优化) energy efficiency is a decisive competitive advantage, ” says BASF CEO Jǔrgen Hambrecht.
Green Driving 
　　　A quarter of the world’s energy — including two thirds of the annual production of oil — is used for transportation. Some savings come free of charge: you can boost fuel efficiency by 6 percent simply by keeping your car’s tires properly inflated (充气). Gasoline-electric hybrid (混合型) models like the Toyota Prius improve mileage by a further 20 percent over conventional models.
A Better Fridge
　　　More than half of all residential power goes into running household appliances，producing a fifth of the world’s carbon emissions. And that’s true even though manufacturers have already hiked the efficiency of refrigerators and other white goods by as much as 70 percent since the 1980s. According to an International Energy Agency study, if consumers chose those models that would save them the most money over the life of the appliance, they’d cut global residential power consumption and their utility bills by 43 percent.
Flexible Payment 
     Who says you have to pay for all your conservation investment？“Energy service contractors” will pay for retrofitting (翻折改造) in return for a share of the client’s annual utility-bill savings. In Beijing, Shenwu Thermal Energy Technology Co. specializes in retrofitting China’s steel furnaces. Shenwu puts up the initial investment to install a heat exchanger that preheats the air going into the furnace，slashing the client’s fuel costs . Shenwu pockets a cut of those savings, so both Shenwu and the client profit.
　　 If saving energy is so easy and profitable, why isn’t everyone doing it? It has to do with psychology and a lack of information. Most of us tend to look at today’s price tag more than tomorrow’s potential savings. That holds double for the landlord or developer, who won’t actually see a penny of the savings his investment in better insulation or a better heating system might generate. In many people’s minds, conservation is still associated with self-denial. Many environmentalists still push that view.
　　　Smart governments can help push the market in the right direction. The EU’s 1994 law on labeling was such a success that it extended the same idea to entire buildings last year. To boost the market value of efficiency, all new buildings are required to have an “energy pass” detailing power and heating consumption. Countries like Japan and Germany have successively tightened building codes, requiring an increase in insulation levels but leaving it up to builders to decide how to meet them.
　　　　The most powerful incentives, of course, will come from the market itself. Over the past year, sky-high fuel prices have focused minds on efficiency like never before. Ever-increasing pressure to cut costs has finally forced more companies to do some math on their energy use.
　　　　Will it be enough? With global demand and emissions rising so fast, we may not have any choice but to try. Efficient technology is here now, proven and cheap. Compared with all other options, it’s the biggest, easiest and most profitable bang for the buck.

Part IV Reading Comprehension （Reading in Depth） （25 minutes）
Section A 
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
　　Men, these days, are embracing fatherhood with the round-the-clock involvement their partners have always dreamed of — handling night feedings, packing lunches and bandaging knees. But unlike women, many find they’re negotiating their new roles with little support or information. “Men in my generation (aged 25-40) have a fear of becoming dads because we have no role models,” says Jon Smith, a writer. They often find themselves excluded from mothers’ support networks, and are eyed warily (警觉地) on the playground.
　　The challenge is particularly evident in the work-place. There, men are still expected to be 
breadwinners climbing the corporate ladder: traditionally-minded bosses are often unsympathetic to family needs. In Denmark most new fathers only take two weeks of paternity leave (父亲的陪产假) — even though they are allowed 34 days. As much as if not more so than women, fathers struggle to be taken seriously when they request flexible arrangements.
　　Though Wilfried-Fritz Maring, 54, a data-bank and Internet specialist with German firm FIZ 
Karlsruhe, feels that the time he spends with his daughter outweighs any disadvantages, he admits, “With my decision to work from home I dismissed any opportunity for promotion.”
　　Mind-sets (思维定势) are changing gradually. When Maring had a daughter, the company equipped him with a home office and allowed him to choose a job that could be performed from there. Danish telecom company TDC initiated an internal campaign last year to encourage dads to 
take paternity leave: 97 percent now do. “When an employee goes on paternity leave and is with his kids, he gets a new kind of training: in how to keep cool under stress.” says spokesperson Christine Elberg Holm. For a new generation of dads, kids may come before the company － but it’s a shift that benefits both.

47. Unlike women, men often get little support or information from          .
48. Besides supporting the family, men were also expected to          .
49. Like women, men hope that their desire for a flexible schedule will be          .
50. When Maring was on paternity leave, he was allowed by his company to work         . 
51. Christine Holm believes paternity leave provides a new kind of training for men in that it can help them cope with          .
Section B 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　　Like most people, I’ve long understood that I will be judged by my occupation, that my profession is a gauge people use to see how smart or talented I am. Recently, however, I was disappointed to see that it also decides how I’m treated as a person.
　　Last year I left a professional position as a small-town reporter and took a job waiting tables. As someone paid to serve food to people. I had customers say and do things to me I suspect they’d never say or do to their most casual acquaintances. One night a man talking on his cell phone waved me away, then beckoned (示意) me back with his finger minute later, complaining he was ready to order and asking where I’d been.
　　I had waited tables during summers in college and was treated like a peon (勤杂工) plenty of people. But at 19 years old, I believed I deserved inferior treatment from professional adults. Besides, people responded to me differently after I told them I was in college. Customers would joke that one day I’d be sitting at their table, waiting to be served.
　　Once I graduated I took a job at a community newspaper. From my first day, I heard a respectful tone from everyone who called me. I assumed this was the way the professional world worked — cordially.
　　I soon found out differently. I sat several feet away from an advertising sales representative with a similar name. Our calls would often get mixed up and someone asking for Kristen would be transferred to Christie. The mistake was immediately evident. Perhaps it was because money was involved, but people used a tone with Kristen that they never used with me.
　　My job title made people treat me with courtesy. So it was a shock to return to the restaurant industry.
　　It’s no secret that there’s a lot to put up with when waiting tables, and fortunately, much of it can be easily forgotten when you pocket the tips. The service industry, by definition, exists to cater to others’ needs. Still, it seemed that many of my customers didn’t get the difference between server and servant.
　　I’m now applying to graduated school, which means someday I’ll return to a profession where people need to be nice to me in order to get what they want, I think I’ll take them to dinner first, and see how they treat someone whose only job is to serve them.
52. The author was disappointed to find that _______.
　　[A] one’s position is used as a gauge to measure one’s intelligence
　　[B] talented people like her should fail to get a respectable job
　　[C] one’s occupation affects the way one is treated as a person
　　[D] professionals tend to look down upon manual workers
53. What does the author intend to say by the example in the second paragraph?
　　[A] Some customers simply show no respect to those who serve them.
　　[B] People absorbed in a phone conversation tend to be absent-minded.
　　[C] Waitresses are often treated by customers as casual acquaintances.
　　[D] Some customers like to make loud complaints for no reason at all.
54. How did the author feel when waiting tables at the age of 19?
　　[A] She felt it unfair to be treated as a mere servant by professional.
　　[B] She felt badly hurt when her customers regarded her as a peon.
　　[C] She was embarrassed each time her customers joked with her.
　　[D] She found it natural for professionals to treat her as inferior.
55. What does the author imply by saying “…many of my customers didn’t get the difference between server and servant”(Lines 3-4, Para.7)?
　　[A] Those who cater to others’ needs are destined to be looked down upon.
　　[B] Those working in the service industry shouldn’t be treated as servants.
　　[C] Those serving others have to put up with rough treatment to earn a living.
　　[D] The majority of customers tend to look on a servant as server nowadays.
56. The author says she’ll one day take her clients to dinner in order to ________.
　　[A] see what kind of person they are
　　[B] experience the feeling of being served
　　[C] show her generosity towards people inferior to her
　　[D] arouse their sympathy for people living a humble life
Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　　What’s hot for 2007 among the very rich? A $7.3million diamond ring. A trip to Tanzania to hunt wild animals. Oh, and income inequality.
　　　Sure, some leftish billionaires like George Soros have been railing against income inequality for years. But increasingly, centrist and right-wing billionaires are staring to worry about income inequality and the fate of the middle class.
　　　In December, Mortimer Zuckerman wrote a column in U.S. News & World Report, which he owns. “our nation’s core bargain with the middle class is disintegrating,” lamented (哀叹) the 117th-richest man in America. “Most of our economic gains have gone to people at the very top of the income ladder. Average income for a household of people of working age, by contrast, has fallen five years in a raw.” He noted that “Tens of millions of Americans live in fear that a major health problem can reduce them to bankruptcy.”
　　　Wilbur Ross Jr. has echoed Zuckerman’s anger over the bitter struggles faced by middle-class Americans. “It’s an outrage that any American’s life expectancy should be shortened simply because the company they worked for went bankrupt and ended health-care coverage,” said the former chairman of the International Steel Group.
　　　What’s happening? The very rich are just as trendy as you and I, and can be so when it comes to politics and policy. Given the recent change of control in Congress, the popularity of measures like increasing the minimum wage, and efforts by California’s governor to offer universal health care, these guys don’t need their own personal weathermen to know which way the wind blows.
　　　It’s possible that plutocrats (有钱有势的人) are expressing solidarity with the struggling middle class as part of an effort to insulate themselves from confiscatory (没收性的) tax policies. But the prospect that income inequality will lead to higher taxes on the wealthy doesn’t keep plutocrats up at night. They can live with that.
　　　No, what they fear was that the political challenges of sustaining support for global economic integration will be more difficult in the United States because of what has happened to the distribution of income and economic insecurity.
　　　In other words, if middle-class Americans continue to struggle financially as the ultrawealthy grow ever wealthier, it will be increasingly difficult to maintain political support for the free flow of goods, services, and capital across borders. And when the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods, it’s likely to encourage reciprocal action abroad. For people who buy and sell companies, or who allocate capital to markets all around the world, that’s the real nightmare.
57. What is the current topic of common interest among the very rich in America?
   [A] The fate of the ultrawealthy people.
   [B] The disintegration of the middle class.
   [C] The inequality in the distribution of wealth.
   [D] The conflict between the left and the right wing.
58. What do we learn from Mortimer Zuckerman’s lamentation?
   [A] Many middle-income families have failed to make a bargain for better welfare.
   [B] The American economic system has caused companies to go bankrupt.
　　[C] The American nation is becoming more and more divided despite its wealth.
　　[D] The majority of Americans benefit little from the nation’s growing wealth.
59. From the fifth paragraph we can learn that ________.
   [A] the very rich are fashion-conscious
   [B] the very rich are politically sensitive
   [C] universal health care is to be implemented throughout America
   [D] Congress has gained popularity by increasing the minimum wage
60. What is the real reason for plutocrats to express solidarity with the middle class?
   [A] They want to protect themselves from confiscatory taxation.
   [B] They know that the middle class contributes most to society.
   [C] They want to gain support for global economic integration.
   [D] They feel increasingly threatened by economic insecurity.
61. What may happen if the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods?
   [A] The prices of imported goods will inevitably soar beyond control.
   [B] The investors will have to make great efforts to re-allocate capital.
   [C] The wealthy will attempt to buy foreign companies across borders.
   [D]. Foreign countries will place the same economic barriers in return.

　　In 1915 Einstein made a trip to Göttingen to give some lectures at the invitation of the mathematical physicist David Hilbert. He was particularly eager － too eager, it would turn  62 － to explain all the intricacies of relativity to him. The visit was a triumph, and he said to a friend excitedly, “I was able to  63  Hilbert of the general theory of relativity.”
　　64  all of Einstein’s personal turmoil(焦躁) at the time, a new scientific anxiety was about to 65 . He was struggling to find the right equations that would  66  his new concept of gravity,  67  that would define how objects move  68  space and how space is curved by objects. By the end of the summer, he  69  the mathematical approach he had been  70  for almost three years was flawed. And now there was a  71  pressure. Einstein discovered to his  72  that Hilbert had taken what he had learned from Einstein’s lectures and was racing to come up  73  the correct equations first.
　　　It was an enormously complex task. Although Einstein was the better physicist, Hilbert was the better mathematician. So in October 1915 Einstein  74  himself into a month-long frantic endeavor in  75  he returned to an earlier mathematical strategy and wrestled with equations, proofs, corrections and updates that he  76  to give as lectures to Berlin’s Prussian Academy of Sciences on four  77  Thursdays.
　　　His first lecture was delivered on Nov. 4. 1915, and it explained his new approach,  78  he admitted he did not yet have the precise mathematical formulation of it. Einstein also took time off from  79  revising his equations to engage in an awkward fandango (方丹戈双人舞) with his competitor Hilbert. Worried  80  being scooped(抢先)，he sent Hilbert a copy of his Nov. 4 lecture. “I am  81  to know whether you will take kindly to this new solution.” Einstein noted with a touch of defensiveness.	　　　　　62.

2007年12月英语六级真题答案解析
Part I  Writing 
范文：
　　Living in the digital age, we are unavoidably exposed to all kinds of digital products, such as digital camera, digital computer, digital television, and so on, which grow in an increasing categories and quantities. Believe it or not, look around yourself and you can easily find one or two of these stuffs.
　　Here is a question，what kind of influence do the digital products bring to people’s life.? Frankly speaking, these modern digital products offer us a more convenient life than before. For example, the digital camera makes it possible to delete or correct the “unsuccessful” photo of ours, which was impossible with the traditional camera. While, unfortunately, these fashionable digital items have cultivated a generation more isolated from the real life. It is hard to imagine that a man so accustomed to the digital mobile on-line chatting can be capable of the practical communication with others. Finally, too much dependent on the digital things, human seem to be more indifferent to the real world, which we, though reluctant to admit, have to accept.
　　Thus, as the generation assailed by all kinds of digital miracles, we might as well initiatively avoid some of them despite efficiency and comfort they can supply. Don’t forget those old days when you were going to visit an old school friend though there would be a long train journey, which, in today’s digital era, has been thoroughly replaced by the digital on-line chatting.

Passage One    
Questions 26 to 29 are based on the passage you have just heard. 
     In January 1989, (26) the Community of European Railways presented their proposal for a high speed pan-European train network extending from Sweden to Sicily, and from Portugal to Poland by the year 2020. (27) If their proposal becomes a reality, it will revolutionize train travel in Europe. Journeys between major cities will take half the time they take today. Brussels will be only one and a half hours from Paris. The quickest way to get from Paris to Frankfurt, from Barcelona to Madrid will be by train, not plane. When the network is complete, it will integrate three types of railway line:totally new high speed lines with trains operating at speeds of 300 kilometers per hour, upgraded lines which allow for speeds up to 200 to 225 kilometers per hour, and existing lines for local connections and distribution of freight. If business people can choose between a three-hour train journey from city-center to city-center and a one-hour flight, they’ll choose the train, says an executive travel consultant. They won’t go by plane any more. (28) If you calculate flight time, check-in and travel to and from the airport, you’ll find almost no difference. And if your plane arrives late due to bad weather or air traffic jams or strikes, then the train passengers will arrive at their destination first. (29) Since France introduced the first 260-kilometer-per-hour high speed train service between Paris and Lyons in 1981, the trains have achieved higher and higher speeds. On many routes, airlines have lost up to 90% of their passengers to high speed trains. If people accept the Community of European Railways’ plan, the 21 century will be the new age of the train. 
预览四道题的选项，由选项中的词汇passengers, railroad, railway lines, express train, plane, airlines等表达可以推

27. What will happen when the proposal becomes a reality?
［答案］C) Traveling time by train between major European cities will be cut by half.
[听前猜测]四个选项关于旅行费用和旅行时间的变化、旅行方式的优劣，这些都与某一事件的后果有关，因此推测本题考查某一事件带来的影响。
[精解]短文中明确提到If their proposal becomes a reality, it will revolutionize train travel in Europe. Journeys 
between major cities will take half the time they take today，即“如果这一方案成为现实，欧洲铁路运输业将会发生革命性变化。主要城市间的旅行时间可以比现在缩短一半”，所以本题的答案为C)。

［答案］D) Traveling by train may be as quick as,or even quicker than, by air.
[听前猜测]四个选项都出现了than引导的比较级，而且比较的对象都是train travel和air travel，所以可以推测本题考查对train travel和air travel的比较。
[精解]文中提到，飞机旅行固然比火车旅行更快，但是如果把飞行时间和往返机场的时间加起来，两者几乎没有
什么区别了。而且，如果遇到恶劣天气或航班拥挤或罢工，乘坐火车的乘客将会最先到达目的地。综合而言，火车旅行可以和飞机旅行一样快，甚至比飞机旅行还要快。故选项D)正确。
29. When did France introduce the first high speed train service?
［答案］A) In 1981.
 [听前猜测]四个选项都是时间短语，因此本题肯定考查事情发生的时间，听音时注意将短文中提到每个事件及其发生的时间迅速记录下来，再根据问题进行判断。

Passage Two
Questions 30 to 32 are based on the passage you have just heard.
    (30) Western doctors are beginning to understand what traditional healers have always known that the body and the mind are inseparable. Until recently, modern urban physicians heal the body, psychiatrist the mind, and priests the soul. However, the medical world is now paying more attention to holistic medicine, which is an approach based on the belief that people’s state of mind can make them sick or speed their recovery from sickness. (31) Several study show that the effectiveness of a certain drug often depends on the patient’s expectations of it. For example, in one recent study, psychiatrist and a major hospital tried to see how patients could be made calm. They divided them into two groups. One group was given a drug while the other group received a harmless substance instead of medicine without their knowledge. Surprisingly, more patients in the second group showed the desired effect than those in the first group. In study after study, there’s a positive reaction in almost one-third of the patients taking harmless substances. How was this possible? How can such a substance have an effect on the body? (32) Evidence from a 1997 study at the University of California shows that several patients who received such substances were able to produce their own natural drug, that is, as they took the substance their brains released natural chemicals that act like a drug. Scientists theorized that the amount of these chemicals released by a person’s brain quite possibly indicates how much faith the person has in his or her doctor.

［答案］C) The mind and body should be taken as an integral whole.

［答案］D) A patient’s expectations of a drug have an effect on their recovery.
[听前猜测]四个选项中除了B)都提到了影响病人康复的因素，有doctor’s fame，harmless substances和patient’s expectations of a drug等，由此推测本题考查影响病人康复快慢的各种因素。
[精解]文章中间部分提到多项研究表明，the effectiveness of a certain drug often depends on the patient’s expectations of it，即“药效往往取决于病人对药物的期待程度”，选项D)是对此意的转述，故为正确答案。
32. What evidence does the 1997 study at the University of California produce?
［答案］B) The workings of the mind may help patients recover.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是与病人的治疗效果有关，听音时注意相关介绍。
[精解]文章在最后部分介绍了加州大学1997年的研究。研究表明，许多服用无毒物质的病人能够在体内释放出象药物一样的化学物质。换句话说，病人的意识对康复有很大的影响。
Passage Three
Questions 33 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.
33. 
     (35) So we’ve already talked a bit about the growth of extreme sports like rock-climbing. As psychologists, we need to ask ourselves: Why is this person doing this? Why do people take these risks and put themselves in danger when they don’t have to? (33) One common trait among risk-takers is that they enjoy strong feelings or sensations. We call this trait sensation-seeking. A sensation-seeker is someone who’s always looking for new sensations. What else do we know about sensation-seekers? Well, as I said, sensation-seekers like strong emotions. You can see this trait in many parts of a person’s life, not just in extreme sports. For example, many sensation-seekers enjoy hard rock music. They like the loud sound and strong emotion of the songs. Similarly, sensation-seekers enjoy frightening horror movies. They like the feeling of being scared and horrified while watching the movie. This feeling is even stronger for extreme sports where the person faces real danger. Sensation-seekers feel the danger is very exciting. In addition, sensation-seekers like new experiences that force them to push their personal limits. (34) For them, repeating the same things everyday is boring. Many sensation-seekers choose jobs that involve risk, such as starting a new business or being an emergency room doctor. These jobs are different everyday, so they never know what will happen. That’s why many sensation-seekers also like extreme sports. When you do rock-climbing, you never know what will happen. The activity is always new and different. 
预览三道题各选项，根据33、34题推断本文可能与一些高难度的刺激活动相关，如攀岩、看恐怖电影等。

35. What is the speaker’s profession?
［答案］B) A psychologist.
[听前猜测]四个选项都是表示人的职业的名词，因此推断本题考查人的职业。
[精解]文章主要谈论喜欢冒险的人喜欢做的事情及其原因，再加上文章一开始就提到
So we’ve already talked a bit about the growth of extreme sports like rock-climbing. As psychologists, we need to ask ourselves. . . 从说话的口气和自称psychologist可知，说话人的职业是psychologist，故选项B)正确。

Section A
    议论文。本文讨论了男性劳动者在身为人父后所面临的来自家庭和职场的双重压力。随着思维定势的转变，人们采取了一些灵活的方法来解决该问题，照顾子女和拼搏职场不再是完全对立的，而是变得相得益彰。
47. mother’s support networks
[定位]根据题干中的unlike women和support or information定位到原文第一段第2句But unlike women, many find they’re negotiating their new roles with little support or information和第4句They often find themselves excluded from mother’s support networks. . . 
[精解]本题问的是男女双方在获得支持和信息方面的不同。题干中的get little. . . 和第4句中的excluded是同义转述，两个句子都含有from引导的介词短语，from的宾语mother’s support networks就是本题的答案。
48. climb the corporate ladder
[定位]根据题干中的men were also expected to定位到原文第二段第2句There, men are still expected to be breadwinners climbing the corporate ladder. 
[精解]本题针对男士应该承担的责任提问，题干中已经给出了其责任之一：supporting family，这和第2句中的be breadwinners“负担家计的人”属同义转述。分析第2句的句子结构，现在分词climbing引导的短语作伴随状语，其内容就是男人应该承担的另一个责任，即climbing the corporate ladder。但是结合题干对原文作出的改变，be expected to后要接动词原形，故本题答案为climb the corporate ladder。
49. taken seriously
[定位]根据题干中的flexible schedule定位到原文第2段末句As much as if not more so than women, fathers struggle to be taken seriously when they request flexible arrangements. 
[精解]题干中的like是对原句中As much as if not more so than的概括与同义转述，desire和request，hope和struggle也为同义转述，同时两个句子结构相同，都使用了被动语态，所以答案就很清楚了，为taken seriously。
50. at home/in a home office
[定位]根据题干中的Maring, paternity leave和his company定位到原文第4段第2句When Maring had a daughter, the company equipped him with a home office and allowed him to chose a job that could be performed from there. 
[精解]本题针对Maring休陪产假时的工作地点提问。题干中Maring was on paternity leave(休陪产假)和原句中的Maring had a daughter(有了女儿)是同义转述，原句中提到公司为他配备了一间家庭办公室，显然是允许他在家中工作，所以本题的答案为at home或in a home office。
51. stress
[定位]根据题干中的人名Christine Holm, paternity leave和a new kind of training定位到原文末段第4句“When an employee goes on paternity leave and is with his kids, he gets a new kind of training:in how to keep cool under stress, ”says spokesperson Christine Elberg Holm. 
[精解]题目问为什么陪产假能够让男性员工得到锻炼。根据原句可知，陪产假可以让员工接受一种新的训练：如何在压力下保持冷静。结合题干，可见，陪产假可以帮助员工应对stress(压力)，这就是本题的答案。

53. A)。 [定位]由题干中提到的the example in the second paragraph定位到第2段。

[精解]推断题。本题问的是作者说这句话所要表达的深意。句子的意思是“很多顾客没有弄清楚server(侍者)和servant(仆人)的区别”，换句话说，许多顾客把给他们提供服务的服务生当成仆人了，在现代社会中，这显然是不正确的，即选项B)所述“服务行业的人员不应该被当成仆人来对待。”
56. A)。 [定位]由题干中的She’ll one day take her clients to dinner定位到原文末段最后一句I’ll take them to dinner first, and see how they treat someone whose only job is to serve them. 
[精解]推断题。原文中提到，对于有求于她的人，作者会先带他去吃饭，看看他是如何对待那些唯一的工作就是为他们提供服务的人。结合前文作者的经历和感受，可以看出，作者是想通过观察他对服务生的态度和举止来了解这个人的品性，故选项A)为答案。

参考译文：
       同大部分人一样，我早就明白人们会通过我从事的工作来判断我。我的职业就如同一个标尺，人们通过它来衡量我有多么聪明或睿智。(52)但是，最近令我深感失望的是，我看到工作同样也决定了身而为人的我将会如何被对待。
      去年，我辞职不再做小镇的记者，转而找了一份招待员的工作。做着领薪水为他人提供餐饮服务的工作，我遇到一些顾客，他们对我说了一些也做了一些我觉得他们从来没有对一般的熟人说过或做过的事情。(53)一天晚上一个拿着手机打电话的男子挥手示意我离开，然后不到一分钟又用手指示意我回来，埋怨说他已经准备好点菜，问我去哪里了。
    暑假里我在大学里当招待员，被很多人当作勤杂工一样对待。(54)但是年仅19岁的年龄，我认为接受一些来自成年职业人士的劣等对待并无不当。况且，在我告诉他们我在上大学时，他们对我的反应就会有所不同。客人们会对我开玩笑说，有朝一日我也可以坐在桌子边上，等候着有人提供服务。
    毕业之后，我在一家社区报纸找到了一份工作。从第一天起，我从任何一位称呼我的人口中听到的都是尊敬的口吻。我以为这就是职场的运作方式——诚恳。
    很快我有了不同的发现。我坐的位置距离一位和我的名字非常相似的广告销售代表仅有几英尺远。我们的电话经常混淆，Kristen的电话会被转接给Christie。错误很快就清楚了。也许是因为钱的缘故，对着Kristen讲话时，人们总是使用一种从来没有对我使用过的口吻。
     我的工作头衔让人们非常谦恭地对待我。所以，重新回到饭店行业让人感到震惊。
     站在桌边等顾客点菜时有很多需要容忍的事情，这已经不是什么秘密了。但是，幸运的是，当你拿到小费时，就会忘记很多的不满。服务业，顾名思义，它之所以存在就是要满足别人的需要。(55)而且，看起来我的很多顾客没有弄清楚server(侍者)和servant(仆人)的区别。
   现在我正在申请读研究生，这就意味着将来有一天我会重新找到一份工作，一份人们为了得到他们想得到的东西而对我非常友好的工作。(56)我想我会先带他们去吃饭，借机看一下他们是如何对待那些唯一的工作就是为他们提供服务的人。

Passage Two
57. C)。 [定位]由题干中的current topic of common interest among the very rich定位到原文首段。
[精解]细节题。题干中的current topic of common interest是对原文中hot一词的具体解释。对于富人们2007年最感兴趣的事情，原文中提到了三个：A $7. 3 million diamond ring，A trip to Tanzania to hunt wild animals和income inequality，其中第3个是最重要的，结合选项可以看出本题的答案是C)。
58. C)。 [定位]由题干中的Mortimer Zucherman’s lamentation定位到原文第三段中的一系列进行哀叹的话语。
[精解]语义题。第三段第3句提到“我们的大部分经济收入都进入了位于收入台阶最顶层的富翁的腰包中。形成鲜明对比的是，对于一家人都是工薪阶层的人来说，五年来的平均收入呈连续下降趋势。”选项C)“虽然财富在不断增加，但是美国人的贫富分化状况不断加大”对此进行了概括，是本题的答案。
59. B)。 [定位]由题干中的the fifth paragraph定位到原文第5段的内容。
[精解]推断题。第5段第2句提到“巨富者和你我一样都能跟得上潮流，在涉及政治和政策问题时，也是如此”，由此可见，巨富者不但关心时尚变化，而且十分关注政治和政策，即选项B)所说的“巨富者在政治上十分敏感”。
60. C)。 [定位]由题干中的plutocrats和express solidarity with the middle class定位到原文第6段首句It’s possible that plutocrats are expressing solidarity with the struggling middle class as part of an effort to insulate themselves from confiscatory tax policies. 
[精解]推断题。本题提问有钱有势的人向中产阶级表示团结的real reason(真正原因)。从表面上看，有钱有势的人向中产阶级表示团结，目的是防止出现没收性的税收政策，会觉得A)正确；但是继续往下读文章，第7段继续陈述了有钱有势的人害怕中产阶级的深层原因，也是真正原因：the political challenges of sustaining support for global economic integration will be more difficult in the United States. . . ，简而言之，他们希望在全球经济融合问
题上获得中产阶级的支持，这才是他们的最大利益所在，即C)所述内容。因此选项C)是本题的答案。61. D)。 [定位]由题干中的条件从句if the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods定位到原文末段第2句And when the United States places obstacles in the way of foreign investors and foreign goods, it’s likely to encourage reciprocal action abroad. 
[精解]语义题。题干的条件从句和原文中的很相似，而且题干中的what may happen是对原文中的it’s likely to. . . 的同义转述，后面的内容encourage reciprocal action abroad就是答案所在。reciprocal意为“相应的，交互的”，所以本题的答案为D)“作为回应，外国也会设置同样的经济壁垒”。

参考译文：
     (57)2007年巨富们对什么事情最关心？价值730万美元的钻戒。去坦桑尼亚旅行、打猎。哦，还有收入的不平等。
    的确，一些象George Soros一样的左派富翁多年来一直抨击收入不公平问题。但是，中间派议员们和右派富翁也越来越担心收入不公平问题和中产阶级的命运。
    12月份，Mortimer Zuckerman在自己拥有的《美国新闻与世界报导》上发表专栏文章。“我们国家与中产阶级之间的核心契约正在瓦解，”美国排名第117位的富翁哀叹道。“(58)我们的大部分经济收入都进入了位于收入台阶最顶层的富翁的腰包中。形成鲜明对比的是，对于一家人都是工薪阶层的人来说，五年来的平均收入呈连续下降趋势。”他说，“成百上千万美国人生活在恐惧中，他们害怕严重的健康问题会让他们破产。”
    Zuckerman对于中产阶级所面临的苦苦挣扎表示极大愤慨，Wilbur Ross Jr. 随即作出响应。“如果任何美国人寿命的缩短仅仅是因为他所工作的公司破产而没法享受健康救助，这简直就是暴行，”国际钢铁组织前任主席说。
   到底在发生着什么？(59)巨富者和你我一样都能跟得上潮流，在涉及政治和政策问题时，也是如此。就拿最近国会控制权发生的变化，增加最低工资举措的受欢迎以及加利福尼亚州州长努力推行普及健康救助的行动来说，这些人不需要个人天气预报员来了解风往哪个方向吹。
　　(60)有钱有势的人与苦苦挣扎的中产阶级表示团结以使他们远离没收性的税收政策。这一点是有可能的。但是收入不公平会导致对富者更多的税率的可能性并没有让有钱有势的人半夜里睡不着觉。他们能够承受得了。
　　不，(60)他们担心的是，因为收入分配和经济安全的现状，若要使全球经济融合得到越来越多的人的支持的政治挑战在美国会变得更困难。
    换句话说，如果美国的中产阶级继续在财政问题上挣扎，而巨富者越来越富有的话，物品、服务和资本跨越国境自由流通将越来越难获得政治上的支持。(61)当美国对外国投资者和外国商品设置障碍时，很有可能国外也会采取相对应的措施。这样，对于那些买卖公司或者向全球市场分配资本的人来说，这无疑是一个真正的梦魇。

For questions 1-7, choose the best answer from the four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage.
What will the world be like in fifty years?
    This week some top scientists, including Nobel Prize winners, gave their vision of how the world will look in 2056,fron gas-powered cars to extraordinary health advances, John Ingham reports on what the world’s finest minds believe our futures will be.
    For those of us lucky enough to live that long,2056 will be a world of almost perpetual youth, where obesity is a remote memory and robots become our companions.
    We will be rubbing shoulders with aliens and colonizing outer space. Better still, our descendants might at last live in a world at peace with itself.
    The prediction is that we will have found a source of inexbaustible, safe, green energy, and that science will have killed off religion. If they are right we will have removed two of the main causes of war-our dependence on oil and religious prejudice.
    Will we really, as today’s scientists claim, be able to live for ever or at least cheat the ageing process so that the average person lives to 150?
    Of course, all these predictions come with a scientific health warning. Harvard professor Steven Pinker says: “This is an invitation to look foolish, as with the predictions of domed cities and nuclear-powered vacuum cleaners that were made 50 year ago.”
Living longer
    Anthony Atala, director of the Wake Forest Institute in North Carolina, belives failing organs will be repaired by injecting cells into the body. They will naturally to straight to the injury and help heal it. A system of injections without needles could also slow the ageing process by using the same process to “tune” cells.
    Bruce Lahn, professor of human genetics at the University of Chicago, anticipates the ability to produce“unlimited supplies” of transplantable human organs without the needed a new organ, such as kidney, the surgeon would contact a commercial organ producer, give him the patient’s immuno-logical profile and would then be sent a kidney with the correct tissue type.
    These organs would be entirely composed of human cells, grown by introducing them into animal hosts, and alloweing them to deveoop into and organ in place of the animal’s own. But Prof. Lahn believes that farmed brains would be “off limits”.He says: “Very few people would want to have their brains replaced by someone else’s and we probably don’t want to put a human brain ing an animal body.”
    Richard Miller, a professor at the University of Michigan, thinks scientist could develop“an thentic anti-ageing drugs” by working out how cells in larger animals such as whales and human resist many forms of injuries. He says:“It’s is now routine, in laboratory mammals, to extend lifespan by about 40%. Turning on the same protective systems in people should, by 2056, create the first class of 100-year-olds who are as vigorous and productive as today’s people in their 60s”
Aliens
    Conlin Pillinger ,professor of planerary sciences at the Open University,says:”I fancy that at least we will be able to show that life didi start to evolve on Mars well as Earth.”Within 50years he hopes scientists will prove that alien life came here in Martian meteorites(陨石).
    Chris McKay,a planetary scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center.believes that in 50 years we may find evidence of alien life in ancient permanent forst of Mars or on other planers.
    He adds:”There is even a chance we will find alien life forms here on Earth.It mightbe as different as English is to Chinese.
    Priceton professor Freeman Dyson thinks it “likely” that life form outer space will be discovered defore 2056 because the tools for finding it, such as optical and radio detection and data processing,are improving.
    He ays:”As soon as the first evidence is found,we will know what to look for and additional discoveries are likely to follow quickly.Such discoveries are likely to have revolutionary consequences for biology, astronomy and philosophy. They may change the way we look at ourselves and our place in the universe.
Colonies in space
    Richard Gottprofessor of astrophysics at Princeton,hopes man will set up a self-sufficient colony on Mars,which would be a “life insurance policy against whatever catastrophes,natural or otherwise,might occur on Earth.
    “The real space race is whether we will colonise off Earth on to other worlds before money for the space programme runs out.”
Spinal injuries
    Ellen Heber-Katz,a professor at the Wistar Institude in Philadelphia,foresees cures for inijuries causing paralysis such as the one that afflicated Superman star Christopher Reeve.
    She says:”I believe that the day is not far off when we will be able to profescribe drugs that cause severes(断裂的) spinal cords to heal,hearts to regenerate and lost limbs to regrow.
    “People will come to expect that injured or diseased organs are meant to be repaired from within,inmuch the same way that we fix an appliance or automobile:by replancing the damaged part with a manufacturer-certified new part.”She predict that within 5 to 10 years fingers and toes will be regrown and limbs will start to be regrown a few years later. Reparies to the nervous system will start with optic nerves and,in time,the spinal cord.”Within 50years whole body replacement will be routine,”Prof.Heber-Katz adds.
Obesity
    Sydney Brenner,senior distinguished fellow of the Crick-Jacobs Center in California,won the 2002 Noblel Prize for Medicine and says that if there is a global disaster some humans will survive-and evolition will favour small people with bodies large enough to support the required amount of brain power.”Obesity,”he says.”will have been solved.”
Robots
    Rodney Brooks,professor of robotice at MIT,says the problems of developing artificial intelligence for robots will be at least partly overcome.As a result,”the possibilities for robots working with people will open up immensely”
Energy
    Bill Joy,green technology expert in Califomia,says:”The most significant breakthrought would be to have an inexhaustible source of safe,green energy that is substantially cheaper than any existing energy source.”
    Ideally,such a source would be safe in that it could not be made into weapons and would not make hazardous or toxic waste or carbon dioxide,the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming.   
Society
    Geoffrey Miller,evolutionary psychologist at the University of New Mexico,says:”The US will follow the UKin realizing that religion is nor a prerequisite (前提)for ordinary human decency.
    “This,science will kill religion-not by reason challenging faith but by offering a more practical,uniwersal and rewarding moral frameworkfor human interaction.”
    He also predicts that “ahsurdly wasteful”displays of wealth will become umfashionable while the importance of close-knit communities and families will become clearer.
    These there changer,he says,will help make us all”brighe\ter,wiser,happier and kinder”.

　　I'm interested in the criminal justice system of our country. It seems to me that something has to be done if we are to (36)         as a country. I certainly don't know what the answers to our problems are. Things certainly get (37)        in a hurry when you get into them. But I wonder if something couldn't be done to deal with some of these problems. One thing I'm concerned about is our practice of putting (38)       in jail who haven't harmed anyone. Why not work out some system (39)       they can pay back the debts they owe society instead of (40)        another debt by going to prison, and of course, coming under the (41)         of hardened criminals? I'm also concerned about the short prison sentences people are (42)        for serious crimes. Of course, one alternative to this is to (43)         capital punishment, but I'm not sure I would be for that. I'm not sure it's right to take an eye for an eye. (44)                     .

Part IV Reading Comprehension （Reading in Depth） （25 minutes）
Section A 
Directions:	In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
    if movie trailers(预告片)are supposed to cause a reaction, the preview for "United 93" more than succeeds. Featuring no famous actors, it begins with images of a beautiful morning and passengers boarding an airplane. It takes you a minute to realize what the movie's even about. That’s when a plane hits the World Trade Center. the effect is visceral(震撼心灵的). When the trailer played before "Inside Man" last week at a Hollywood theater, audience members began calling out, "Too soon!" In New York City, the response was even more dramatic. The Loews theater in Manhattan took the rare step of pulling the trailer from its screens after several complaints.
    "United 93" is the first feature film to deal explicitly with the events of September 11, 2001, and is certain to ignite an emotional debate. Is it too soon? Should the film have been made at all? More to the point, will anyone want to see it? Other 9/11 projects are on the way as the fifth anniversary of the attacks approaches, most notably Oliver Stone's " World Trade Center." but as the forerunner, "United 93"will take most of the heat, whether it deserves it or not.
    The real United 93 crashed in a Pennsylvania field after 40 passengers and crew fought back against the terrorists. Writer-director Paul Greengrass has gone to great lengths to be respectful in his depiction of what occurred, proceeding with the film only after securing the approval of every victim's family. "Was I surprised at the agreement? Yes. Very. Usually there’re one or two families who're more reluctant," Greengrass writes in an e-mail. "I was surprised at the extraordinary way the United 93 families have welcomed us into their lives and shared their experiences with us." Carole O'Hare, a family member, says, "They were very open and honest with us, and they made us a part of this whole project." Universal, which is releasing the film, plans to donate 10% of its opening weekend gross to the Flight 93 National Memorial Fund. That hasn't stopped criticism that the studio is exploiting a national tragedy. O'Hare thinks that's unfair. "This story has to be told to honor the passengers and crew for what they did," she says. "But more than that, it raises awareness. Our ports aren't secure. Our borders aren't secure. Our airlines still aren't secure, and this is what happens when you're not secure. That’s the message I want people to hear."

Section B
Directions:There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
    Imagine waking up and finding the value of your assets has been halved. No, you’re not an investor in one of those hedge funds that failed completely. With the dollar slumping to a 26-year low against the pound, already-expensive London has become quite unaffordable. A coffee at Starbucks, just as unavoidable in England as it is in the United States, runs about $8.
    The once all-powerful dollar isn’t doing a Titanic against just the pound. It is sitting at a record low against the euro and at a 30-year low against the Canadian dollar. Even the Argentine peso and Brazilian real are thriving against the dollar.
    The weak dollar is a source of humiliation, for a nation’s self-esteem rests in part on the strength of its currency. It’s also a potential economic problem, since a declining dollar makes imported food more expensive and exerts upward pressure on interest rates. And yet there are substantial sectors of the vast U.S. economy-from giant companies like Coca-Cola to mom-and-pop restaurant operators in Miami-for which the weak dollar is most excellent news.
    Many Europeans may view the U.S. as an arrogant superpower that has become hostile to foreigners. But nothing makes people think more warmly of the U.S. than a weak dollar. Through April, the total number of visitors from abroad was up 6.8 percent from last year. Should the trend continue, the number of tourists this year will finally top the 2000 peak? Many Europeans now apparently view the U.S. the way many Americans view Mexico-as a cheap place to vacation, shop and party, all while ignoring the fact that the poorer locals can’t afford to join the merrymaking. 
    The money tourists spend helps decrease our chronic trade deficit. So do exports, which thanks in part to the weak dollar, soared 11 percent between May 2006 and May 2007. For first five months of 2007, the trade deficit actually fell 7 percent from 2006.
    If you own shares in large American corporations, you’re a winner in the weak-dollar gamble. Last week Coca-Cola’s stick bubbled to a five-year high after it reported a fantastic quarter. Foreign sales accounted for 65 percent of Coke’s beverage business. Other American companies profiting from this trend include McDonald’s and IBM.
    American tourists, however, shouldn’t expect any relief soon. The dollar lost strength the way many marriages break up- slowly, and then all at once. And currencies don’t turn on a dime. So if you want to avoid the pain inflicted by the increasingly pathetic dollar, cancel that summer vacation to England and look to New England. There, the dollar is still treated with a little respect.

   A)They feel contemptuous of it

55 what is the author’s advice to Americans?
   A.They treat the dollar with a little respect
   B.They try to win in the weak-dollar gamble
   C.They vacation at home rather than abroad
   D.They treasure their marriages all the more.

   C.The dollar’s value will drop, but within a small margin.
   D.Few Americans will change dollars into other currencies.
Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
     In the college-admissions wars, we parents are the true fights. We are pushing our kids to get good grades, take SAT preparatory courses and build resumes so they can get into the college of our first choice. I’ve twice been to the wars, and as I survey the battlefield, something different is happening. We see our kids’ college background as e prize demonstrating how well we’ve raised them. But we can’t acknowledge that our obsession(痴迷) is more about us than them. So we’ve contrived various justifications that turn out to be half-truths, prejudices or myths. It actually doesn’t matter much whether Aaron and Nicole go to Stanford.
     We have a full-blown prestige panic; we worry that there won’t be enough prizes to go around. Fearful parents urge their children to apply to more schools than ever. Underlying the hysteria(歇斯底里) is the belief that scarce elite degrees must be highly valuable. Their graduates must enjoy more success because they get a better education and develop better contacts. All  that is plausible——and mostly wrong. We haven’t found any convincing evidence that selectivity or prestige matters. Selective schools don’t systematically employ better instructional approaches than less selective schools. On two measures——professors’ feedback and the number of essay exams——selective schools do slightly worse.
     By some studies, selective schools do enhance their graduates’ lifetime earnings. The gain is reckoned at 2-4% for every 100-poinnt increase in a school’s average SAT scores. But even this advantage is probably a statistical fluke(偶然). A well-known study examined students who got into highly selective schools and then went elsewhere. They earned just as much as graduates from higher-status schools.
     Kids count more than their colleges.Getting into yale may signify intellgence,talent and Ambition. But it’s not the only indicator and,paradoxically,its significance is declining.The reason:so many similar people go elsewhere.Getting into college is not life only competiton.Old-boy networks are breaking down.princeton economist Alan Krueger studied admissions to one top Ph.D.program.High scores on the GRE helpd explain who got in;degrees of prestigious universities didn’t.
     So,parents,lighten up.the stakes have been vastly exaggerated.up to a point,we can rationalize our pushiness.America is a competitive society;our kids need to adjust to that.but too much pushiness can be destructive.the very ambition we impose on our children may get some into Harvard but may also set them up for disappointment.one study found that,other things being equal,graduates of highly selective schools experienced more job dissatisfaction.They may have been so conditioned to deing on top that anything less disappoints.

2008年6月大学英语六级(CET-6)参考答案

Part 1 Writing
范文一

Recent decades have seen the rapid development of information technology, and thereby E-books have wound their way into our daily life. Because of the wide and quick popularity of E-books, there has been an increasing controversy over the question of whether E-books will replace traditional books or not.

Many people hold the idea that it will not take long for E-books to replace traditional books because E-books have quite a few advantages over traditional ones. First, E-books are more accessible to readers, because the readers just need to log onto the internet and read online. Second, thanks to the advanced technology, the cost of E-books is much lower, so it takes readers far less money to buy E-books. Last but not the least, reading E-books has developed into part of our daily life, which is particularly appealing to young users, who are the body part of the users of electronic products.

As far as I’m concerned, it is not likely for E-books to replace traditional books for lots of reasons. For example, long time of reading E-books will do more harm to our eyes, and readers will find themselves more accessible to printed materials because computers and the internet haven’t yet been popularized to every corner of our life.

范文二

E-books, or electronic books, have the same information and need the same reading experience as the traditional books, which you actually hold in your hands. E-books have so many benefits that they will replace traditional books.

E-books can be created on a shoestring budget while the authors of traditional books will have to overcome a tough sales target before they even consider making a profit on the book. E-books are quicker to create because they could be written and published in as little as a week while the time span between starting a traditional book and writing it could take around a year or two. E-books are easier to target a wide market because they may be sold on the Internet to anyone with a credit card and an Internet connection in any place in the world, while with a traditional book it may be difficult to expand to new markets, since it will involve further significant costs on distribution and marketing.

To conclude, E-books are a very valuable tool that could be used as a profit centre, as a publishing tool or as a marketing tool. They have many advantages over the traditional books. E-books will replace traditional books.

Passage One
Water scooters are water vehicles that look very much like motorcycles. Nowadays, speedy, colorful water scooters are gaining in popularity. They can travel anywhere a small boat can and particularly popular with young people. The rising popularity of the craft has raised the question of water scooter regulation. In this case, the argument for strict regulation is compelling. Water scooters are a particularly deadly form of water recreation. For example, two women were vacationing in Longboat Key while they were floating on the rubber boat along the shore, a water scooter crashed into them and kill them. Also water scooter operators have been killed or seriously injured in collisions with other water craft. Others have been stranded at the sea when their scooters either failed or sank far from shore. Many water scooter operators are inexperienced and ignorant of navigational rules, which increase the potential for accidents. The increasing popularity of the scooter has aggravated the problem, providing more water vehicles to compete for the same space. Crowded water waves are simply an open invitation to disaster. In addition to the inherent operational hazards of water scooters, they are proving to be an environmental nuisance. Beach residents complain of the noise of the scooters. The Pacific Whale Foundation on the west coast expressed concern that the scooters are frightening away an endangered species of whale that migrates to Hawaii for breeding. Regulations such as minimum operating age, restricted operating areas and compulsory classes in water safety are essential. Without such regulations, tragedies involving water scooters are sure to multiply, which makes many beaches unsafe for recreation.
26. What does the speaker say about water scooters?
27. What is mentioned as one of the causes of water accidents?
28. In what way are water scooters said to be an environmental nuisance?
29. What does the speaker propose to ensure the safety of beaches for recreation?
Passage Two 
It seems to me that neighbors are going out of style in America. The friend nest door from whom you borrowed for eggs or a ladder has moved and the people in there now are strangers. Some of the traditional stories of neighborliness are impractical or silly and maybe just as well that our relations with our neighbors are changing. The saying in the Bible “Love thy neighbor” was probably a poor translation of what must have originally been, “respect thy neighbor”. Love can be called up on order. Fewer than half the people in the United States live in the same house they lived in five years ago. So there is no reason to love the people who live next door to you, just because they happen to wander into a real estate office that listed the place next door to yours. The only thing neighbors have in common, to begin with, is proximity and unless something more develops that isn’t reason enough to be best friends. It sometimes happens naturally, but the chances are very small that your neighbors will be your choices friends or that you will be theirs, either. The best relationship with neighbors is one of friendly distance. You say “hello”, use small talk if you see them in the yard, you discuss problems as they arise and you help each other in an emergency. The drive way or the fence between you is not really a cold shoulder but a clear boundary. We all like clearly-defined boundaries for ourselves.
30. What does the speaker say about the relations among neighbors nowadays?
31. Why does speaker say it may be difficult for people to love their neighbors?
32. What should neighbors do in the speaker’s opinion?
Passage Three
Articles in magazines and newspapers and special reports on radio and television reflect the concern of many Americans about the increasing drop-out rate in our junior and senior high schools. Coupled with this fact is the warning that soon we will no longer have a work force to fill the many jobs that require properly educated personnel. The high student drop-out rate is not a recent development. Ten years ago, many urban schools were reporting drop-out rates between 35 and 50 percent. Some administrators maintain that drop-outs remain the single greatest problem in their schools. Consequently, much effort has been spent on identifying students with problems in order to give them more attention before they become failures. Since the drop-out problem doesn’t start in senior high school, special programs in junior high school focus on students who show promise but have a record of truancy—that is staying away from school without permission. Under the guidance of counselors, these students are placed in classes with teachers who have had success in working with similar young people. Strategies to motivate students in a high school include rewarding academic excellence by designating scholars of the month, or by issuing articles of clothing, such as school letter jackets formerly given only to athletes. No one working with these students claims to know how to keep all students in school. Counselors, teachers and administrators are in the frontlines of what seems at times to be a losing battle. Actually, this problem should be everyone’s concern since uneducated, unemployed citizens affect us all.
33. Why are many Americans concerned with the increasing drop-out rate in school?
34. What do we learn about the student drop-out problem in America?
35. What is mentioned as one of the strategies used to motivate students?
Section C
I’m interested in the criminal justice system of our country. It seems to me that something has to be done, if we’re to survive as a country. I certainly don’t know what the answers to our problems are. Things certainly get complicated in a hurry when you get into them, but I wonder if something couldn’t be done to deal with some of these problems. One thing I’m concerned about is our practice of putting offenders in jail who haven’t harmed anyone. Why not work out some system whereby they can pay back the debts they owe society instead of incurring another debt by going to prison and, of course, coming under the influence of course, coming under the influence of hardened criminals. I’m also concerned about he short prison sentences people are serving for serious crimes. Of course one alternative to this is to restore capital pu8nishment, but I’m not sure I would be for that. I’m not sure it’s right to take an eye . The alternative to capital punishment is longer sentences but they would certainly cost the tax-payers much money. I also think we must do something about the insanity plea. In my opinion, anyone who takes another person’s life intentionally is insane; however, that does not mean that the person isn’t guilty of the crime or that he shouldn’t pay society the debt he owes. It’s sad, of course, that a person may have to spend the rest of his life, or a large part of it in prison for acts that he committed while not in full control of his mind.

Supersize Surprise
　　　Ask anyone why there is an obesity epidemic and they will tell you that it’s al down to eating too much and burning too few calories. That explanation appeals to common sense and has dominated efforts to get to the root of the obesity epidemic and reverse it. Yet obesity researchers are increasingly dissatisfied with it. Many now believe that something else must have changed in our environment to precipitate(促成) such dramatic rises in obesity over the past 40 years or so. Nobody is saying that the “big two” – reduced physical activity and increased availability of food – are not important contributors to the epidemic, but they cannot explain it all.
　　　Earlier this year a review paper by 20obesity experts set out the 7 most plausible alternative explanations for the epidemic. Here they are.
1.Not enough sleep 
　　　It is widely believed that sleep is for the brain, not the body. Could a shortage of shut-eye also be helping to make us fat?
　　　Several large-scale studies suggest there may be a link. People who sleep less than 7 hours a night tend to have a higher body mass index than people who sleep more, according to data gathered by the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Similarly, the US Nurses’ Health Study, which tracked 68,000 women for 16 years, found that those who slept an average of 5 hours a night gained more weight during the study period than women who slept 6 hours, who in turn gained more than whose who slept 7.
　　　It’s well known that obesity impairs sleep, so perhaps people get fat first and sleep less afterwards. But the nurses’ study suggests that it can work in the other direction too: sleep loss may precipitate weight gain.
　　　Although getting figures is difficult, it appears that we really are sleeping less. In 1960 people in the US slept an average of 8.5 hours per night. A 2002 poll by the National Sleep Foundation suggests that the average has fallen to under 7 hours, and the decline is mirrored by the increase in obesity.
2. Climate control
　　　We humans, like all warm-blooded animals, can keep our core body temperatures pretty much constant regardless of what’s going on in the world around us. We do this by altering our metabolic(新陈代谢的) rate, shivering or sweating. Keeping warm and staying cool take energy unless we are in the “thermo-neutral zone”, which is increasingly where we choose to live and work.
    There is no denying that ambient temperatures(环境温度) have changed in the past few decades. Between 1970 and 2000, the average British home warmed from a chilly 13C to 18C. In the US, the changes have been at the other end of the thermometer as the proportion of homes with air conditioning rose from 23% to 47% between 1978 and 1997. In the southern states – where obesity rates tend to be highest – the number of houses with air conditioning has shot up to 71% from 37% in 1978.
　　　Could air conditioning in summer and heating in winter really make a difference to our weight?
　　　Sadly，there is some evidence that it does-at least with regard to heating. Studies show that in comfortable temperatures we use less energy.
3. Less smoking 
　　　Bad news: smokers really do tend to be thinner than the rest of us, and quitting really does pack on the pounds, though no one is sure why. It probably has something to do with the fact that nicotine is an appetite suppressant and appears to up your metabolic rate.
　　 Katherine Flegal and colleagues at the US National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Maryland, have calculated that people kicking the habit have been responsible for a small but significant portion of the US epidemic of fatness. From data collected around 1991 by the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, they worked out that people who had quit in the previous decade were much more likely to be overweight than smokers and people who had never smoked .Among men, for example, nearly half of quitters were overweight compared with 37% of non-smokers and only 28%of smokers.
4. Genetic effects 
　　　Yours chances of becoming fat may be set, at least in part, before you were even born. Children of obese mothers are much more likely to become obese themselves later in life. Offspring of mice fed a high-fat diet during pregnancy are much more likely to become fat than the offspring of identical mice fed a normal diet. Intriguingly, the effect persists for two or three generations. Grandchildren of mice fed a high-fat diet grow up fat even if their own mother is fed normally-so you fate may have been sealed even before you were conceived.
5. A little older…
　　　Some groups of people just happen to be fatter than others. Surveys carried out by the US national center for health statistics found that adults aged 40 to 79 were around three times as likely to be obese as younger people. Non-white females also tend to fall at the fatter end of the spectrum: Mexican-American women are 30% more likely than white women to be obsess, and black women have twice the risk.
    In the US, these groups account for an increasing percentage of the population. Between 1970 and 2000 the US population aged 35 to 44 grew by43%.the proportion of Hispanic-Americans also grew, from under 5% to 12.5% of the population, while the proportion of black Americans increased from 11% to12.3%.these changes may account in part for the increased prevalence of obesity.
6. Mature mums 
    Mothers around the world are getting older. in the UK, the mean age for having a first child is 27.3,compared with 23.7 in 1970 .mean age at first birth in the US has also increased, rising from 21.4 in 1970 to 24.9 in 2000.
    This would be neither here nor there if it weren’t for the observation that having an older mother seems to be an independent risk factor for obesity. Results from the US national heart, lung and blood institute’s study found that the odds of a child being obese increase 14% for every five extra years of their mother’s age, though why this should be so is not entirely clear.
　　　Michael Symonds at the University of Nottingham, UK, found that first-born children have more fat than younger ones. As family size decreases, firstborns account for a greater share of the population. In 1964, British women gave birth to an average of 2.95 children; by 2005 that figure had fallen to 1.79. In the US in1976, 9.6% of woman in their 40s had only one child; in 2004 it was 17.4%. this combination of older mothers and more single children could be contributing to the obesity epidemic.
7. Like marrying like 
　　　Just as people pair off according to looks, so they do for size. Lean people are more likely to marry lean and fat more likely to marry fat. On its own, like marrying like cannot account for any increase in obesity. But combined with others—particularly the fact that obesity is partly genetic, and that heavier people have more children—it amplifies the increase form other causes.

Forbes magazine identified Nike’s president, Philip Knight, as the 53rd-richestman in the world in 2004. But Nike has not always been a large multimillion-dollar organization. In fact, Knight started the company by selling shoes from the back of his car at track meets.
　　　In the late1950s Philip Knight was a middle-distance runner on the University of Oregon track team, coached by Bill Bowerman. One of the top track coaches in the U.S., Bowerman was also known for experimenting with the design of running shoes in an attempt to make them lighter and more shock-absorbent. After attending Oregon, Knight moved on to do graduate work at Stanford University; his MBA thesis was on marketing athletic shoes. Once he received his degree, Knight traveled to Japan to contact the Onitsuka Tiger Company, a manufacturer of athletic shoes. Knight convinced the company’s officials of the potential for its product in the U.S. In 1963 he received his first shipment of Tiger shoes, 200 pairs in total.
　　　In 1964, Knight and Bowerman contributed $500 each to from Blue Ribbon Sports, the predecessor of Nike. In the first few years, Knight distributed shoes out of his car at local track meets. The first employees hired by Knight were former college athletes. The company did not have the money to hire “experts”, and there was no established athletic footwear industry in North America from which to recruit those knowledgeable in the field. In its early years the organization operated in an unconventional manner that characterized its innovative and entrepreneurial approach to the industry. Communication was informal; people discussed ideas and issues in the hallways, on a run, or over a beer. There was little task differentiation. There were no job descriptions, rigid reporting systems, or detailed rules and regulations. The team spirit and shared values of the athletes on Bowerman’s teams carried over and provided the basis for the collegial style of management that characterized the early years of Nikes.

47. While serving as a track coach, Bowerman tried to design running shoes that were _____________________.
48. During his visit to Japan, Knight convinced the officials of the Onitsuka Tiger Company that its product would have____________________________________.
49. Blue Ribbon Sports as unable to hire experts due to the absence of____________________ in North America. 
50. In the early years of Nike, communication within the company was usually carried out____________.
51. What qualities of Bowerman’s teams formed the basis of Nike’s early management style?
　　_______________________________________________________________.
Section B 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　　Sustainable development is applied to just about everything from energy to clean water and economic growth, and as a result it has become difficult to question either the basic assumptions behind it or the way the concept is put to use. This is especially true in agriculture, where sustainable development is often taken as the sole measure of progress without a proper appreciation of historical and cultural perspectives.
　　　To start with, it is important to remember that the nature of agriculture has changed markedly throughout history, and will continue to do so .medieval agriculture in northern Europe fed, clothed and sheltered a predominantly rural society with a much lower population density than it is today. It had minimal effect on biodiversity, and any pollution it caused was typically localized. In terms of energy use and the nutrients（营养成分）captured in the product it was relatively inefficient.
　　　Contrast this with farming since the start of the industrial revolution. Competition from overseas led farmers to specialize and increase yields. Throughout this period food became cheaper, safe and more reliable. However, these changes have also led to habitat（栖息地）loss and to diminishing biodiversity.
　　　What’s more, demand for animal products in developing countries is growing so fast that meeting it will require an extra 300 million tons of grain a year by 2050.yet the growth of cities and industry is reducing the amount of water available for agriculture in many regions.
　　　All this means that agriculture in the 21stcentury will have to be very different from how it was in the 20th.thiswill require radical thinking. For example, we need to move away from the idea that traditional practices are inevitably more sustainable than new ones. We also need to abandon the notion that agriculture can be “zero impact”. The key will be to abandon the rather simple and static measures of sustainability, which centre on the need to maintain production without increasing damage.
　　　Instead we need a more dynamic interpretation, one that looks at the pros and cons（正反两方面）of all the various way land is used. There are many different ways to measure agricultural performance besides food yield: energy use, environmental costs, water purity, carbon footprint and biodiversity. It is clear, for example, that the carbon of transporting tomatoes from Spain to the UK is less than that of producing them in the UK with additional heating and lighting. But we do not know whether lower carbon footprints will always be better for biodiversity.
　　　What is crucial is recognizing that sustainable agriculture is not just about sustainable food production.
52. How do people often measure progress in agriculture?
   A) By its productivity   	C) By its impact on the environment
   B) By its sustainability  	D) By its contribution to economic growth
53. Specialisation and the effort to increase yields have resulted in________.
   A) Localised pollution      	C) competition from overseas
   B) the shrinking of farmland  	D) the decrease of biodiversity
54. What does the author think of traditional farming practices?
   A) They have remained the same over the centuries
   B) They have not kept pace with population growth
   C) They are not necessarily sustainable
   D) They are environmentally friendly
55. What will agriculture be like in the 21st century
   A) It will go through radical changes
   B) It will supply more animal products
   C) It will abandon traditional farming practices
   D) It will cause zero damage to the environment
56 What is the author’s purpose in writing this passage?
   A) To remind people of the need of sustainable development
   B) To suggest ways of ensuring sustainable food production
   C) To advance new criteria for measuring farming progress
   D) To urge people to rethink what sustainable agriculture is
Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　　The percentage of immigrants (including those unlawfully present) in the United states has been creeping upward for years. At 12.6 percent, it is now higher than at any point since the mid1920s.
　　   We are not about to go back to the days when Congress openly worried about inferior races polluting America’s bloodstream. But once again we are wondering whether we have too many of the wrong sort newcomers. Their loudest critics argue that the new wave of immigrants cannot, and indeed do not want to, fit in as previous generations did.
　　　 We now know that these racist views were wrong. In time, Italians, Romanians and members of other so-called inferior races became exemplary Americans and contributed greatly, in ways too numerous to detail, to the building of this magnificent nation. There is no reason why these new immigrants should not have the same success.
　　　 Although children of Mexican immigrants do better, in terms of educational and professional attainment, than their parents UCLA sociologist Edward Telles has found that the gains don’t continue. Indeed, the fouth generation is marginally worse off than the third James Jackson, of the University of Michigan, has found a similar trend among black Caribbean immigrants, Tells fears that Mexican-Americans may be fated to follow in the footsteps of American blacks-that large parts of the community may become mired（陷入）in a seemingly  permanent state of poverty and Underachievement. Like African-Americans, Mexican-Americans are increasingly relegated to (降入)segregated, substandard schools, and their dropout rate is the highest for any  ethnic group in the country.
　　　 We have learned much about the foolish idea of excluding people on the presumption of the ethnic/racial inferiority. But what we have not yet learned is how to make the process of Americanization work for all. I am not talking about requiring people to learn English or to adopt American ways; those things happen pretty much on their own, but as arguments about immigration hear up the campaign trail, we also ought to ask some broader question about assimilation, about how to ensure that people , once outsiders , don’t forever remain marginalized within these shores.
     That is a much larger question than what should happen with undocumented workers, or how best to secure the border, and it is one that affects not only newcomers but groups that have been here for generations. It will have more impact on our future than where we decide to set the admissions bar for the latest ware of would-be Americans. And it would be nice if we finally got the answer right.
57. How were immigrants viewed by U.S. Congress in early days?
   A) They were of inferior races.
   B) They were a Source of political corruption.
   C) They were a threat to the nation’s security.
   D) They were part of the nation’s bloodstream.
58. What does the author think of the new immigrants?
   A) They will be a dynamic work force in the U.S.
   B) They can do just as well as their predecessors.
   C) They will be very disappointed on the new land.
   D) They may find it hard to fit into the mainstream.
59. What does Edward Telles’ research say about Mexican-Americans?
   A) They may slowly improve from generation to generation.
   B) They will do better in terms of educational attainment.
   C) They will melt into the African-American community.
   D) They may forever remain poor and underachieving.
60. What should be done to help the new immigrants?
   A) Rid them of their inferiority complex.
   B) Urge them to adopt American customs.
   C) Prevent them from being marginalized.
   D) Teach them standard American English.
61. According to the author, the burning issue concerning immigration is_______.
   A) How to deal with people entering the U.S. without documents
   B) How to help immigrants to better fit into American society
   C) How to stop illegal immigrants from crossing the border
   D) How to limit the number of immigrants to enter the U.S.

2008年12月大学英语六级(CET-6)参考答案

范文：
　　Students’ mental health has been playing an increasingly important role in our day-to-day life. Indeed, it is widely accepted that it has gained growing popularity among persons in all walks of life. There is a general discussion today about the issue of disorder in brains. Obviously, it is necessary that effective actions should be taken to prevent problems. Authorities in universities play a critical role in the situation. To begin with, schools, such as colleges or universities, can provide chances for the young men to ease their attention. What’s more, some are physically strong, but psychological problems are able to bring potential threats. Teaches may have a chance to find them in advance. Besides, specialists in this field are to be required to make full preparation for cases in time. Facing the crisis, experts can deal with it in a professional way, which means they have more or better opportunities to save us than others. (学校)
From the factors mentioned above, we may safely draw the conclusion that we can free ourselves from mental illness by taking certain precautions. For example, if you have pains or puzzles in mind, finding a friend to express these is a good way to release pressure. Certainly, there is little doubt that further attention will be paid to the issue.（我们）

2008年12月英语六级真题听力原文

Part III            Listening Comprehension        (35 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, you will hear 8 short conversations and 2 long conversations. At the end of each conversation, one or more questions will be asked about what was said. Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once. After each question there will be a pause. During the pause, you must read the four choices marked A), B), C) and D), and decide which is the best answer. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Now let’s begin with the eight short conversations:

11. M: I’m asked to pick up the guest speaker Bob Russel at the airport this afternoon, do you know what he looks like?
W: Well, he’s in his sixties, he stands out, he’s bald, tall and thin and has a beard.
Q: What do we conclude from the woman’s remarks about Bob Russel?

12. M: I am considering dropping my dancing class. I am not making any progress.
W: If I were you, I stick with it. It’s definitely worth time and effort.
Q: What does the man suggest the woman do?

13. W: You see I still have this pain in my back, this medicine the doctor gave me was supposed to make me feel better by now.
M: Maybe you should’ve taken it three times a day as you were told.
Q: What do we learn from the conversation?

14. M: Frankly, when I sat the back of the classroom, I can’t see the words on the board clearly.
W: Well, you’ve been wearing those same glasses as long as I’ve known you. Why not get a new pair? It wouldn’t cost you too much.
Q: What does the woman imply about the man’s glasses?

15. W: How come the floor is so wet? I almost slipped, what happened?
M: Oh, sorry! The phone rang the moment I got into the shower, anyway, I’ll wipe it up right now.
Q: Why was the floor wet according to the man?

16. M: The instructions on the package say that you need to some assembly yourself. I’ve spent all afternoon trying in vain to put this bookcase together.
W: I know what you mean, last time I tried to assemble a toy train for my son and I almost gave up.
Q: What does the man find difficult?

17. M: I’m getting worried about Jenny’s school work. All she talks about these days is volleyball games and all she does is practice, training and things like that.
W: Her grades on the coming exams will fall for sure. It’s high time we talk(ed) some sense to her.
Q: What are the speakers probably going to do?

18. W: Do you understand why the local people are opposed to the new dam up the river?
M: They are worried about the potential danger if the dam should break. The river is very wide above the proposed site.
Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
Now you’ll hear the two long conversations:
Conversation One
W: Mr. White, what changes have you seen in the champagne market in the last ten to fifteen years?
M: Well the biggest change has been the decrease in sales since the great boom years of the 1980s when champagne production and sales reached record levels.

W: Which was the best year?
M: Well the record was in 1989 when 249 million bottles of champagne was sold. The highest production level was reached in 1990 with a total of 293 million bottles. Of course since those boom years sales have fallen.
W: Has the market been badly hit by the recession?
M: Oh certainly, the economic problems in champagnes’ export markets that’s Europe, the United States, Japan, and of course the domestic market in France, the economic problems have certainly been one reason for the decrease in champagne sales.
W: And the other reasons?
M: Another important factor has been price. In the early 90s, champagne was very overpriced, so many people stop buying it. Instead they bought sparkling wines from other countries, in particular from Australia and Spain. And then there was another problem for champagne in the early 90s.
W: What was that?
M: There was a lot of rather bad champagne on the market. This meant the popularity of good sparkling wines increased even more. People was surprised by their quality and of course they were a lot cheaper than champagne.
W: Do you think the champagne market will recover in the future?
M: Oh, I’m sure it will. When the economic situation improves, I believe the market will recover.

Questions 19 to 21 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

19. What does the man say about champagne in the 1980s?
20. Why did sparkling wines become more popular than champagne in the early 90s?
21. What does the man think of the champagne market in the future?

Conversation Two
W: Right, well, in the studio this morning, for our interview spot is Peter Wilson. Peter works for Green Peace. So, Peter, welcome.
M: Thanks a lot. It’s good to be here.
W: Great! Now, Peter, perhaps you can tell us something about Green Peace and your job there.
M: Sure. Well, I’ll start by telling you roughly what Green Peace is all about. I actually work in London for the Green Peace organization. We’ve been going for a few decades and we’re a non-violent, non-political organization. We’re involved in anti-nuclear activity, conservation and protection of animals and protection and support of our eco-system. I’m the action organizer and arrange any protests.
W: Right! A pretty important role, Peter. What sort of protest would you organize?
M: Well, recently we’ve been involved in anti-nuclear campaigns. I, personally arranged for the demonstration against radioactive waste dumping in the Atlantic Ocean. We’ve got a few small Green Peace boats that we harass the dumping ship with.
W: Say? Hold on, Peter. I thought you said your organization was non-violent. What do you mean by "harass"?
M: Well, we circle round and round the ships and get in the way when they try to dump the drums of nuclear waste in the sea. We talk to the men and try to change, you know, yell at them to stop. We generally make ourselves as much of a nuisance as possible.
M: Well, people may think differently of your methods, but there’s no doubt you’re doing a great job. Keep it up and good luck. And thanks for talking with us.

Questions 22 to 25 are based on the conversations you have just heard.
22. What is the man’s chief responsibility in the Green Peace organization?
23. What has Green Peace been involved in recently?
24. How does Green Peace try to stop people from dumping nuclear waste?
25. What is the woman’s attitude towards the Green Peace’s campaigns?

Section B
Directions: In this section, you will hear 3 short passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once. After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
　　　To find out what the weather is going to be, most people go straight to the radio, television, or newspaper to get an expert weather forecast. But if you know what to look for, you can use your own senses to make weather predictions. There are many signs that can help you. For example, in fair weather the air pressure is generally high, the air is still and often full of dust, and far away objects may look vague. But when the storm is brewing, the pressure drops, and you are often able to see things more clearly. Sailors took note of this long ago, and came up with the saying, “The farther the sight, the nearer the rain.” Your sense of smell can also help you detect the weather changes. Just before it rains, odors become stronger, this is because odors are repressed in a fair high pressure center. When a bad weather low moves in, air pressure lessens and odors are released. You can also hear an approaching storm. Sounds bounce off heavy storm clouds and return to earth with increased force. An old saying describes it this way, “Sounds traveling far and wide a stormy day will be tied”. And don’t laugh at your grandmother if she says she can feel a storm coming. It is commonly known that many people feel pains in their bones or joints while the humidity rises, the pressure drops, and bad weather is on the way.

Questions 26 to 28 are based on the passage you have just heard:

26. Why does the speaker say we can see far away objects more clearly as a storm is approaching?
27. What does the speaker want to show by quoting a couple of old sayings?
28. What does the passage mainly talk about?

Passage Two

　　　Many days seem to bring numerous tasks and responsibilities. All of which apparently must be tackled right away. You spend a day putting out files, but by the end of the day, you haven’t accomplished any of the really important things you set out to do. In desperation, you draft a “to-do” list, but most days, you can make little progress with it. When you look at the list each morning, a big fat cloud of doom is right at the top. Those difficult, complex, important tasks, that are so crucial to get done, and so easy to avoid. Plenty of us create a “to-do” list to address feelings of being overwhelmed, but we rarely use these tools to their best effect. They wind out being guilt-provoking reminders of the fact that will over-committed and losing control of our priorities. According to Timothy Pikle, a professor of psychology at Carlton University in Ottawa, people often draw up a “to-do” list, and then that’s it. The list itself becomes the day’s achievement, allowing us to feel we’ve done something useful without taking on any real work. In fact, drawing up the list becomes a way of avoiding the work itself. Too often, the list is seen as the accomplishment for the day, reducing the immediate guilt of not working on the tasks at hand by investing energy in the list, says Pikle. When a list is used like this, it’s simply another way in which we lie to ourselves.

Questions 29 to 31 are based on the passage you have heard.

29. What is the problem that troubles many people nowadays according to the speaker?
30. According to the speaker, what too many people do to cope with their daily tasks?
31. According to psychologist Timothy Pikle, what do people find by the end of the day?

Passage Three
　　　In many stressful situations, the body’s responses can improve our performance. We become more energetic, more alert, better able to take effective action. But when stress is encountered continually, the body’s reactions are more likely to be harmful than helpful to us. The continual speeding up of bodily reactions and production of stress related hormones seem to make people more susceptible to heart disease. And stress reactions can reduce the disease fighting effectiveness of the body’s immune system, thereby increasing susceptibility to illnesses ranging from colds to cancer. Stress may also contribute to disease in less direct ways by influencing moods and behavior. People under stress may become anxious or depressed, and as a result may eat too much or too little, have sleep difficulties or fail to exercise. These behavioral changes may in turn be harmful to the health. In addition, people are more likely to pay attention to certain bodily sensations such as aches and pains when they are under stress and to think that they’re sick. If the person were not under stress, the same bodily sensations might not be perceived as symptoms and the person might continue to feel well. Some researchers have suggested that assuming the role of a sick person is one way in which certain people try to cope with stress. Instead of dealing with the stressful situation directly, these people fall sick. After all, it is often more acceptably in our society to be sick and to seek medical help than it is to admit that one can not cope with the stresses of life.

Questions 32 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard.

32. What does the speaker say about people who encounter stress once in a while?
33. What does the speaker say frequent stress reactions may lead to?
34. What are people more likely to do when they are under stress?
35. What does the passage mainly talk about?

Section C
Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks numbered from 36 to 43 with the exact words you have just heard. For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 you are required to fill in the missing information. For these blanks, you can either use the exact words you have just heard or write down the main points in your own words. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

Now listen to the passage:

　　　One of the most common images of an advanced, Western-style culture is that of a busy, traffic-filled city. Since their first（36）appearance on American roadways, automobiles have become a（37）symbol of progress, a source of thousands of jobs and an almost inalienable right for citizens’ personal freedom of movement. In recent（38）decades, our “love affair” with the car is being（39）exported directly to the developing world, and it is increasingly（40）apparent that this transfer is leading to disaster.
　　　American’s almost complete dependence on automobiles has been a terrible mistake. As late as the 1950s, a large（41）percentage of the American public used mass transit. A（42）combination of public policy decisions and corporate scheming saw to it that countless（43）convenient and efficient urban streetcar and intra-city rail systems were dismantled（拆除）.（44）Our air quality now suffers from the effects of pollutants emitted directly from our cars. Our lives have been planned along a road grid — homes far from work, shopping far from everything, with ugly stretches of concrete and blacktop in between.
　　　Developing countries are copying Western-style transportation systems down to the last detail.（45）The problems caused by motorized vehicles in the West are often magnified in developing nations. Pollution control measures are either not strict or nonexistent, leading to choking clouds of smog. Gasoline still contains lead, which is extremely poisonous to humans.（46）Movement in some cities comes to a virtual standstill as motorized traffic competes with bicycles and pedestrians.
　　　In addition to pollution and traffic jams, auto safety is a critical issue in developing nations.

Helicopter Moms vs. Free-Range Kids
　　Would you let your fourth-grader ride public transportation without an adult? Probably not. Still, when Lenore Skenazy, a columnist for the New York Sun, wrote about letting her son take the subway alone to get back to "Long story short :my son got home from a department store on the Upper East Side, she didn’t expect to get hit with a wave of criticism from readers.
　　“Long story short: My son got home, overjoyed with independence,” Skenazy wrote on April 4 in the New York Sun. “Long story longer: Half the people I’ve told this episode to now want to turn on in for child abuse. As if keeping kids under lock and key and cell phone and careful watch is the right way to rear kids. It’s not. It’s debilitating (使虚弱)—for us and for them.”
　　Online message boards were soon full of people both applauding and condemning Skenazy’s decision to let her son go it alone. She wound up defending herself on CNN (accompanied by her son) and on popular blogs like the buffing ton post, where her follow-up piece was ironically headlined “More From America’s Worst Mom.”
　　The episode has ignited another one of those debates that divides parents into vocal opposing camps. Are Modern parents needlessly overprotective, or is the world a more complicated and dangerous place than it was when previous generations were allowed to wander about unsupervised? 
　　From the “she’s an irresponsible mother” camp came: “Shame on you for being so careless about his safety,” in Comments on the buffing ton post. And there was this from a mother of four: “How would you have felt if he didn’t come home?” But Skenazy got a lot of support, too, with women and men writing in with stories about how they were allowed to take trips all by them selves at seven or eight. She also got heaps of praise for bucking the “helicopter parent” trend: “Good for this Mom,” one commenter wrote on the buffing ton post. “This is a much-needed reality check.”
　　Last week, encouraged by all the attention, Skenazy started her own blog—Free Range, kids—promoting the idea that modern children need some of the same independence that her generation had. In the good old days nine-year-old baby boomers rode their bikes to school, walked to the store, took buses—and even subways—all by themselves. Her blog, she says, is dedicated to sensible parenting. “At Free Range Kids, we believe in safe kids. We believe in car seats and safety belts. We do NOT believe that every time school-age children go outside, they need a security guard.”
　　So why are some parents so nervous about letting their children out of their sight? Are cities and towns less safe and kids more vulnerable to crimes like child kidnap and sexual abuse than they were in previous generations?
　　Not exactly. New York City, for instance, is safer than it’s ever been; it’s ranked 36th in crime among all American cities. Nationwide, stringer kidnaps are extremely rare; there’s a one-in-a-million chance a child will be taken by a stranger, according to the Justice Department. And 90 percent of sexual abuse cases are committed by someone the child knows. Mortality rates from all causes, including disease and accidents, for American children are lower now than they were 25 years’ ago. According to Child Trends, a nonprofit research group, between 1980 and 2003 death rates dropped by 44 percent for children aged 5 to 14 and 32 percent for teens aged 15 to 19.
　　Then there’s the whole question of whether modern parents are more watchful and nervous about safety than previous generations. Yes, some are. Part of the problem is that with wall to wall Internet and cable news, every missing child case gets so much airtime that it’s not surprising even normal parental anxiety can be amplified. And many middle-class parents have gotten used to managing their children’s time and shuttling them to various enriching activities, so the idea of letting them out on their own can seem like a risk. Back in 1972, when many of today’s parents were kids, 87 percent of children who lived within a mile of school walked or biked every day. But today, the Centers for Disease Control report that only 13 percent of children bike, walk or otherwise t themselves to school.
　　The extra supervision is both a city and a suburb phenomenon. Parents are worried about crime, and they are worried about kids getting caught in traffic in a city that’s not used to pedestrians. On the other hand, there are still plenty of kids whose parents give them a lot of independence, by choice or by necessity. The After School Alliance finds that more than 14 million kids aged 5 to 17 are responsible for taking care of themselves after school. Only 6.5 million kids participate in organized programs. “Many children who have working parents have to take the subway or bus to get to school. Many do this by themselves because they have no other way to get to the schools,” says Dr. Richard Gallagher, director of the Parenting Institute at the New York University Child Study Center.
　　For those parents who wonder how and when they should start allowing their kids more freedom, there’s no clear-cut answer. Child experts discourage a one-size-fits-all approach to parenting. What’s right for Skenazy’s nine-year-old could be inappropriate for another one. It all depends on developmental issue, maturity, and the psychological and emotional makeup of that child. Several factors must be taken into account, says Gallagher. “The ability to follow parent guidelines, the child’s level of comfort in handling such situations, and a child’s general judgment should be weighed.”
　　Gallagher agrees with Skenazy that many nine-year-olds are ready for independence like taking public transportation alone. “At certain times of the day, on certain routes, the subways are generally safe for these children, especially if they have grown up in the city and have been taught how to be safe, how to obtain help if they are concerned for their safety, and how to avoid unsafe situations by being watchful and on their toes.”
　　But even with more traffic and fewer sidewalks, modern parents do have one advantage their parents didn’t: the cell phone. Being able to check in with a child anytime goes a long way toward relieving parental anxiety and may help parents loosen their control a little sooner. Skenazy got a lot of criticism because she didn’t give her kid her cell phone because she thought he’d lose it and wanted him to learn to go it alone without depending on mom—a major principle of free-range parenting. But most parents are more than happy to use cell phones to keep track of their kids.
　　And for those who like the idea of free-range kids but still struggle with their inner helicopter parent, there may be a middle way. A new generation of GPS cell phones with tracking software make it easier than ever to follow a child’s every movement via the Internet—without seeming to interfere or hover. Of course, when they go to college, they might start objecting to being monitored as they’re on parole (假释).

Part IV	 Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)      (25 minutes）
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.　　
　　There is nothing new about TV and fashion magazines giving girls unhealthy ideas about how thin they need to be in order to be considered beautiful. What is surprising is the method psychologists at the University of Texas have come up with to keep girls from developing eating disorders. Their main weapon against super skinny (role) models: a brand of civil disobedience dubbed “body activism.”
　　Since 2001, more than 1,000 high school and college students in the U.S. have participated in the Body Project, which works by getting girls to understand how they have been buying into the notion that you have to be thin to be happy or successful. After critiquing (评论) the so-called thin ideal by writing essays and role-playing with their peers, participants are directed to come up with and execute small, nonviolent acts. They include slipping notes saying “Love your body the way it is” into dieting books at stores like Borders and writing letters to Mattel, makers of the impossibly proportioned Barbie doll.
　　According to a study in the latest issue of the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, the risk of developing eating disorders was reduced 61% among Body Project participants. And they continued to exhibit positive body-image attitudes as long as three years after completing the program, which consists, of four one-hour sessions. Such lasting effects may be due to girls’ realizing not only how they were being influenced but also who was benefiting from the societal pressure to be thin. “These people who promote the perfect body really don’t care about you at all,” says Kelsey Hertel, a high school junior and Body Project veteran in Eugene, Oregon. “They purposefully make you feel like less of a person so you’ll buy their stuff and they’ll make money.”

Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D] You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.

　　For hundreds of millions of years, turtles (海龟) have struggled out of the sea to lay their eggs on sandy beaches, long before there were nature documentaries to celebrate them, or GPS satellites and marine biologists to track them, or volunteers to hand-carry the hatchlings (幼龟) down to the water’s edge lest they become disoriented by headlights and crawl towards a motel parking lot instead. A formidable wall of bureaucracy has been erected to protect their prime nesting on the Atlantic coastlines. With all that attention paid to them, you’d think these creatures would at least have the gratitude not to go extinct.
　　But Nature is indifferent to human notions of fairness, and a report by the Fish and Wildlife Service showed a worrisome drop in the populations of several species of North Atlantic turtles, notably loggerheads, which can grow to as much as 400 pounds. The South Florida nesting population, the largest, has declined by 50% in the last decade, according to Elizabeth Griffin, a marine biologist with the environmental group Oceana. The figures prompted Oceana to petition the government to upgrade the level of protection for the North Atlantic loggerheads from “threatened” to “endangered”—meaning they are in danger of disappearing without additional help.
　　Which raises the obvious question: what else do these turtles want from us, anyway? It turns out, according to Griffin, that while we have done a good job of protecting the turtles for the weeks they spend on land (as egg-laying females, as eggs and as hatchlings), we have neglected the years spend in the ocean. “The threat is from commercial fishing,” says Griffin. Trawlers (which drag large nets through the water and along the ocean floor) and long line fishers (which can deploy thousands of hooks on lines that can stretch for miles) take a heavy toll on turtles. 
　　Of course, like every other environmental issue today, this is playing out against the background of global warming and human interference with natural ecosystems. The narrow strips of beach on which the turtles lay their eggs are being squeezed on one side by development and on the other by the threat of rising sea levels as the oceans warm. Ultimately we must get a handle on those issues as well, or a creature that outlived the dinosaurs (恐龙) will meet its end at the hands of humans, leaving our descendants to wonder how creature so ugly could have won so much affection.

　　D．warn our descendants about the extinction of species
Passage Two Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　There are few more sobering online activities than entering data into college-tuition calculators and gasping as the Web spits back a six-figure sum. But economists say families about to go into debt to fund four years of partying, as well as studying, can console themselves with the knowledge that college is an investment that, unlike many bank stocks, should yield huge dividends.
　　A 2008 study by two Harvard economists notes that the “labor-market premium to skill”—or the amount college graduates earned that’s greater than what high-school graduate earned—decreased for much of the 20th century, but has come back with a vengeance (报复性地) since the 1980s. In 2005, The typical full-time year-round U.S. worker with a four-year college degree earned $50,900, 62% more than the $31,500 earned by a worker with only a high-school diploma.
　　There’s no question that going to college is a smart economic choice. But a look at the strange variations in tuition reveals that the choice about which college to attend doesn’t come down merely to dollars and cents. Does going to Columbia University (tuition, room and board $49,260 in 2007-08) yield a 40% greater return than attending the University of Colorado at Boulder as an out-of-state student ($35,542)? Probably not. Does being an out-of-state student at the University of Colorado at Boulder yield twice the amount of income as being an in-state student ($17,380) there? Not likely.
　　No, in this consumerist age, most buyers aren’t evaluating college as an investment, but rather as a consumer product—like a car or clothes or a house. And with such purchases, price is only one of many crucial factors to consider.
　　As with automobiles, consumers in today’s college marketplace have vast choices, and people search for the one that gives them the most comfort and satisfaction in line with their budgets. This accounts for the willingness of people to pay more for different types of experiences (such as attending a private liberal-arts college or going to an out-of-state public school that has a great marine-biology program). And just as two auto purchasers might spend an equal amount of money on very different cars, college students (or, more accurately, their parents) often show a willingness to pay essentially the same price for vastly different products. So which is it? Is college an investment product like a stock or a consumer product like a car? In keeping with the automotive world’s hottest consumer trend, maybe it’s best to characterize it as a hybrid (混合动力汽车); an expensive consumer product that, over time, will pay rich dividends.

Bosses Say “Yes” to Home Work
　　  Rising costs of office space, time lost to stressful commuting, and a slow recognition that workers have lives beyond the office—all are strong arguments for letting staff work from home.
　　  For the small business, there are additional benefits too—staff are more productive, and happier, enabling firms to keep their headcounts (员工数) and their recruitment costs to a minimum. It can also provide competitive advantage, especially when small businesses want to attract new staff but don’t have the budget to offer huge salaries.
　　  While company managers have known about the benefits for a long time, many have done little about it, skeptical of whether they could trust their employees to work to full capacity without supervision, or concerned about the additional expenses teleworking policies might incur as staff start charging their home phone bills to the business.
　　  Yet this is now changing. When communications provider Inter-Tel researched the use of remote working solutions among small and medium sized UK businesses in April this year, it found that 28% more companies claimed to have introduced flexible working practices than a year ago.
　　  The UK network of Business Links confirms that it too has seen a growing interest in remote working solutions from small businesses seeking its advice, and claims that as many as 60-70% of the businesses that come through its doors now offer some form of remote working support to their workforces.
　　  Technology advances, including the widespread availability of broadband, are making the introduction of remote working a piece of cake.
　　  “If systems are set up properly, staff can have access to all the resources they have in the office wherever they have an internet connection,” says Andy Poulton, e-business advisor at Business Link for Berkshire and Wiltshire. “There are some very exciting developments which have enabled this.”
　　  One is the availability of broadband everywhere, which now covers almost all of the country (BT claims that, by July, 99.8% of its exchanges will be broadband enabled, with alternative plans in place for even the most remote exchanges). “This is the enabler,” Poulton says.
　　  Yet while broadband has come down in price too, those service providers targeting the business market warn against consumer services masquerading (伪装) as business friendly broadband.
　　  “Broadband is available for as little as ￡15 a month, but many businesses fail to appreciate the hidden costs of such a service,” says Neil Stephenson, sales and marketing director at Onyx Internet, an internet service provider based in the northeast of England. “Providers offering broadband for rock bottom prices are notorious for poor service, with regular breakdowns and heavily congested (拥堵的) networks. It is always advisable for businesses to look beyond the price tag and look for a business only provider that can offer more reliability, with good support.” Such services don’t cost too much—quality services can be found for upwards of ￡30 a month.
　　  The benefits of broadband to the occasional home worker are that they can access email in real time, and take full advantage of services such as internet based backup or even internet based phone services.
　　  Internet based telecoms, or VoIP (Voice over IP) to give it its technical title, is an interesting tool to any business supporting remote working. Not necessarily because of the promise of free or reduced price phone calls (which experts point out is misleading for the average business), but because of the sophisticated voice services that can be exploited by the remote worker—facilities such as voicemail and call forwarding, which provide a continuity of the company image for customers and business partners.
　　  By law, companies must “consider seriously” requests to work flexibly made by a parent with a child under the age of six, or a disabled child under 18. It was the need to accommodate employees with young children that motivated accountancy firm Wright Vigar to begin promoting teleworking recently. The company, which needed to upgrade its IT infrastructure (基础设施) to provide connectivity with a new, second office, decided to introduce support for remote working at the same time.
　　  Marketing director Jack O Hern explains that the company has a relatively young workforce, many of whom are parents: “One of the triggers was when one of our tax managers returned from maternity leave. She was intending to work part time, but could only manage one day a week in the office due to childcare. By offering her the ability to work from home, we have doubled her capacity—now she works a day a week from home, and a day in the office. This is great for her, and for us as we retain someone highly qualified.”
　　  For Wright Vigar, which has now equipped all of its fee earners to be able to work at maximum productivity when away from the offices (whether that’s from home, or while on the road), this strategy is not just about saving on commute time or cutting them loose from the office, but enabling them to work more flexible hours that fit around their home life.
　　  O’Hern says: “Although most of our work is client-based and must fit around this, we can’t see any reason why a parent can’t be on hand to deal with something important at home, if they have the ability to complete a project later in the day.”
　　  Supporting this new way of working came with a price, though. Although the firm was updating its systems anyway, the company spent 10-15% more per user to equip them with a laptop rather than a PC, and about the same to upgrade to a server that would enable remote staff to connect to the company networks and access all their usual resources.
　　  Although Wright Vigar hasn’t yet quantified the business benefits, it claims that, in addition to being able to retain key staff with young families, it is able to save fee-earners a substantial amount of “dead” time in their working days.
　　  That staff can do this without needing a fixed telephone line provides even more efficiency savings. “With Wi-Fi (fast, wireless internet connections) popping up all over the place, even on trains, our fee-earners can be productive as they travel, and between meetings, instead of having to kill time at the shops,” he adds.
　　  The company will also be able to avoid the expense of having to relocate staff to temporary offices for several weeks when it begins disruptive office renovations soon.
　　  Financial recruitment specialist Lynne Hargreaves knows exactly how much her firm has saved by adopting a teleworking strategy, which has involved handing her company’s data management over to a remote hosting company, Dataset, so it can be accessible by all the company’s consultants over broadband internet connections.
　　  It has enabled the company to dispense with its business premises altogether, following the realization that it just didn’t need them any more. “The main motivation behind adopting home working was to increase my own productivity, as a single mum to an 11yearold,” says Hargreaves. “But I soon realised that, as most of our business is done on the phone, email and at offsite meetings, we didn’t need our offices at all. We’re now saving ￡16,000 a year on rent, plus the cost of utilities, not to mention what would have been spent on commuting.”

In the ancient world, a trained memory was an (37) asset, particularly in public life. There were no (38)  devices for taking notes, and early Greek orators(演说家) delivered long speeches with great (39)  because they learned the speeches using mnemonic systems.
　　  The Greeks discovered that human memory is (40) an associative process—that it works by linking things together. For example, think of an apple. The (41) your brain registers the word “apple”, it (42) the shape, color, taste, smell and (43)  of that fruit. All these things are associated in your memory with the word “apple”.
　　  (44) . An example could be when you think about a lecture you have had. This could trigger a memory about what you’re talking about through that lecture, which can then trigger another memory.
　　  (45) . An example given on a website I was looking at follows: Do you remember the shape of Austria, Canada, Belgium, or Germany? Probably not. What about Italy, though? (46) . You made an association with something already known, the shape of a boot, and Italy’s shape could not be forgotten once you had made the association.
Part IV		Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)			(25 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
　　  Many countries have made it illegal to chat into a hand-held mobile phone while driving. But the latest research further confirms that the danger lies less in what a motorist’s hands do when he takes a call than in what the conversation does to his brain. Even using a “hands-free” device can divert a driver’s attention to an alarming extent.
　　  Melina Kunar of the University of Warwick and Todd Horowitz of the Harvard Medical School ran a series of experiments in which two groups of volunteers had to pay attention and respond to a series of moving tasks on a computer screen that were reckoned equivalent in difficulty to driving. One group was left undistracted while the other had to engage in a conversation using a speakerphone. As Kumar and Horowitz report, those who were making the equivalent of a hands-free call had an average reaction time 212 milliseconds slower than those who were not. That, they calculate, would add 5.7 metres to the braking distance of a car travelling at 100kph. They also found that the group using the hands-free kit made 83% more errors in their tasks than those who were not talking.
　　  To try to understand more about why this was, they tried two further tests. In one, members of a group were asked simply to repeat words spoken by the caller. In the other, they had to think of a word that began with the last letter of the word they had just heard. Those only repeating words performed the same as those with no distraction, but those with the more complicated task showed even worse reaction times—an average of 480 milliseconds extra delay. This shows that when people have to consider the information they hear carefully, it can impair their driving ability significantly.
　　  Punishing people for using handheld gadgets while driving is difficult enough, even though they can be seen from outside the car. Persuading people to switch their phones off altogether when they get behind the wheel might be the only answer. Who knows, they might even come to enjoy not having to take calls.
47.	Carrying on a mobile phone conversation while one is driving is considered dangerous because it seriously distracts _______________________.
48.	In the experiments, the two groups of volunteers were asked to handle a series of moving tasks which were considered _______________________.
49.	Results of the experiments show that those who were making the equivalent of a hands-free call took _______________________ to react than those who were not.
50.	Further experiments reveal that participants tend to respond with extra delay if they are required to do _______________________.
51.	The author believes persuasion, rather than _______________________, might be the only way to stop people from using mobile phones while driving.

　　  There is nothing like the suggestion of a cancer risk to scare a parent, especially one of the over-educated, eco-conscious type. So you can imagine the reaction when a recent USA Today investigation of air quality around the nation’s schools singled out those in the smugly（自鸣得意的）green village of Berkeley, Calif., as being among the worst in the country. The city’s public high school, as well as a number of daycare centers, preschools, elementary and middle schools, fell in the lowest 10%. Industrial pollution in our town had supposedly turned students into living science experiments breathing in a laboratory’s worth of heavy metals like manganese, chromium and nickel each day. This in a city that requires school cafeterias to serve organic meals. Great, I thought, organic lunch, toxic campus.
　　  Since December, when the report came out, the mayor, neighborhood activists（活跃分子）and various parent-teacher associations have engaged in a fierce battle over its validity: over the guilt of the steel-casting factory on the western edge of town, over union jobs versus children’s health and over what, if anything, ought to be done. With all sides presenting their own experts armed with conflicting scientific studies, whom should parents believe? Is there truly a threat here, we asked one another as we dropped off our kids, and if so, how great is it? And how does it compare with the other, seemingly perpetual health scares we confront, like panic over lead in synthetic athletic fields? Rather than just another weird episode in the town that brought you protesting environmentalists, this latest drama is a trial for how today’s parents perceive risk, how we try to keep our kids safe—whether it’s possible to keep them safe—in what feels like an increasingly threatening world. It raises the question of what, in our time, “safe” could even mean.
　　  “There’s no way around the uncertainty,” says Kimberly Thompson, president of Kid Risk, a nonprofit group that studies children’s health. “That means your choices can matter, but it also means you aren’t going to know if they do.” A 2004 report in the journal Pediatrics explained that nervous parents have more to fear from fire, car accidents and drowning than from toxic chemical exposure. To which I say: Well, obviously. But such concrete hazards are beside the point. It’s the dangers parents can’t—and may never—quantify that occur all of sudden. That’s why I’ve rid my cupboard of microwave food packed in bags coated with a potential cancer-causing substance, but although I’ve lived blocks from a major fault line(地质断层) for more than 12 years, I still haven’t bolted our bookcases to the living room wall.

　　C) They didn’t know who to believe.      	D) They weren’t convinced of the results.
55. What is the view of the 2004 report in the journal Pediatrics?

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　  Crippling health care bills, long emergency-room waits and the inability to find a primary care physician just scratch the surface of the problems that patients face daily.
　　  Primary care should be the backbone of any health care system. Countries with appropriate primary care resources score highly when it comes to health outcomes and cost. The U.S. takes the opposite approach by emphasizing the specialist rather than the primary care physician.
　　  A recent study analyzed the providers who treat Medicare beneficiaries（老年医保受惠人）. The startling finding was that the average Medicare patient saw a total of seven doctors—two primary care physicians and five specialists—in a given year. Contrary to popular belief, the more physicians taking care of you don’t guarantee better care. Actually, increasing fragmentation of care results in a corresponding rise in cost and medical errors.
　　  How did we let primary care slip so far? The key is how doctors are paid. Most physicians are paid whenever they perform a medical service. The more a physician does, regardless of quality or outcome, the better he’s reimbursed (返还费用). Moreover, the amount a physician receives leans heavily toward medical or surgical procedures. A specialist who performs a procedure in a 30minute visit can be paid three times more than a primary care physician using that same 30 minutes to discuss a patient’s disease. Combine this fact with annual government threats to indiscriminately cut reimbursements; physicians are faced with no choice but to increase quantity to boost income.
　　  Primary care physicians who refuse to compromise quality are either driven out of business or to cash-only practices, further contributing to the decline of primary care.
　　  Medical students are not blind to this scenario. They see how heavily the reimbursement deck is stacked against primary care. The recent numbers show that since 1997, newly graduated U.S. medical students who choose primary care as a career have declined by 50%. This trend results in emergency rooms being overwhelmed with patients without regular doctors.
　　  How do we fix this problem?
　　  It starts with reforming the physician reimbursement system. Remove the pressure for primary care physicians to squeeze in more patients per hour, and reward them for optimally (最佳地) managing their diseases and practicing evidence-based medicine. Make primary care more attractive to medical students by forgiving student loans for those who choose primary care as a career and reconciling the marked difference between specialist and primary care physician salaries.
　　  We’re at a point where primary care is needed more than ever. Within a few years, the first wave of the 76 million Baby Boomers will become eligible for Medicare. Patients older than 85, who need chronic care most, will rise by 50% this decade.
　　  Who will be there to treat them?
57. The author’s chief concern about the current U.S. health care system is .
　　A) the inadequate training of physicians       	B) the declining number of doctors
　　C) the shrinking primary care resources        	D) the ever-rising health care costs
58. We learn from the passage that people tend to believe that .
　　A) the more costly the medicine, the more effective the cure
　　B) seeing more doctors may result in more diagnostic errors
　　C) visiting doctors on a regular basis ensures good health
　　D) the more doctors taking care of a patient, the better
59. Faced with the government threats to cut reimbursements indiscriminately, primary care physicians have to .
　　A) increase their income by working overtime    	B) improve their expertise and service
　　C) make various deals with specialists          	D) see more patients at the expense of quality
60. Why do many new medical graduates refuse to choose primary care as their career?
　　A) They find the need for primary care declining.
　　B) The current system works against primary care.
　　C) Primary care physicians command less respect.
　　D) They think working in emergency rooms tedious.
61. What suggestion does the author give in order to provide better health care?
　　A) Bridge the salary gap between specialists and primary care physicians.
　　B) Extend primary care to patients with chronic diseases.
　　C) Recruit more medical students by offering them loans.
　　D) Reduce the tuition of students who choose primary care as their major.

　　  McDonald’s, Greggs, KFC and Subway are today named as the most littered brands in England as Keep Britain Tidy called on fast-food companies to do more to tackle customers who drop their wrappers and drinks cartons (盒子) in the streets.
　　  Phil Barton, chief executive of Keep Britain Tidy, 62  its new Dirty Pig campaign, said it was the first time it had investigated which  63  made up “littered England” and the same names appeared again and again. “We  64  litterers for

Obviously we ask all our customers to dispose of litter responsibly.” Trials of more extensive, all-day litter patrols were  74  in Manchester and Birmingham. 
　　KFC said it took its  75  on litter management “very seriously”, and would introduce a programme to reduce packaging  76  many products.

范文1
Should Parents Send Their Kids to Art Classes 
　　Children are the future of the nation, the pearl in their parents’ eyes. Hoping that their kids can become the cream of the crop among others, more and more parents send their kids to various art classes to let them learn more. However, people hold different opinions toward this phenomenon. 
　　Some people hold a firm position that it is a beneficial thing for kids to attend art classes. There, kids can not only learn some art skills that may helpful for them someday, they can also get a chance to expand their interests to a great extent, and their minds can also be broadened. Besides, kids can also make a lot of friends there, thus their communication skills may also be sharpened. While for the others, they hold an opposite opinion. They think parents should not send their kids to art classes blindly against kids’ will, because this will get a definitely negative impact on kids. Kids, in these parents’ eyes, should be given more flexible time to relax and do whatever they are interested in. And kids also need freedom because unacceptable art classes will absolutely eliminate the nature of kids. Thus, sending kids to these classes will undoubtedly hurt them. 
　　Every coin has two sides. As far as I am concerned, I think children’s interests should be taken into careful consideration before being sent to art classes. Children should be given enough freedom to develop by themselves. Whether parents should send their kids to art classes, it depends. 
范文2
Should parents send their kids to art classes? 
　　With the development of our society and economy, parents become more concerned about the future competition of children , so more and more parents manage kinds of ways to enhance the ability of children in every aspects , like they sent their children to art class after school or at weekends in order to promise their kids a more competitive future. 
　　The majority parents have the above view on this issue, believing it is a good way to cultivate the children’s interests and hobbies, paving their future path in life .while there are also some people who think that this will give kids heavy burden, not really good for their growth. 
　　In my opinion, we should respect our kids and do something to child's own interests and hobbies rather than blindness. Second, do not give too much pressure on kids, giving them a healthy environment for growth is much more than attending art classes.
范文3
Should parents send their kids to art classes? 
　　Nowadays，it has been common that parents send their kids to various art classes such as music, drawing dancing ,etc. at weekend or during holiday. 
　　Some people take it for granted and think through this method, their kids can make use of leisure time to learn more skills and be prepared for the future fierce competition in the adult world. Nevertheless, there are still some sounds against this phenomenon, saying that it shouldn’t be encouraged. 
　　As far as I’m concerned, I stand by the latter side, because its disadvantages far outweigh than the advantages. Above all, for children, play is their nature. It will do great harm to both their physical and mental health if they are deprived of the right to have enough free time. For another thing, most kids are sent to art schools to learn thing they are not even interested in. Consequently, they will be reluctant to cooperate with the teachers resulting only in the waste of time and energy. Thus, obviously, it is better to set children free to do things in which they passion actually lies, rather than forcing then to go to art classes.

　　Wilma Subra had no intention of becoming a public speaker. After graduating from college with degrees in chemistry and microbiology, she went to work at Gulf South Research Institute in Louisiana. As part of her job, she conducted field research on toxic substances in the environment, often in minority communities located near large industrial polluters. She found many families were being exposed to high, sometimes deadly levels of chemicals and other toxic substances. But she was not allowed to make her information public. Frustrated by these restrictions, Subra left her job in 1981, created her own company and has devoted the past two decades to helping people fight back against giant industrial polluters. She works with families and community groups to conduct environmental tests and hybrid test results, and organize for change. Because of her efforts, dozens of toxic sites across the country have been cleaned up. And one chemical industry spokesperson calls her “a top gun” for the environmental movement. How has Subra achieved all this? Partly through her scientific training, partly through her commitment to environmental justice. But just as important is her ability to communicate with people through public speaking. “Public speaking,” she says, “is the primary vehicle I use for reaching people。” If you had asked Subra before 1981, do you see yourself as a major public speaker? She would have laughed at the idea. Yet today she gives more than one hundred presentations a year. Along the way, she’s lectured at Harvard, testified before congress, and addressed audiences in 40 states, as well as in Mexico, Canada, and Japan。

　　Passage 2
　　One of the biggest challenges facing employers and educators today is the rapid advance of globalization. The market place is no longer national or regional, but extends to all corners of the world. And this requires a global-ready workforce. Universities have a large part to play in preparing students for the 21st century labor market by promoting international educational experiences. The most obvious way universities can help develop a global workforce is by encouraging students to study abroad as part of their course. Students who have experienced another culture firsthand are more likely to be global-ready when they graduate. Global workforce development doesn’t always have to involve travel abroad, however. If students learn another language and study other cultures, they will be more global-ready when they graduate. It is important to point out that students also need to have a deep understanding of their own culture before they can begin to observe, analyze and evaluate other cultures. In multi-cultural societies, people can study each other’s cultures to develop intercultural competencies, such as critical and reflective thinking and intellectual flexibility. This can be done both through the curriculum and through activities on campus outside of the classroom, such as art exhibitions and lectures from international experts. Many universities are already embracing this challenge and providing opportunities for students to become global citizens. Students themselves, however, may not realize that when they graduate, they will be competing in a global labor market. And universities need to raise awareness of these issues amongst undergraduates。

　　Passage 3 
　　To see if hair color affects a person’s chances of getting a job, researchers at California State University asked 136 college students to review the resume and photograph of a female applicant for a job as an accountant. Each student was given the same resume but the applicant’s picture was altered so that in some photos, her hair was golden, in some red and in some brown. The result-----with brown hair, the woman was rated more capable and she was offered a higher salary than when she had a golden or red hair. Other studies have found similar results. Many respondents rate women with golden hair as less intelligent than other people and red hair as more temperamental. Women with red or golden hair are victims of the common practice of stereotyping. A stereotype is a simplistic or exaggerated image that human carries in their minds about groups of people. For example, lawyers are shrewd and dishonest is a popular stereotype. Stereotyping can occur in public speaking classes when trying to choose a speech topic. Some males think that women are uninterested in how to repair cars or some females think that men are uninterested in creative hobbies, such as knitting a needlepoint. We should reject to stereotypes because they force all people in a group into the same simple pattern. They fail to account for individual differences and the wide range of characteristics among members of any group. Some lawyers are dishonest, yes, but many are not. Some women are uninterested in repairing cars, yes, but some are enthusiastic with mechanics。 
　　Questions 33 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard。 
　　Q33. What did researchers at California State University find? 
　　Q34. What is the popular stereotype of lawyers? 
　　Q35.Why does the speaker say we should reject to stereotypes? 
Section C
The ancient Greeks developed basic memory systems called mnemonics. The name is derived from their Goddess of memory "Mnemosyne". In the ancient world, a trained memory was an immense asset, particularly in public life. There were no convenient devices for taking notes, and early Greek orators delivered long speeches with great accuracy because they learned the speeches using mnemonic systems. 
The Greeks discovered that human memory is largely an associative process that it works by linking things together. For example, think of an apple. The instant your brain registers the word "apple", it recalls the shape, color, taste, smell and texture of that fruit. All these things are associated in your memory with the word "apple". This means that any thought about a certain subject will often bring up more memories that are related to it. An example could be when you think about a lecture you have had. This could trigger a memory about what you're talking about through that lecture, which can then trigger another memory. Associations do not have to be logical. They just have to make a good link. An example given on a website I was looking at follows, "Do you remember the shape of Austria? Canada? Belgium? Or Germany? Probably not. What about Italy though? If you remember the shape of Italy, it is because you have been told at some time that Italy is shaped like a boot. You made an association with something already known, the shape of a boot. And Italy shape could not be forgotten once you had made the association.

Obama's success isn't all good news for black Americans
    As Erin White watched the election results head towards victory for Barack Obama, she felt a burden lifting from her shoulders. "In that one second, it was a validation for my whole race," she recalls.
    "I've always been an achiever," says White, who is studying for an MBA at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. "But there had always been these things in the back of my mind questioning whether I really can be who I want. It was like a shadow, following me around saying you can only go so far. Now it's like a barrier has been let down."
    White's experience is what many psychologists had expected - that Obama would prove to be a powerful role model for African Americans. Some hoped his rise to prominence would have a big impact on white Americans, too, challenging those who still harbour racist sentiments. "The traits that characterise him are very contradictory to the racial stereotypes that black people are aggressive and uneducated," says Ashby Plant of Florida State University. "He's very intelligent and eloquent."
Sting in the tail
    Ashby Plant is one of a number of psychologists who seized on Obama's candidacy to test hypotheses about the power of role models. Their work is already starting to reveal how the "Obama effect" is changing people's views and behaviour. Perhaps surprisingly, it is not all good news: there is a sting in the tail of the Obama effect.
    But first the good news. Barack Obama really is a positive role model for African Americans, and he was making an impact even before he got to the White House. Indeed, the Obama effect can be surprisingly immediate and powerful, as Ray Friedman of Vanderbilt University and his colleagues discovered.
    They tested four separate groups at four key stages of Obama's presidential campaign. Each group consisted of around 120 adults of similar age and education, and the test assessed their language skills. At two of these stages, when Obama's success was less than certain, the tests showed a clear difference between the scores of the white and black participants—an average of 12.1 out of 20, compared to 8.8, for example. When the Obama fever was at its height, however, the black participants performed much better. Those who had watched Obama's acceptance speech as the Democrats' presidential candidate performed just as well, on average, as the white subjects.After his election victory, this was true of all the black participants.
Dramatic shift
    What can explain this dramatic shift? At the start of the test, the participants had to declare their race and were told their results would be used to assess their strengths and weaknesses. This should have primed the subjects with "stereotype threat" – an anxiety that their results will confirm negative stereotypes, which has been shown to damage the performance of African Americans.
    Obama's successes seemed to act as a shield against this. "We suspect they felt inspired and energised by his victory, so the stereotype threat wouldn't prove a distraction," says Friedman.
Lingering racism
    If the Obama effect is positive for African Americans, how is it affecting their white compatriots (同胞)? Is the experience of having a charismatic (有魅力的) black president modifying lingering racist attitudes? There is no easy way to measure racism directly; instead psychologists assess what is known as "implicit bias", using a computer-based test that measures how quickly people associate positive and negative words—such as "love" or "evil"—with photos of black or white faces. A similar test can also measure how quickly subjects associate stereotypical traits—such as athletic skills or mental ability—with a particular group.
    In a study that will appear in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Plant's team tested 229 students during the height of the Obama fever. They found that implicit bias has fallen by as much as 90% compared with the level found in a similar study in 2006. "That's an unusually large drop," Plant says.
    While the team can't be sure their results are due solely to Obama, they also showed that those with the lowest bias were likely to subconsciously associate black skin colour with political words such as "government" or "president". This suggests that Obama was strongly on their mind, says Plant.
Drop in bias
    Brian Nosek of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, who runs a website that measures implicit bias using similar test, has also observed a small drop in bias in the 700,000 visitors to the site since January 2007, which might be explained by Obama's rise to popularity. However, his preliminary results suggest that change will be much slower coming than Plant's results suggest.
Talking honestly
    "People now have the opportunity of expressing support for Obama every day," says Daniel Effron at Stanford University in California. "Our research arouses the concern that people may now be more likely to raise negative views of African Americans." On the other hand, he says, it may just encourage people to talk more honestly about their feelings regarding race issues, which may not be such a bad thing.
    Another part of the study suggests far more is at stake than the mere expression of views. The Obama effect may have a negative side. Just one week after Obama was elected president, participants were less ready to support policies designed to address racial inequality than they had been two weeks before the election. Huge obstacles
    It could, of course, also be that Obama's success helps people to forget that a disproportionate number of black Americans still live in poverty and face huge obstacles when trying to overcome these circumstances. "Barack Obama's family is such a salient (出色的) image, we generalise it and fail to see the larger picture—that there's injustice in every aspect of American life," says Cheryl Kaiser of the University of Washington in Seattle. Those trying to address issues of racial inequality need to constantly remind people of the inequalities that still exist to counteract the Obama's effect, she says.
    Though Plant's findings were more positive, she too warns against thinking that racism and racial inequalities are no longer a problem. "The last thing I want is for people to think everything's solved."
    These findings do not only apply to Obama, or even just to race. They should hold for any role model in any country. "There's no reason we wouldn't have seen the same effect on our views of women if Hillary Clinton or Sarah Palin had been elected," says Effron. So the election of a female leader might have a downside for other women.
Beyond race
    We also don't yet know how long the Obama effect—both its good side and its bad—will last.Political sentiment is notoriously changeable: What if things begin to go wrong for Obama, and his popularity slumps?
    And what if Americans become so familiar with having Obama as their president that they stop considering his race altogether? "Over time he might become his own entity," says Plant. This might seem like the ultimate defeat for racism, but ignoring the race of certain select individuals—a phenomenon that psychologists call subtyping—also has an insidious (隐伏的) side. "We think it happens to help people preserve their beliefs, so they can still hold on to the previous stereotypes." That could turn out to be the cruellest of all the twists to the Obama effect.

Part IV 		Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)			 (25 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
    Question: My ninth-grade art teacher doesn't give any grade above 94% because, she says, "There's always room for improvement." In previous years, I earned a 99% and a 100%. The 94 I received this term does not reflect the hard work that I put into this course. Because of her "improvement" theory, I got a lower grade than I deserve. Is her grading philosophy ethical (符合职业道德规范的)?
    Answer: Your teacher's grading system may be unwise, but it is not unethical. A teacher deserves wide latitude in selecting the method of grading that best promotes learning in her classroom; that is, after all, the prime function of grades. It is she who has the training and experience to make this decision. Assuming that your teacher is neither biased nor corrupt and that her system conforms to school rules, you can't fault her ethics.
    You can criticize her methodology. A 100 need not imply that there is no possibility of improvement, only that a student successfully completed the course work. A ninth grader could get a well-earned 100 in English class but still have a way to go before she writes as well as Jane Austen. What's more, grades are not only an educational device but are also part of a screening system to help assign kids to their next class or program. By capping her grades at 94 while most other teachers grade on a scale that tops out at 100, your teacher could jeopardize a student's chance of getting a scholarship or getting into a top college.
    What it is wrong to condemn her for is overlooking your hard work. You diligence is worthy of encouragement, but effort does not equal accomplishment. If scholars suddenly discovered that Rembrandt had dashed off "The Night Watch" in an afternoon, it would still be "The Night Watch."
    I could spend months sweating over my own "paintings", but I'd produce something you wouldn't want to hang in your living room. Or your garage.
    One feature of a good grading system is that those measured by it generally regard it as fair and reasonable—not the case here. Simmering (难以平息的) resentment is seldom an aid to education.And so your next step should be to discuss your concerns with your teacher or the principal.

47. The ninth-grader thought that his art teacher should have given him ______.
48. According to the answer, a teacher should have the freedom to ______ to encourage learning.

50. The example of Rembrandt's painting suggests that a distinction should be made between ______.
51. The ninth-grader is advised to go to his teacher or the principal to ______.
Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 51 to 56 are based on the following passage.
    Only two countries in the advanced world provide no guarantee for paid leave from work to care for a newborn child. Last spring one of the two, Australia, gave up the dubious distinction by establishing paid family leave starting in 2011. I wasn't surprised when this didn't make the news here in the United States—we're now the only wealthy country without such a policy.
    The United States does have one explicit family policy, the Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993. It entitles workers to as much as 12 weeks' unpaid leave for care of a newborn or dealing with a family medical problem. Despite the modesty of the benefit, the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups fought it bitterly, describing it as "government-run personnel management" and a "dangerous precedent". In fact, every step of the way, as (usually) Democratic leaders have tried to introduce work-family balance measures into the law, business groups have been strongly opposed.
    As Yale law professor Anne Alstott argues, justifying parental support depends on defining the family as a social good that, in some sense, society must pay for. In her book No Exit: What Parents Owe Their Children and What Society Owes Parents, she argues that parents are burdened in many ways in their lives: there is "no exit" when it comes to children. "Society expects—and needs—parents to provide their children with continuity of care, meaning the intensive, intimate care that human beings need to develop their intellectual, emotional and moral capabilities. And society expects—and needs—parents to persist in their roles for 18 years, or longer if needed."
    While most parents do this out of love, there are public penalties for not providing care. What parents do, in other words, is of deep concern to the state, for the obvious reason that caring for children is not only morally urgent but essential for the future of society. The state recognizes this in the large body of family laws that govern children' welfare, yet parents receive little help in meeting the life-changing obligations society imposes. To classify parenting as a personal choice for which there is no collective responsibility is not merely to ignore the social benefits of good parenting; really, it is to steal those benefits because they accrue (不断积累) to the whole of society as today's children become tomorrow's productive citizenry (公民). In fact, by some estimates, the value of parental investments in children, investments of time and money (including lost wages), is equal to 20-30% of gross domestic product. If these investments generate huge social benefits—as they clearly do—the benefits of providing more social support for the family should be that much clearer.

    B) The fail to provide enough support for parents
    C) They emphasize parents' legal responsibilities.
    D) They impose the care of children on parents.

    A) It is regarded as a legal obligation.
    B) It relies largely on social support.
    C) It generates huge social benefits.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 62 are based on the following passage.
    A new study from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University shows that today's youth vote in larger numbers than previous generations, and a 2008 study from the Center for American Progress adds that increasing numbers of young voters and activists support traditionally liberal causes. But there's no easy way to see what those figures mean in real life. During the presidential campaign, Barack Obama assembled a racially and ideologically diverse coalition with his message of hope and change; as the reality of life under a new administration settles in, some of those supporters might become disillusioned. As the nation moves further into the Obama presidency, will politically engaged young people continue to support the president and his agenda, or will they gradually drift away?
    The writers of Generation O (short for Obama), a new Newsweek blog that seeks to chronicle the lives of a group of young Obama supporters, want to answer that question. For the next three months, Michelle Kremer and 11 other Obama supporters, ages 19 to 34, will blog about life across mainstream America, with one twist: by tying all of their ideas and experiences to the new president and his administration, the bloggers will try to start a conversation about what it means to be young and politically active in America today. Malena Amusa, a 24-year-old writer and dancer from St. Louis sees the project as a way to preserve history as it happens. Amusa, who is traveling to India this spring to finish a book, then to Senegal to teach English, has ongoing conversations with her friends about how the Obama presidency has changed their daily lives and hopes to put some of those ideas, along with her global perspective, into her posts. She's excited because, as she puts it, "I don't have to wait [until] 15 years from  now" to make sense of the world.
    Henry Flores, a political-science professor at St. Mary's University, credits this younger generation's political strength to their embrace of technology. "[The Internet] exposes them to more thinking," he says, "and groups that are like-minded in different parts of the country start to come together." That's exactly what the Generation O bloggers are hoping to do. The result could be a group of young people that, like their boomer (二战后生育高峰期出生的美国人) parents, grows up with a strong sense of purpose and sheds the image of apathy (冷漠) they've inherited from Generation X (60 年代后期和70 年代出生的美国人). It's no small challenge for a blog run by a group of ordinary—if ambitious—young people, but the members of Generation O are up to the task.

Into the Unknown
　　　The world has never seen population ageing before. Can it cope?
　　Until the early 1990s nobody much thought about whole populations getting older. The UN had the foresight to convene a “world assembly on ageing” back in 1982, but that came and went. By 1994 the World Bank had noticed that something big was happening. In a report entitled “Averting the Old Age Crisis”, it argued that pension arrangements in most countries were unsustainable.
　　For the next ten years a succession of books, mainly by Americans, sounded the alarm. They had titles like Young vs Old, Gray Dawn and The Coming Generational Storm, and their message was blunt: health-care systems were heading for the rocks, pensioners were taking young people to the cleaners, and soon there would be intergenerational warfare.
　　Since then the debate has become less emotional, not least because a lot more is known about the subject. Books, conferences and research papers have multiplied. International organisations such as the OECD and the EU issue regular reports. Population ageing is on every agenda, from G8 economic conferences to NATO summits. The World Economic Forum plans to consider the future of pensions and health care at its prestigious Davos conference early next year. The media, including this newspaper, are giving the subject extensive coverage.
　　Whether all that attention has translated into sufficient action is another question. Governments in rich countries now accept that their pension and health-care promises will soon become unaffordable, and many of them have embarked on reforms, but so far only timidly. That is not surprising: politicians with an eye on the next election will hardly rush to introduce unpopular measures that may not bear fruit for years, perhaps decades.
　　The outline of the changes needed is clear. To avoid fiscal (财政) meltdown, public pensions and health-care provision will have to be reined back severely and taxes may have to go up. By far the most effective method to restrain pension spending is to give people the opportunity to work longer, because it increases tax revenues and reduces spending on pensions at the same time. It may even keep them alive longer. John Rother, the AARP’s head of policy and strategy, points to studies showing that other things being equal, people who remain at work have lower death rates than their retired peers.
　　Younger people today mostly accept that they will have to work for longer and that their pensions will be less generous. Employers still need to be persuaded that older workers are worth holding on to. That may be because they have had plenty of younger ones to choose from, partly thanks to the post-war baby-boom and partly because over the past few decades many more women have entered the labour force, increasing employers’ choice. But the reservoir of women able and willing to take up paid work is running low, and the baby-boomers are going grey.
　　In many countries immigrants have been filling such gaps in the labour force as have already emerged (and remember that the real shortage is still around ten years off). Immigration in the developed world is the highest it has ever been, and it is making a useful difference. In still-fertile America it currently accounts for about 40% of total population growth, and in fast-ageing western Europe for about 90%.
　　On the face of it, it seems the perfect solution. Many developing countries have lots of young people in need of jobs; many rich countries need helping hands that will boost tax revenues and keep up economic growth. But over the next few decades labour forces in rich countries are set to shrink so much that inflows of immigrants would have to increase enormously to compensate: to at least twice their current size in western Europe’s most youthful countries, and three times in the older ones. Japan would need a large multiple of the few immigrants it has at present. Public opinion polls show that people in most rich countries already think that immigration is too high. Further big increases would be politically unfeasible.
　　To tackle the problem of ageing populations at its root, “old” countries would have to rejuvenate (使年轻) themselves by having more of their own children. A number of them have tried, some more successfully than others. But it is not a simple matter of offering financial incentives or providing more child care. Modern urban life in rich countries is not well adapted to large families. Women find it hard to combine family and career. They often compromise by having just one child.
　　And if fertility in ageing countries does not pick up? It will not be the end of the world, at least not for quite a while yet, but the world will slowly become a different place. Older societies may be less innovative and more strongly disinclined to take risks than younger ones. By 2025 at the latest, about half the voters in America and most of those in western European countries will be over 50—and older people turn out to vote in much greater number than younger ones. Academic studies have found no evidence so far that older voters have used their power at the ballot box to push for policies that specifically benefit them, though if in future there are many more of them they might start doing so.
　　Nor is there any sign of the intergenerational warfare predicted in the 1990s. After all, older people themselves mostly have families. In a recent study of parents and grown-up children in 11 European countries, Karsten Hank of Mannheim University found that 85% of them lived within 25km of each other and the majority of them were in touch at least once a week.
　　Even so, the shift in the centre of gravity to older age groups is bound to have a profound effect on societies, not just economically and politically but in all sorts of other ways too. Richard Jackson and Neil Howe of America’s CSIS, in a thoughtful book called The Graying of the Great Powers, argue that, among other things, the ageing of the developed countries will have a number of serious security implications.
　　For example, the shortage of young adults is likely to make countries more reluctant to commit the few they have to military service. In the decades to 2050, America will find itself playing an ever-increasing role in the developed world’s defence effort. Because America’s population will still be growing when that of most other developed countries is shrinking, America will be the only developed country that still matters geopolitically (地缘政治上).
　　Ask me in 2020
　　There is little that can be done to stop population ageing, so the world will have to live with it. But some of the consequences can be alleviated. Many experts now believe that given the right policies, the effects, though grave, need not be catastrophic. Most countries have recognised the need to do something and are beginning to act.
　　But even then there is no guarantee that their efforts will work. What is happening now is historically unprecedented. Ronald Lee, director of the Centre on the Economics and Demography of Ageing at the University of California, Berkeley, puts it briefly and clearly: “We don’t really know what population ageing will be like, because nobody has done it yet. “

Part IV	 Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)      (25 minutes）
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
　　Most young boys are trained to believe that men should be strong, tough, cool, and detached. Thus, they learn early to hide vulnerable emotions such as love, joy, and sadness because they believe that such feelings are feminine and imply weakness. Over time, some men become strangers to their own emotional lives. It seems that men with traditional views of masculinity are more likely to suppress outward emotions and to fear emotions, supposedly because such feelings may lead to a loss of composure (镇定). Keep in mind, however, that this view is challenged by some researchers. As with many gender gaps, differences in emotionality tend to be small, inconsistent, and dependent on the situation. For instance, Robertson and colleagues found that males who were more traditionally masculine were more emotionally expressive in a structured exercise than when they were simply asked to talk about their emotions.
　　Males’ difficulty with “tender” emotions has serious consequences. First, suppressed emotions can contribute to stress-related disorders. And worse, men are less likely than women to seek help from health professionals. Second, men’s emotional inexpressiveness can cause problems in their relationships with partners and children. For example, men who endorse traditional masculine norms report lower relationship satisfaction, as do their female partners. Further, children whose fathers are warm, loving, and accepting toward them have higher self-esteem and lower rates of aggression and behavior problems. On a positive note, fathers are increasingly involving themselves with their children. And 30 percent of fathers report that they take equal or greater responsibility for their children than their working wives do.
　　One emotion males are allowed to express is anger. Sometimes this anger translates into physical aggression or violence. Men commit nearly 90 percent of violent crimes in the United States and almost all sexual assaults.

　　In the early 20th century, few things were more appealing than the promise of scientific knowledge. In a world struggling with rapid industrialization, science and technology seemed to offer solutions to almost every problem. Newly created state colleges and universities devoted themselves almost entirely to scientific, technological, and engineering fields. Many Americans came to believe that scientific certainty could not only solve scientific problems, but also reform politics, government, and business. Two world wars and a Great Depression rocked the confidence of many people that scientific expertise alone could create a prosperous and ordered world. After World War Ⅱ, the academic world turned with new enthusiasm to humanistic studies, which seemed to many scholars the best way to ensure the survival of democracy. American scholars fanned out across much of the world—with support from the Ford Foundation, the Fulbright program, etc.—to promote the teaching of literature and the arts in an effort to make the case for democratic freedoms.
　　In the America of our own time, the great educational challenge has become an effort to strengthen the teaching of what is now known as the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and math). There is considerable and justified concern that the United States is falling behind much of the rest of the developed world in these essential disciplines. India, China, Japan, and other regions seem to be seizing technological leadership.
　　At the same time, perhaps inevitably, the humanities—while still popular in elite colleges and universities—have experienced a significant decline. Humanistic disciplines are seriously underfunded, not just by the government and the foundations but by academic institutions themselves. Humanists are usually among the lowest-paid faculty members at most institutions and are often lightly regarded because they do not generate grant income and because they provide no obvious credentials (资质) for most nonacademic careers.
　　Undoubtedly American education should train more scientists and engineers. Much of the concern among politicians about the state of American universities today is focused on the absence of “real world” education—which means preparation for professional and scientific careers. But the idea that institutions or their students must decide between humanities and science is false. Our society could not survive without scientific and technological knowledge. But we would be equally impoverished (贫困的) without humanistic knowledge as well. Science and technology teach us what we can do. Humanistic thinking helps us understand what we should do.
　　It is almost impossible to imagine our society without thinking of the extraordinary achievements of scientists and engineers in building our complicated world. But try to imagine our world as well without the remarkable works that have defined our culture and values. We have always needed, and we still need, both.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　Will there ever be another Einstein? This is the undercurrent of conversation at Einstein memorial meetings throughout the year. A new Einstein will emerge, scientists say. But it may take a long time. After all, more than 200 years separated Einstein from his nearest rival, Isaac Newton.
　　Many physicists say the next Einstein hasn’t been born yet, or is a baby now. That’s because the quest for a unified theory that would account for all the forces of nature has pushed current mathematics to its limits. New math must be created before the problem can be solved.
　　But researchers say there are many other factors working against another Einstein emerging anytime soon.
　　For one thing, physics is a much different field today. In Einstein’s day, there were only a few thousand physicists worldwide, and the theoreticians who could intellectually rival Einstein probably would fit into a streetcar with seats to spare.
　　Education is different, too. One crucial aspect of Einstein’s training that is overlooked is the years of philosophy he read as a teenager—Kant, Schopenhauer and Spinoza, among others. It taught him how to think independently and abstractly about space and time, and it wasn’t long before he became a philosopher himself.
　　“The independence created by philosophical insight is—in my opinion—the mark of distinction between a mere artisan (工匠) or specialist and a real seeker after truth,” Einstein wrote in 1944.
　　And he was an accomplished musician. The interplay between music and math is well known. Einstein would furiously play his violin as a way to think through a knotty physics problem.
　　Today, universities have produced millions of physicists. There aren’t many jobs in science for them, so they go to Wall Street and Silicon Valley to apply their analytical skills to more practical—and rewarding—efforts.
　　“Maybe there is an Einstein out there today,” said Columbia University physicist Brian Greene, “but it would be a lot harder for him to be heard.”
　　Especially considering what Einstein was proposing.
　　“The actual fabric of space and time curving? My God, what an idea!” Greene said at a recent gathering at the Aspen Institute. “It takes a certain type of person who will bang his head against the wall because you believe you’ll find the solution.”
　　Perhaps the best examples are the five scientific papers Einstein wrote in his “miracle year” of 1905. These “thought experiments” were pages of calculations signed and submitted to the prestigious journal Annalen der Physik by a virtual unknown. There were no footnotes or citations.
　　What might happen to such a submission today?
　　“We all get papers like those in the mail,” Greene said. “We put them in the junk file.”

57.What do scientists seem to agree upon, judging from the first two paragraphs?
　 [A] Einstein pushed mathematics almost to its limits.
　 [B] It will take another Einstein to build a unified theory.
　 [C] No physicist is likely to surpass Einstein in the next 200 years.
　 [D] It will be some time before a new Einstein emerges.
58. What was critical to Einstein’s success?
   [A] His talent as an accomplished musician.
   [B] His independent and abstract thinking.
　 [C] His untiring effort to fulfill his potential.
　 [D] His solid foundation in math theory.
59. What does the author tell us about physicists today?
　 [A] They tend to neglect training in analytical skills.
 　[B] They are very good at solving practical problems.
 　[C] They attach great importance to publishing academic papers.
 　[D] They often go into fields yielding greater financial benefits.
60. What does Brian Greene imply by saying “... it would be a lot harder for him to be heard” (Lines  1-2, Para. 9)?
　 [A] People have to compete in order to get their papers published.
　 [B] It is hard for a scientist to have his papers published today.
　 [C] Papers like Einstein’s would unlikely get published today.
　 [D] Nobody will read papers on apparently ridiculous theories.
61. When he submitted his papers in 1905, Einstein _______.
   [A] forgot to make footnotes and citations
   [B] was little known in academic circles
   [C] was known as a young genius in math calculations
　 [D] knew nothing about the format of academic papers

Minority Report
　　　American universities are accepting more minorities than ever. Graduating them is another matter.
　　　Barry Mills, the president of Bowdoin College, was justifiably proud of Bowdoin's efforts to recruit minority students. Since 2003 the small, elite liberal arts school in Brunswick, Maine, has boosted the proportion of so-called under-represented minority students in entering freshman classes from 8% to 13%. "It is our responsibility to reach out and attract students to come to our kinds of places," he told a NEWSWEEK reporter. But Bowdoin has not done quite as well when it comes to actually graduating minorities. While 9 out of 10 white students routinely get their diplomas within six years, only 7 out of 10 black students made it to graduation day in several recent classes.
　　　"If you look at who enters college, it now looks like America," says Hilary Pennington, director of postsecondary programs for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has closely studied enrollment patterns in higher education. "But if you look at who walks across the stage for a diploma, it's still largely the white, upper-income population."
　　　The United States once had the highest graduation rate of any nation. Now it stands 10th. For the first time in American history, there is the risk that the rising generation will be less well educated than the previous one. The graduation rate among 25- to 34-year-olds is no better than the rate for the 55- to 64-year-olds who were going to college more than 30 years ago. Studies show that more and more poor and non-white students want to graduate from college – but their graduation rates fall far short of their dreams. The graduation rates for blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans lag far behind the graduation rates for whites and Asians. As the minority population grows in the United States, low college graduation rates become a threat to national prosperity.
　　　The problem is pronounced at public universities. In 2007 the University of Wisconsin-Madison – one of the top five or so prestigious public universities – graduated 81% of its white students within six years, but only 56% of its blacks. At less-selective state schools, the numbers get worse. During the same time frame, the University of Northern Iowa graduated 67% of its white students, but only 39% of its blacks. Community colleges have low graduation rates generally – but rock-bottom rates for minorities. A recent review of California community colleges found that while a third of the Asian students picked up their degrees, only 15% of African-Americans did so as well.
　　　Private colleges and universities generally do better, partly because they offer smaller classes and more personal attention. But when it comes to a significant graduation gap, Bowdoin has company. Nearby Colby College logged an 18-point difference between white and black graduates in 2007 and 25 points in 2006. Middlebury College in Vermont, another top school, had a 19-point gap in 2007 and a 22-point gap in 2006. The most selective private schools – Harvard, Yale, and Princeton – show almost no gap between black and white graduation rates. But that may have more to do with their ability to select the best students. According to data gathered by Harvard Law School professor Lain Gainer, the most selective schools are more likely to choose blacks who have at least one immigrant parent from Africa or the Caribbean than black students who are descendants of American slaves.
　　　"Higher education has been able to duck this issue for years, particularly the more selective schools, by saying the responsibility is on the individual student," says Pennington of the Gates Foundation. "If they fail, it's their fault." Some critics blame affirmative action – students admitted with lower test scores and grades from shaky high schools often struggle at elite schools. But a bigger problem may be that poor high schools often send their students to colleges for which they are "under matched": they could get into more elite, richer schools, but instead go to community colleges and low-rated state schools that lack the resources to help them. Some schools out for profit cynically increase tuitions and count on student loans and federal aid to foot the bill – knowing full well that the students won't make it. "The school keeps the money, but the kid leaves with loads of debt and no degree and no ability to get a better job. Colleges are not holding up their end," says Amy Wilkins of the Education Trust.
　　　A college education is getting ever more expensive. Since 1982 tuitions have been rising at roughly twice the rate of inflation. In 2008 the net cost of attending a four-year public university – after financial aid – equaled 28% of median (中间的)family income, while a four-year private university cost 76% of median family income. More and more scholarships are based on merit, not need. Poorer students are not always the best-informed consumers. Often they wind up deeply in debt or simply unable to pay after a year or two and must drop out.
　　　There once was a time when universities took pride in their dropout rates. Professors would begin the year by saying, "Look to the right and look to the left. One of you is not going to be here by the end of the year." But such a Darwinian spirit is beginning to give way as at least a few colleges face up to the graduation gap. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the gap has been roughly halved over the last three years. The university has poured resources into peer counseling to help students from inner-city schools adjust to the rigor (严格要求)and faster pace of a university classroom –and also to help minority students overcome the stereotype that they are less qualified. Wisconsin has a "laser like focus" on building up student skills in the first three months, according to vice provost (教务长)Damon Williams.
　　　State and federal governments could sharpen that focus everywhere by broadly publishing minority graduation rates. For years private colleges such as Princeton and MIT have had success bringing minorities onto campus in the summer before freshman year to give them some prepare Tory courses. The newer trend is to start recruiting poor and non-white students as early as the seventh grade, using innovative tools to identify kids with sophisticated verbal skills. Such programs can be expensive, of course, but cheap compared with the millions already invested in scholarships and grants for kids who have little chance to graduate without special support.
　　　With effort and money, the graduation gap can be closed. Washington and Lee is a small, selective school in Lexington, Va. Its student body is less than 5% black and less than 2% Latino. While the school usually graduated about 90% of its whites, the graduation rate of its blacks and Latinos had dipped to 63% by 2007. "We went through a dramatic shift," says Dawn Watkins, the vice president for student affairs. The school aggressively pushed mentoring (辅导) of minorities by other students and "partnering" with parents at a special pre-enrollment session. The school had its first-ever black homecoming. Last spring the school graduated the same proportion of minorities as it did whites. If the United States wants to keep up in the global economic race, it will have to pay systematic attention to graduating minorities, not just enrolling them.

Part IV     Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)      (25 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
　　　How good are you at saying "no"? For many, it's surprisingly difficult. This is especially true of editors, who by nature tend to be eager and engaged participants in everything they do. Consider these scenarios:
　　　It's late in the day. That front-page package you've been working on is nearly complete; one last edit and it's finished. Enter the executive editor, who makes a suggestion requiring a more-than-modest rearrangement of the design and the addition of an information box. You want to scream: "No! It's done!" What do you do?
　　　The first rule of saying no to the boss is doing say no. She probably has something in mind when she makes suggestions, and it's up to you to find out what. The second rule is doing raise the stakes by challenging her authority. That issue is already decided. The third rule is to be ready to cite options and consequences. The boss's suggestions might be appropriate, but there are always consequences. She might not know about the pages backing up that need attention, or about the designer who had to go home sick. Tell her she can have what she wants, but explain the consequences. Understand what she's trying to accomplish and propose a Plan B that will make it happen without destroying what you've done so far.
　　　Here's another case. Your least-favorite reporter suggests a dumb story idea. This one should be easy, but it's not. If you say no, even politely, you risk inhibiting further ideas, not just from that reporter, but from others who heard that you turned down the idea. This scenario is common in newsrooms that lack a systematic way to filter story suggestions.
　　　Two steps are necessary. First, you need a system for how stories are proposed and reviewed. Reporters can tolerate rejection of their ideas if they believe they were given a fair hearing. Your gut reaction (本能反应) and dismissive rejection, even of a worthless idea, might not qualify as systematic or fair.
　　　Second, the people you work with need to negotiate a "What if ...?" agreement covering "What if my idea is turned down?" How are people expected to react? Is there an appeal process? Can they refine the idea and resubmit it? By anticipating "What if...?" situations before they happen, you can reach understanding that will help ease you out of confrontations.
47.Instead of directly saying no to your boss, you should find out __________.
48.The author's second warning is that we should avoid running a greater risk by __________.
49. One way of responding to your boss's suggestion is to explain the __________ to her and offer an alternative solution.
50.To ensure fairness to reporters, it is important to set up a system for stories to __________.
51.People who learn to anticipate "What if...?" situations will be able to reach understanding and avoid __________.
Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　　At the heart of the debate over illegal immigration lies one key question: are immigrants good or bad for the economy? The American public overwhelmingly thinks they're bad. Yet the consensus among most economists is that immigration, both legal and illegal, provides a small net boost to the economy. Immigrants provide cheap labor, lower the prices of everything from farm produce to new homes, and leave consumers with a little more money in their pockets. So why is there such a discrepancy between the perception of immigrants' impact on the economy and the reality?
　　　There are a number of familiar theories. Some argue that people are anxious and feel threatened by an inflow of new workers. Others highlight the strain that undocumented immigrants place on public services, like schools, hospitals, and jails. Still others emphasize the role of race, arguing that foreigners add to the nation's fears and insecurities. There's some truth to all these explanations, but they aren't quite sufficient.
　　　To get a better understanding of what's going on; consider the way immigration's impact is felt. Though its overall effect may be positive, its costs and benefits are distributed unevenly. David Card, an economist at UC Berkeley, notes that the ones who profit most directly from immigrants' low-cost labor are businesses and employers – meatpacking plants in Nebraska, for instance, or agricultural businesses in California. Granted, these producers' savings probably translate into lower prices at the grocery store, but how many consumers make that mental connection at the checkout counter? As for the drawbacks of illegal immigration, these, too, are concentrated. Native low-skilled workers suffer most from the competition of foreign labor. According to a study by George Boras, a Harvard economist, immigration reduced the wages of American high-school dropouts by 9% between 1980-2000.
　　　Among high-skilled, better-educated employees, however, opposition was strongest in states with both high numbers of immigrants and relatively generous social services. What worried them most, in other words, was the fiscal (财政的)burden of immigration. That conclusion was reinforced by another finding: that their opposition appeared to soften when that fiscal burden decreased, as occurred with welfare reform in the 1990s, which curbed immigrants' access to certain benefits.
　　　The irony is that for all the overexcited debate, the net effect of immigration is minimal. Even for those most acutely affected – say, low-skilled workers, or California residents – the impact isn't all that dramatic. "The unpleasant voices have tended to dominate our perceptions," says Daniel Michener, a political science professor at the University of Oregon. "But when all those factors are put together and the economists calculate the numbers, it ends up being a net positive, but a small one." Too bad most people don't realize it.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　　Picture a typical MBA lecture theatre twenty years ago. In it the majority of students will have conformed to the standard model of the time: male, middle class and Western. Walk into a class today, however, and you'll get a completely different impression. For a start, you will now see plenty more women – the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for example, boasts that 40% of its new enrolment is female. You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country.
　　　It might be tempting, therefore, to think that the old barriers have been broken down and equal opportunity achieved. But, increasingly, this apparent diversity is becoming a mask for a new type of conformity. Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future.
　　　Diversity, it seems, has not helped to address fundamental weaknesses in business leadership. So what can be done to create more effective managers of the commercial world? According to Valerie Gauthier, associate dean at HEC Paris, the key lies in the process by which MBA programmers recruit their students. At the moment candidates are selected on a fairly narrow set of criteria such as prior academic and career performance, and analytical and problem solving abilities. This is then coupled to a school's picture of what a diverse class should look like, with the result that passport, ethnic origin and sex can all become influencing factors. But schools rarely dig down to find out what really makes an applicant succeed, to create a class which also contains diversity of attitude and approach – arguably the only diversity that, in a business context, really matters.
　　　Professor Gauthier believes schools should not just be selecting candidates from traditional sectors such as banking, consultancy and industry. They should also be seeking individuals who have backgrounds in areas such as political science, the creative arts, history or philosophy, which will allow them to put business decisions into a wider context.
　　　Indeed, there does seem to be a demand for the more rounded leaders such diversity might create. A study by Manna, a leadership development company, suggests that, while the bully-boy chief executive of old may not have been eradicated completely, there is a definite shift in emphasis towards less tough styles of management – at least in America and Europe. Perhaps most significant, according to Manna, is the increasing interest large companies have in more collaborative management models, such as those prevalent in Scandinavia, which seek to integrate the hard and soft aspects of leadership and encourage delegated responsibility and accountability.

58. What is the author's concern about current business school education?

	B)  Applicants with sound knowledge in math and statistics.

Google's Plan for World's Biggest Online Library: Philanthropy Or Act of Piracy?
　　　In recent years, teams of workers dispatched by Google have been working hard to make digital copies of books. So far, Google has scanned more than 10 million titles from libraries in America and Europe - including half a million volumes held by the Bodleian in Oxford. The exact method it uses is unclear; the company does not allow outsiders to observe the process.
　　　Why is Google undertaking such a venture? Why is it even interested in all those out-of-printlibrary books, most of which have been gathering dust on forgotten shelves for decades? Thecompany claims its motives are essentially public-spirited. Its overall mission, after all, is to "organise the world's information", so it would be odd if that information did not include books.
　　　The company likes to present itself as having lofty aspirations. "This really isn't about making money. We are doing this for the good of society." As Santiago de la Mora, head of Google Books for Europe, puts it: "By making it possible to search the millions of books that exist today, we hope to expand the frontiers of human knowledge."
　　　Dan Clancy, the chief architect of Google Books, does seem genuine in his conviction that this is primarily a philanthropic (慈善的) exercise. "Google's core business is search and find, so obviously what helps improve Google's search engine is good for Google," he says. "But we have never built a spreadsheet (电子数据表) outlining the financial benefits of this, and I have never had to justify the amount I am spending to the company's founders."
　　　It is easy, talking to Clancy and his colleagues, to be swept along by their missionary passion. But Google's book-scanning project is proving controversial. Several opponents have recently emerged, ranging from rival tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon to small bodies representing authors and publishers across the world. In broad terms, these opponents have levelled two sets of criticisms at Google.
　　　First, they have questioned whether the primary responsibility for digitally archiving the world's books should be allowed to fall to a commercial company. In a recent essay in the New York Review of Books, Robert Darnton, the head of Harvard University's library, argued that because such books are a common resource – the possession of us all – only public, not-for-profit bodies should be given the power to control them.
　　　The second related criticism is that Google's scanning of books is actually illegal. This allegation has led to Google becoming mired in (陷入) a legal battle whose scope and complexity makes the Jarndyce and Jarndyce case in Charles Dickens' Bleak House look straightforward.
　　　At its centre, however, is one simple issue: that of copyright. The inconvenient fact about most books, to which Google has arguably paid insufficient attention, is that they are protected by copyright. Copyright laws differ from country to country, but in general protection extends for the duration of an author's life and for a substantial period afterwards, thus allowing the author's heirs to benefit. (In Britain and America, this post-death period is 70 years.) This means, of course, that almost all of the books published in the 20th century are still under copyright – and the last century saw more books published than in all previous centuries combined. Of the roughly 40 million books in US libraries, for example, an estimated 32 million are in copyright. Of these, some 27 million are out of print.
　　　Outside the US, Google has made sure only to scan books that are out of copyright and thus in the "public domain" (works such as the Bodleian's first edition of Middlemarch, which anyone can read for free on Google Books Search).
But, within the US, the company has scanned both in-copyright and out-of-copyright works. In its defence, Google points out that it displays only small segments of books that are in copyright– arguing that such displays are "fair use". But critics allege that by making electronic copies of these books without first seeking the permission of copyright holders, Google has committed piracy.
　　　"The key principle of copyright law has always been that works can be copied only once authors have expressly given their permission," says Piers Blofeld, of the Sheil Land literary agency in London. "Google has reversed this – it has simply copied all these works without bothering toask."
　　　In 2005, the Authors Guild of America, together with a group of US publishers, launched a class action suit (集团诉讼) against Google that, after more than two years of negotiation, ended with an announcement last October that Google and the claimants had reached an out-of-court settlement. The full details are complicated - the text alone runs to 385 pages– and trying to sum arise it is no easy task. "Part of the problem is that it is basically incomprehensible," says Blofeld, one of the settlement's most vocal British critics.
　　　Broadly, the deal provides a mechanism for Google to compensate authors and publishers whose rights it has breached (including giving them a share of any future revenue it generates from their works). In exchange for this, the rights holders agree not to sue Google in future.
　　　This settlement hands Google the power - but only with the agreement of individual rights holders – to exploit its database of out-of-print books. It can include them in subscription deals sold to libraries or sell them individually under a consumer licence. It is these commercial provisions that are proving the settlement's most controversial aspect.
　　　Critics point out that, by giving Google the right to commercially exploit its database, the settlement paves the way for a subtle shift in the company's role from provider of information to seller. "Google's business model has always been to provide information for free, and sell advertising on the basis of the traffic this generates," points out James Grimmelmann, associate professor at New York Law School. Now, he says, because of the settlement's provisions, Google could become a significant force in bookselling.
　　　Interest in this aspect of the settlement has focused on "orphan" works, where there is noknown copyright holder – these make up an estimated 5-10% of the books Google has scanned. Under the settlement, when no rights holders come forward and register their interest in a work, commercial control automatically reverts to Google. Google will be able to display up to 20% of orphan works for free, include them in its subscription deals to libraries and sell them to individual buyers under the consumer licence.
　　　It is by no means certain that the settlement will be enacted (执行) – it is the subject of a fairness hearing in the US courts. But if it is enacted, Google will in effect be off the hook as far as copyright violations in the US are concerned. Many people are seriously concerned by this - and the company is likely to face challenges in other courts around the world.
　　　No one knows the precise use Google will make of the intellectual property it has gained by scanning the world's library books, and the truth, as Gleick, an American science writer and member of the Authors Guild, points out, is that the company probably doesn't even know itself. But what is certain is that, in some way or other, Google's entrance into digital bookselling will have a significant impact on the book world in the years to come.

Part IV  Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth) (25 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
　　　Leadership is the most significant word in today's competitive business environment because it directs the manager of a business to focus inward on their personal capabilities and style. Experts on leadership will quickly point out that "how things get done" influences the success of the outcomes and indicates a right way and a wrong way to do things. When a noted leader on the art of management, Peter Drucker, coined the phrase "Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things," he was seeking to clarify the distinctions he associates with the terms.
　　　When Stephen Covey, founder and director of the Leadership Institute, explored leadership styles in the past decade, he focused on the habits of a great number of highly effective individuals. His Seven Habits of Highly Effective People became a popular bestseller very quickly. His ideas forced a reexamination of the early leadership paradigm (范例), which he observed centered on traits found in the character ethic and the personality ethic. The former ethic suggested success was founded on integrity, modesty, loyalty, courage, patience, and so forth. The personality ethic suggested it was one's attitude, not behavior, that inspired success, and this ethic was founded on a belief of positive mental attitude. In contrast to each of these ideas, Covey advocates that leaders need to understand universal principles of effectiveness, and he highlights how vital it is for leaders to first personally manage themselves if they are to enjoy any hope of outstanding success in their work environments. To achieve a desired vision for your business, it is vital that you have a personal vision of where you are headed and what you value. Business leadership means that managers need to "put first things first," which implies that before leading others, you need to be clear on your own values, abilities, and strengths and be seen as trustworthy.

Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　　What's the one word of advice a well-meaning professional would give to a recent college graduate? China"} India! Brazil! How about trade!
　　　When the Commerce Department reported last week that the trade deficit in June approached $50 billion, it set off a new round of economic doom saying. Imports, which soared to $200.3 billion in the month, are subtracted in the calculation of gross domestic product. The larger the trade deficit, the smaller the GDP. Should such imbalances continue, pessimists say, they could contribute to slower growth.
　　　But there's another way of looking at the trade data. Over the past two years, the figures on imports and exports seem not to signal a double-dip recession – a renewed decline in the broad level of economic activity in the United States – but an economic expansion.
　　　The rising volume of trade – more goods and services shuttling in and out of the United States – is good news for many sectors. Companies engaged in shipping, trucking, rail freight, delivery,
and logistics (物流) have all been reporting better than expected results. The rising numbers signify growing vitality in foreign markets – when we import more stuff, it puts more cash in the hands of people around the world, and U.S. exports are rising because more foreigners have the ability to buy the things we produce and market. The rising tide of trade is also good news for people who work in trade-sensitive businesses, especially those that produce commodities for which global demand sets the price – agricultural goods, mining, metals, oil.
　　　And while exports always seem to lag, U.S. companies are becoming more involved in the global economy with each passing month. General Motors sells as many cars in China as in America each month. While that may not do much for imports, it does help GM's balance sheet – and hence makes the jobs of U.S.-based executives more stable.
　　　One great challenge for the U.S. economy is slack domestic consumer demand. Americans are
paying down debt, saving more, and spending more carefully. That's to be expected, given what we've been through. But there's a bigger challenge. Can U.S.-based businesses, large and small, figure out how to get a piece of growing global demand? Unless you want to pick up and move to India, or Brazil, or China, the best way to do that is through trade. It may seem obvious, but it's no longer enough simply to do business with our friends and neighbors here at home.
　　　Companies and individuals who don't have a strategy to export more, or to get more involved in foreign markets, or to play a role in global trade, are shutting themselves out of the lion's share of economic opportunity in our world.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　　A recurring criticism of the UK's university sector is its perceived weakness in translating new knowledge into new products and services.
　　　Recently, the UK National Stem Cell Network warned the UK could lose its place among the world leaders in stem cell research unless adequate funding and legislation could be assured. We should take this concern seriously as universities are key in the national innovation system.
　　　However, we do have to challenge the unthinking complaint that the sector does not do enough in taking ideas to market. The most recent comparative data on the performance of universities and research institutions in Australia, Canada, USA and UK shows that, from a relatively weak starting position, the UK now leads on many indicators of commercialisation activity.
　　　When viewed at the national level, the policy interventions of the past decade have helped transform the performance of UK universities. Evidence suggests the UK's position is much stronger than in the recent past and is still showing improvement. But national data masks the very large variation in the performance of individual universities. The evidence shows that a large number of universities have fallen off the back of the pack, a few perform strongly and the rest chase the leaders.
　　　This type of uneven distribution is not peculiar to the UK and is mirrored across other economies. In the UK, research is concentrated: less than 25% of universities receive 75% of the research funding. These same universities are also the institutions producing the greatest share of PhD graduates, science citations, patents and licence income. The effect of policies generating long-term resource concentration has also created a distinctive set of universities which are research-led and commercially active. It seems clear that the concentration of research and commercialisation work creates differences between universities.
　　　The core objective for universities which are research-led must be to maximise the impact of their research efforts. These universities should be generating the widest range of social, economic and environmental benefits. In return for the scale of investment, they should share their expertise in order to build greater confidence in the sector.
　　　Part of the economic recovery of the UK will be driven by the next generation of research commercialisation spilling out of our universities. There are three dozen universities in the UK which are actively engaged in advanced research training and commercialisation work.
　　　If there was a greater coordination of technology transfer offices within regions and a simultaneous investment in the scale and functions of our graduate schools, universities could, and should, play a key role in positioning the UK for the next growth cycle.

57. What does the author think of UK universities in terms of commercialisation?
A)     They fail to convert knowledge into money.
B)      They do not regard it as their responsibility.
C)      They still have a place among the world leaders.
D)     They have lost their leading position in many ways.
58. What does the author say about the national data on UK universities' performance in commercialisation?
A)     It masks the fatal weaknesses of government policy.
B)      It does not rank UK universities in a scientific way.
C)      It does not reflect the differences among universities.
D)     It indicates their ineffective use of government resources.
59. We can infer from Paragraph 5 that "policy interventions" (Line 1, Para. 4) refers to _____.
A)     government aid to non-research-oriented universities
B)      compulsory cooperation between universities and industries

B)      Fully utilise their research to benefit all sectors of society.
C)      Generously share their facilities with those short of funds.
D)     Spread their influence among top research institutions.
61. How can the university sector play a key role in the UK's economic growth?
A)     By establishing more regional technology transfer offices.
B)      By asking the government to invest in technology transfer research.
C)      By promoting technology transfer and graduate school education.
D)     By increasing the efficiency of technology transfer agencies.

The Three-Year Solution
　　Hartwick College, a small liberal-arts school in upstate New York, makes New York, makes this offer to well prepared students: earn your undergraduate degree in three years instead of four, and save about 543,000—the amount of one year’s tuition and fees. A number of innovative colleges are making the same offer to students anxious about saving time and money. That’s both an opportunity and a warning for the best higher-education system in the world.
　　The United States has almost all of the world’s best universities. A recent Chinese survey ranks 35 American universities among the top 50, eight among the top 10. Our research universities have been the key to developing the competitive advantages that help Americans produce 25% of all the world’s wealth. In 2007, 623,805 of the world’s brightest students were attracted to American universities.
　　Yet, there are signs of peril (危险)within American higher education. U.S. colleges have to compete in the marketplace. Students may choose among 6,000 public, private, nonprofit, for profit, or religious institutions of higher learning. In addition, almost all of the 532 billion the federal government provides for university research is awarded competitively.
　　But many colleges and universities are stuck in the past. For instance, the idea of the fall-to-spring“school year”hasn’t changed much since before the American Revolution, when we were a summer stretch no longer makes sense. Former George Washington University president Stephen Trachtenberg estimates that a typical college uses its facilities for academic purposes a little more than half the calendar year.“While college facilities sit idle, they continue to generate maintenance expenses that contribute to the high cost of running a college,” he has written.
　　Within academic departments, tenure(终身职位)，combined with age-discrimination laws, makes faculty turnover—critical for a university to remain current in changing times—difficult. Instead of protecting speech and encouraging diversity and innovative thinking, the tenure system often stifles(压制)them: younger professors must win the approval of established colleagues for tenure, encouraging like-mindedness and sometimes inhibiting the free flow of ideas.
　　Meanwhile, tuition has soared, leaving graduating students with unprecedented loan debt. Strong campus presidents to manage these problems are becoming harder to find, and to keep. In fact, students now stay on campus almost as long as their presidents. The average amount of time students now take to complete an undergraduate degree has stretched to six years and seven months as students interrupted by work, inconvenienced by unavailable classes, or lured by one more football season find it hard to graduate.
　　Congress has tried to help students with college costs through Pell Grants and other forms of tuition support. But some of their fixes have made the problem worse. The stack of congressional regulations governing federal student grants and loans now stands twice as tall as I do. Filling out these forms consumes 7% of every tuition dollar.
　　For all of these reasons, some colleges like Hartwick are rethinking the old way of doing things and questioning decades-old assumptions about what a college degree means. For instance, why does it have to take four years to earn a diploma? This fall, 16 first-year students and four second-year students at Hartwick enrolled in the school’s new three year degree program. According to the college, the plan is designed for high-ability, highly motivated student who wish to save money or to move along more rapidly toward advanced degrees.
　　By eliminating that extra year, there year degree students save 25% in costs. Instead of taking 30 credits a year, these students take 40. During January, Hartwick runs a four week course during which students may earn three to four credits on or off campus, including a number of international sites. Summer courses are not required, but a student may enroll in them—and pay extra. Three year students get first crack at course registration. There are no changes in the number of courses professors teach or in their pay.
　　The three-year degree isn’t a new idea. Geniuses have always breezed through. Judson College, a 350-student institution in Alabama, has offered students a three-year option for 40 years. Students attend “short terms” in May and June to earn the credits required for graduation. Bates College in Maine and Ball State University in Indiana are among other colleges offering three-year options.
　　Changes at the high-school level are also helping to make it easier for many students to earn their undergraduate degrees in less time. One of five students arrives at college today with Advanced Placement (AP) credits amounting to a semester or more of college level work. Many universities, including large schools like the University of Texas, make it easy for these AP students to graduate faster.
　　For students who don’t plan to stop with an undergraduate degree, the three-year plan may have an even greater appeal. Dr. John Sergent, head of Vanderbilt University Medical School’s residency (住院医生) program, enrolled in Vanderbilt’s undergraduate college in 1959. He entered medical school after only three years as did four or five of his classmates.” My first year of medical school counted as my senior year, which meant I had to take three to four labs a week to get all my sciences in. I basically skipped my senior year,” says Sergent. He still had time to be a student senator and meet his wife.
　　There are, however, drawbacks to moving through school at such a brisk pace. For one, it deprives students of the luxury of time to roam (遨游) intellectually. Compressing everything into three years also leaves less time for growing up, engaging in extracurricular activities, and studying abroad. On crowded campuses it could mean fewer opportunities to get into a prized professor’s class. Iowa’s Waldorf College has graduated several hundred students in its three-year degree program, but it now phasing out the option. Most Waldorf students wanted the full four-year experience—academically, socially, and athletically. And faculty members will be wary of any change that threatens the core curriculum in the name of moving students into the workforce.
　　“Most high governmental officials seem to conceive of education in this light—as a way to ensure economic competitiveness and continued economic growth,” Derek Bok, former president of Harvard, told The Washington Post. “I strongly disagree with this approach.” Another risk: the new campus schedules might eventually produce less revenue for the institution and longer working hours for faculty members.
　　Adopting a three-year option will not come easily to most school. Those that wish to tackle tradition and make American campus more cost-conscious may find it easier to take Trachtenberg’s advice: open campuses year-round.“You could run two complete colleges, with two complete faculties,”he says.“That’s without cutting the length of students’ vacations, increasing class sizes, or requiring faculty to teach more.”
　　Whether they experiment with three-year degrees, offer year-round classes, challenge the tenure system—or all of the above—universities are slowly realizing that to stay competitive and relevant they must adapt to a rapidly changing world.
　　Expanding the three-year option may be difficult, but it may be less difficult than asking Congress for additional financial help, asking legislators for more state support, or asking students even higher tuition payments. Campuses willing to adopt convenient schedules along with more focused, less-expensive degrees may find that they have a competitive advantage in attracting bright, motivated students. These sorts of innovations can help American universities avoid the perils of success.

PartⅣ  Reading    Comprehension(Reading in Depth)     (25minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage.
　　In face of global warming, much effort has been focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a variety of strategies. But while much of the research and innovation has concentrated on finding less-polluting energy alternatives, it may be decades before clean technologies like wind and solar meet a significant portion of our energy needs.
　　In the meantime, the amount of CO2 in the air is rapidly approaching the limits proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). “As long as we’re consuming fossil fuels, we’re putting out CO2,”says Klaus Lackner, a geophysicist at Columbia, University” We cannot let the CO2 in the atmosphere rise indefinitely.”
　　That sense of urgency has increased interest in capturing and storing CO2, which the IPCC says could provide the more than 50% reduction in emissions thought needed to reduce global warming.“We see the potential for capture and storage to play an integral role in reducing emissions,” says Kim Corley, Shell’s senior advisor of CO2 and environmental affairs. That forward thinking strategy is gaining support. The U.S. Department of Energy recently proposed putting $1 billion into a new $2.4 billion coal-burning energy plant. The plant’s carbon-capture technologies would serve as a pilot project for other new coal-burning plants.
　　But what do you do with the gas once you’ve captured it? One option is to put it to new uses. Dakota Gasification of North Dakota captures CO2 at a plant that converts coal into synthetic natural gas. It then ships the gas 200 miles by pipeline to Canada, where it is pumped underground in oil recovery operations. In the Netherlands, Shell delivers CO2 to farmers who pipe it into their greenhouses, increasing their yield of fruits and vegetables.
　　However, scientists say that the scale of CO2 emissions will require vast amounts of long-term storage. Some propose storing the CO2 in coal mines or liquid storage in the ocean, Shell favors storing CO2 in deep geological structures such as saline(盐的) formations and exhausted oil and gas fields that exist throughout the world.

Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　As anyone who has tried to lose weight knows, realistic goal-setting generally produces the best results. That's partially because it appears people who set realistic goals actually work more efficiently, and exert more effort, to achieve those goals.
　　What's far less understood by scientists, however, are the potentially harmful effects of goal-setting.
　　Newspapers relay daily accounts of goal-setting prevalent in industries and businesses up and down both Wall Street and Main Street , yet there has been surprisingly little research on how the long-trumpeted practice of setting goals may have contributed to the current economic crisis , and unethical (不道德的)behavior in general.
　　“Goals are widely used and promoted as having really beneficial effects. And yet, the same motivation that can push people to exert more effort in a constructive way could also motivate people to be more likely to engage in unethical behaviors,” says Maurice Schweitzer, an associate professor at Penn’s Wharton School.
　　“It turns out there’s no economic benefit to just having a goal—you just get a psychological benefit” Schweitzer says. “But in many cases, goals have economic rewards that make them more powerful.”
　　A prime example Schweitzer and his colleagues cite is the 2004 collapse of energy-trading giant Enron, where managers used financial incentives to motivate salesmen to meet specific revenue goals. The problem, Schweitzer says, is the actual trades were not profitable.
　　Other studies have shown that saddling employees with unrealistic goals can compel them to lie, cheat or steal. Such was the case in the early 1990s when Sears imposed a sales quota on its auto repair staff. It prompted employees to overcharge for work and to complete unnecessary repairs on a companywide basis.
　　Schweitzer concedes his research runs counter to a very large body of literature that commends the many benefits of goal-setting. Advocates of the practice have taken issue with his team’s use of such evidence as news accounts to support his conclusion that goal-setting is widely over-prescribed
　　In a rebuttal (反驳) paper, Dr. Edwin Locke writes:“Goal-setting is not going away. Organizations cannot thrive without being focused on their desired end results any more than an individual can thrive without goals to provide a sense of purpose.”
　　But Schweitzer contends the “mounting causal evidence” linking goal-setting and harmful behavior should be studied to help spotlight issues that merit caution and further investigation. “Even a few negative effects could be so large that they outweigh many positive effects,” he says.
　　“Goal-setting does help coordinate and motivate people. My idea would be to combine that with careful oversight, a strong organizational culture, and make sure the goals that you use are going to be constructive and not significantly harm the organization,” Schweitzer says.
　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。
52. What message does the author try to convey about goal-setting?
　　A) Its negative effects have long been neglected.
　　B) The goal increase people’s work efficiency.
　　C) Its role has been largely underestimated.
　　D) The goals most people set are unrealistic.
53. What does Maurice Schweitzer want to show by citing the example of Enron?
　　A) Setting realistic goals can turn a failing business into success.
　　B) Businesses are less likely to succeed without setting realistic goals.
　　C) Financial incentives ensure companies meet specific revenue goals.
　　D) Goals with financial rewards have strong motivational power.
54. How did Sears’ goal-setting affect its employees?
　　A) They were obliged to work more hours to increase their sales.
　　B) They competed with one another to attract more customers.
　　C) They resorted to unethical practice to meet their sales quota.
　　D) They improved their customer service on a companywide basis.
55. What do advocates of goal-setting think of Schweitzer’s research?
　　A) Its findings are not of much practical value.
　　B) It exaggerates the side effects of goal-setting.
　　C) Its conclusion is not based on solid scientific evidence.
　　D) It runs counter to the existing literature on the subject.
56. What is Schweitzer’s contention against Edwin Locke?
　　A) The link between goal-setting and harmful behavior deserves further study.
　　B) Goal-setting has become too deep-rooted in corporate culture.
　　C) The positive effects of goal-setting outweigh its negative effects.
　　D) Studying goal-setting can throw more light on successful business practices.
Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　For most of the 20th century, Asia asked itself what it could learn from the modern, innovating West. Now the question must be reversed. What can the West’s overly indebted and sluggish (经济滞长的) nations learn from a flourishing Asia?
　　Just a few decades ago, Asia’s two giants were stagnating(停滞不前) under faulty economic ideologies. However, once China began embracing free-market reforms in the 1980s, followed by India in the 1990s, both countries achieved rapid growth. Crucially, as they opened up their markets, they balanced market economy with sensible government direction. As the Indian economist Amartya Sen has wisely said, “The invisible hand of the market has often relied heavily on the visible hand of government.”
　　Contrast this middle path with America and Europe, which have each gone ideologically over-board in their own ways. Since the 1980s, America has been increasingly clinging to the ideology of uncontrolled free markets and dismissing the role of government—following Ronald Regan’s idea that “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. “Of course, when the markets came crashing down in 2007, it was decisive government intervention that saved the day. Despite this fact, many Americans are still strongly opposed to “big government.”
　　If Americans could only free themselves from their antigovernment doctrine, they would begin to see that the America’s problems are not insoluble. A few sensible federal measures could put the country back on the right path. A simple consumption tax of, say, 5% would significantly reduce the country’s huge government deficit without damaging productivity. A small gasoline tax would help free America from its dependence on oil imports and create incentives for green energy development. In the same way, a significant reduction of wasteful agricultural subsidies could also lower the deficit. But in order to take advantage of these common-sense solutions, Americans will have to put aside their own attachment to the idea of smaller government and less regulation. American politicians will have to develop the courage to follow what is taught in all American public-policy schools: that there are good taxes and bad taxes. Asian countries have embraced this wisdom, and have built sound long-term fiscal (财政的) policies as a result.
　　Meanwhile, Europe has fallen prey to a different ideological trap: the belief that European governments would always have infinite resources and could continue borrowing as if there were no tomorrow. Unlike the Americans, who felt that the markets knew best, the Europeans failed to anticipate how the markets would react to their endless borrowing. Today, the European Union is creating a $580 billion fund to ward off sovereign collapse. This will buy the EU time, but it will not solve the bloc’s larger problem.
57. What has contributed to the rapid economic growth in China and India?
　　A) Copying western-style economic behavior.
　　B) Heavy reliance on the hand of government.
　　C) Timely reform of government at all levels.
　　D) Free market plus government intervention.
58. What does Ronald Reagan mean by saying “government is the problem” (line4, Para. 3)?
　　A) Many social evils are caused by wrong government policies.
　　B) Many social problems arise from government’s inefficiency.
　　C) Government action is key to solving economic problems.
　　D) Government regulation hinders economic development.
59. What stopped the American economy from collapsing in 2007?
　　A) Self-regulatory repair mechanisms of the free market.
　　B) Cooperation between the government and businesses.
　　C) Abandonment of big government by the public.
　　D) Effective measures adopted by the government.
60. What is the author’s suggestion to the American public in face of the public government deficit?
　　A) They urge the government to revise its existing public policies.
　　B) They develop green energy to avoid dependence on oil import.
　　C) They give up the idea of smaller government and less regulation.
　　D) They put up with the inevitable sharp increase of different taxes.
61. What’s the problem with the European Union?
　　A) Conservative ideology.			B) Shrinking market.
　　C) Lack of resources.					D) Excessive borrowing.

Thirst grows for living unplugged
　　More people are taking breaks from the connected life amid the stillness and quiet of retreats like the Jesuit Center in Wernersville, Pennsylvania.
　　About a year ago, I flew to Singapore to join the writer Malcolm Gladwell, the fashion designer Marc Ecko and the graphic designer Stefan Sagmeister in addressing a group of advertising people on “Marketing to the Child of Tomorrow.” Soon after I arrived, the chief executive of the agency that had invited us took me aside. What he was most interested in, he began, was stillness and quiet.
　　A few months later, I read an interview with the well-known cutting-edge designer Philippe Starck.
　　What allowed him to remain so consistently ahead of the curve? “I never read any magazines or watch TV,” he said, perhaps with a little exaggeration. “Nor do I go to cocktail parties, dinners or anything like that.” He lived outside conventional ideas, he implied, because “I live alone mostly, in the middle of nowhere.”
　　Around the same time, I noticed that those who part with $2,285 a night to stay in a cliff-top room at the Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur, California, pay partly for the privilege of not having a TV in their rooms; the future of travel, I’m reliably told, lies in “black-hole resorts,” which charge high prices precisely because you can’t get online in their rooms.
　　Has it really come to this?
　　The more ways we have to connect, the more many of us seem desperate to unplug. Internet rescue camps in South Korea and China try to save kids addicted to the screen.
　　Writer friends of mine pay good money to get the Freedom software that enables them to disable the very Internet connections that seemed so emancipating not long ago. Even Intel experimented in 2007 with conferring four uninterrupted hours of quiet time (no phone or e-mail) every Tuesday morning on 300 engineers and managers. Workers were not allowed to use the phone or send e-mail, but simply had the chance to clear their heads and to hear themselves think.
　　The average American spends at least eight and a half hours a day in front of a screen, Nicholas Carr notes in his book The Shallows. The average American teenager sends or receives 75 text messages a day, though one girl managed to handle an average of 10,000 every 24 hours for a month.
　　Since luxury is a function of scarcity, the children of tomorrow will long for nothing more than intervals of freedom from all the blinking machines, streaming videos and scrolling headlines that leave them feeling empty and too full all at once.
　　The urgency of slowing down—to find the time and space to think—is nothing new, of course, and wiser souls have always reminded us that the more attention we pay to the moment, the less time and energy we have to place it in some larger context. “Distraction is the only thing that consoles us for our miseries,” the French philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote in the 17th century, “and yet it is itself the greatest of our miseries.” He also famously remarked that all of man’s problems come from his inability to sit quietly in a room alone.
　　When telegraphs and trains brought in the idea that convenience was more important than content, Henry David Thoreau reminded us that “the man whose horse trots (奔跑), a mile in a minute does not carry the most important messages.”
　　Marshall McLuhan, who came closer than most to seeing what was coming, warned, “When things come at you very fast, naturally you lose touch with yourself.”
　　We have more and more ways to communicate, but less and less to say. Partly because we are so busy communicating. And we are rushing to meet so many deadlines that we hardly register that what we need most are lifelines.
　　So what to do? More and more people I know seem to be turning to yoga, or meditation (沉思), or tai chi (太极)；these aren’t New Age fads (时尚的事物) so much as ways to connect with what could be called the wisdom of old age. Two friends of mine observe an “Internet sabbath (安息日)” every week, turning off their online connections from Friday night to Monday morning. Other friends take walks and “forget” their cellphones at home.
　　A series of tests in recent years has shown, Mr. Carr points out, that after spending time in quiet rural settings, subjects “exhibit greater attentiveness, stronger memory and generally improved cognition. Their brains become both calmer and sharper.” More than that, empathy (同感，共鸣)，as well as deep thought, depends (as neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio have found) on neural processes that are “inherently slow.”
　　I turn to eccentric measures to try to keep my mind sober and ensure that I have time to do nothing at all (which is the only time when I can see what I should be doing the rest of the time).I have yet to use a cellphone and I have never Tweeted or entered Facebook. I try not to go online till my day’s writing is finished, and I moved from Manhattan to rural Japan in part so I could more easily survive for long stretches entirely on foot.
　　None of this is a matter of asceticism (苦行主义)；it is just pure selfishness. Nothing makes me feel better than being in one place, absorbed in a book, a conversation, or music. It is actually something deeper than mere happiness: it is joy, which the monk (僧侣) David Steindl-Rast describes as “that kind of happiness that doesn’t depend on what happens.”
　　It is vital, of course, to stay in touch with the world. But it is only by having some distance from the world that you can see it whole, and understand what you should be doing with it.
　　For more than 20 years, therefore, I have been going several times a year—often for no longer than three days—to a Benedictine hermitage (修道院)，40 minutes down the road, as it happens, from the Post Ranch Inn. I don’t attend services when I am there, and I have never meditated, there or anywhere; I just take walks and read and lose myself in the stillness, recalling that it is only by stepping briefly away from my wife and bosses and friends that I will have anything useful to bring to them. The last time I was in the hermitage, three months ago, I happened to meet with a youngish-looking man with a 3-year-old boy around his shoulders.
　　“You’re Pico, aren’t you?” the man said, and introduced himself as Larry; we had met, I gathered, 19 years before, when he had been living in the hermitage as an assistant to one of the monks.
　　“What are you doing now?” I asked.
　　We smiled. No words were necessary.
　　“I try to bring my kids here as often as I can,” he went on. The child of tomorrow, I realized, may actually be ahead of us, in terms of sensing not what is new, but what is essential.

 Part Ⅳ             Reading Comprehension （Reading in Depth） （25 minutes）
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 54 are based on the following passage.
　　　A key process in interpersonal interaction is that of social comparison, in that we evaluate ourselves in terms of how we compare to others. In particular, we engage in two types of comparison. First, we decide whether we are superior or inferior to others on certain dimensions, such as attractiveness, intelligence, popularity, etc. Here, the important aspect is to compare with an appropriate reference group. For example, modest joggers should not compare their performance with Olympic standard marathon (马拉松) runners. Second, we judge the extent to which we are the same as or different from others. At certain stages of life, especially adolescence, the pressure to be seen as similar to peers is immense. Thus, wearing the right brand of clothes or shoes may be of the utmost importance. We also need to know whether our thoughts, beliefs and ideas are in line with those of other people. This is part of the process of self-validation whereby we employ self-disclosures to seek support for our self-concept.
　　People who do not have access to a good listener may not only be denied the opportunity to heighten their self-awareness, but they are also denied valuable feedback as to the validity and acceptability of their inner thoughts and feelings. By discussing these with others, we receive feedback as to whether these are experiences which others have as well, or whether they are less common. Furthermore, by gauging the reactions to our self-disclosures we learn what types are acceptable or unacceptable with particular people and in specific situations. On occasions it is the fear that certain disclosures may be unacceptable to family or friends that motivates an individual to seek professional help. Counsellors will be familiar with client statements such as: “I just couldn’t talk about this to my husband.”, “I really can’t let my mother know my true feelings.” Another aspect of social comparison in the counselling context relates to a technique known as normalising. This is the process whereby helpers provide reassurance to clients that what they are experiencing is not abnormal or atypical (非典型的), but is a normal reaction shared by others when facing such circumstances. Patient disclosure, facilitated by the therapist, seems also to facilitate the process of normalising.
47. To evaluate ourselves, the author thinks it important for us to compare ourselves with _______.
48. During adolescence, people generally feel an immense pressure to appear _______.
49. It is often difficult for people to heighten their self-awareness without _______.
50. What can people do if they find what they think or say unacceptable to family or friends?
51. Counsellors often assure their clients that what they experience themselves is only _______.
Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A）, B）, C） and D）. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage. 
　　Amid all the job losses, there’s one category of worker that the economic disruption has been good for: nonhumans.
　　From self-service checkout lines at the supermarket to industrial robots armed with saws and taught to carve up animal bodies in slaughter-houses, these ever-more-intelligent machines are now not just assisting workers but actually kicking them out of their jobs.
　　Automation isn’t just affecting factory workers, either. Some law firms now use artificial intelligence software to scan and read mountains of legal documents, work that previously was performed by highly-paid human lawyers.
　　“Robots continue to have an impact on blue-collar jobs, and white-collar jobs are under attack by microprocessors,” says economics professor Edward Leamer. The recession permanently wiped out 2.5 million jobs. U.S. gross domestic product has climbed back to pre-recession levels, meaning we’re producing as much as before, only with 6% fewer workers. To be sure, robotics are not the only job killers out there, with outsourcing (外包) stealing far more jobs than automation.
    Jeff Burnstein, president of the Robotics Industry Association, argues that robots actually save U.S. jobs. His logic: companies that embrace automation might use fewer workers, but that’s still better than firing everyone and moving the work overseas.
　　It’s not that robots are cheaper than humans, though often they are. It’s that they’re better. “In some cases the quality requirements are so exacting that even if you wanted to have a human do the job, you couldn’t,” Burnstein says.
　　Same goes for surgeons, who’re using robotic systems to perform an ever-growing list of operations—not because the machines save money but because, thanks to the greater precision of robots, the patients recover in less time and have fewer complications, says Dr. Myriam Curet.
    Surgeons may survive the robot invasion, but others at the hospital might not be so lucky, as iRobot, maker of the Roomba, a robot vacuum cleaner, has been showing off Ava, which could be used as a messenger in a hospital. And once you’re home, recovering, Ava could let you talk to your doctor, so there’s no need to send someone to your house. That “mobile telepresence” could be useful at the office. If you’re away on a trip, you can still attend a meeting. Just connect via videoconferencing software, so your face appears on Ava’s screen.
    Is any job safe? I was hoping to say “journalist,” but researchers are already developing software that can gather facts and write a news story. Which means that a few years from now, a robot could be writing this column. And who will read it? Well, there might be a lot of us hanging around with lots of free time on our hands.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　You’ve now heard it so many times, you can probably repeat it in your sleep. President Obama will no doubt make the point publicly when he gets to Beijing: the Chinese need to consume more; they need—believe it or not—to become more like Americans, for the sake of the global economy.
　　And it’s all true. But the other side of that equation is that the U.S. needs to save more. For the moment, American households actually are doing so. After the personal-savings rate dipped to zero in 2005, the shock of the economic crisis last year prompted people to snap shut their wallets.
　　In China, the household-savings rate exceeds 20%. It is partly for policy reasons. As we’ve seen, wage earners are expected to care for not only their children but their aging parents. And there is, to date, only the flimsiest (脆弱的) of publicly-funded health care and pension systems, which increases incentives for individuals to save while they are working. But China is a society that has long esteemed personal financial prudence (谨慎). There is no chance that will change anytime soon, even if the government creates a better social safety net and successfully encourages greater consumer spending.
　　Why does the U.S. need to learn a little frugality (节俭)？Because healthy savings rates are one of the surest indicators of a country’s long-term financial health. High savings lead, over time, to increased investment, which in turn generates productivity gains, innovation and job growth. In short, savings are the seed corn of a good economic harvest.
　　The U.S. government thus needs to act as well. By running constant deficits, it is dis-saving, even as households save more. Peter Orszag, Obama’s Budget Director, recently called the U.S. budget deficits unsustainable and he’s right. To date, the U.S. has seemed unable to see the consequences of spending so much more than is taken in. That needs to change. And though Hu Jintao and the rest of the Chinese leadership aren’t inclined to lecture visiting Presidents, he might gently hint that Beijing is getting a little nervous about the value of the dollar—which has fallen 15% since March, in large part because of increasing fears that America’s debt load is becoming unmanageable.
　　That’s what happens when you’re the world’s biggest creditor: you get to drop hints like that, which would be enough by themselves to create international economic chaos if they were ever leaked. (Every time any official in Beijing deliberates publicly about seeking an alternative to the U.S. dollar for the $2.1 trillion China holds in reserve, currency traders have a heart attack.) If Americans saved more and spent less, consistently over time, they wouldn’t have to worry about all that.  
57. How did the economic crisis affect Americans?
	A) They had to tighten their belts.
	B) Their bank savings rate dropped to zero.
	C) Their leadership in the global economy was shaken.
	D) They became concerned about China’s financial policy. 
58. What should be done to encourage Chinese people to consume?
	A) Changing their traditional way of life.
	B) Providing fewer incentives for saving.
	C) Improving China’s social security system.
	D) Cutting down the expenses on child-rearing.
59. What does the author mean by saying “savings are the seed corn of a good economic harvest” (Line 4, Para. 4)?
	A) The more one saves, the more returns one will reap.
	B) A country’s economy hinges on its savings policy.
	C) Those who keep saving will live an easy life in the end.
	D) A healthy savings rate promotes economic prosperity.
60. In what circumstances do currency traders become scared?
	A) When Beijing allows its currency exchange rates to float.
	B) When China starts to reduce its current foreign reserves.
	C) When China talks about switching its dollar reserves to other currencies.
	D) When Beijing mentions in public the huge debts America owes China.
61. What is the author’s purpose of writing the passage?
	A) To urge the American government to cut deficits.
	B) To encourage Chinese people to spend more.
	C) To tell Americans not to worry about their economy.
	D) To promote understanding between China and America.

Rates are low, but consumers won’t borrow
　　　The US Federal Reserve(Fed)'s announcement last week that it intended to keep credit cheap for at least two more years was a clear invitation to Americans: Go out and borrow. 
　　　But many economists say it will take more than low interest rates to persuade consumers to take on more debt. There are already signs that the recent stock market fluctuations, turbulence in Europe and the US deficit have scared consumers. On Friday, preliminary data showed that the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index had fallen this month to lower than it was in November 2008, when the United States was deep in recession. 
　　　Under normal circumstances, the Fed's announcement might have attracted new home and car buyers and prompted credit card holders to rack up fresh charges. But with unemployment high and those with jobs worried about keeping them, consumers are more concerned about paying off the loans they already have than adding more debt. And by showing its hand for the next two years, the Fed may have thoughtlessly invited prospective borrowers to put off large purchases. 
　　　Lenders, meanwhile, are still dealing with the effects of the boom-gone-bust and are forcing prospective borrowers to go to extraordinary lengths to prove their creditworthiness. 
　　　"I don't think lenders are going to be interested in extending a lot of debt in this environment," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, a macroeconomic consulting firm. "Nor do I think households are going to be interested in taking on a lot of debt." 
　　　In housing, consumers have already shown a slow response to low rates. Applications for new mortgages have decreased this year to a 10-year low, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Sales of furniture and furnishings remain 22% below their pre-recession peak, according to Spending Pulse, a research report by MasterCard Advisors. 
　　　Credit card rates have actually gone up slightly in the past year. The one bright spot in lending is the number of auto loans, which is up from last year. But some economists say that confidence among car buyers is hitting new lows. 
　　　For Xavier Walter, a former mortgage banker who with his wife, Danielle, accumulated$20 000 in credit card debt, low rates will not change his spending habits. 
　　　As the housing market topped out five years ago, he lost his six-figure income. He and his wife were able to modify the mortgage on their four-bedroom house in Medford, New Jersey, as well as negotiate lower credit card payments. 
　　　Two years ago, Mr. Walter, a 34-year-old father of three, started an energy business. He has sworn off credit. "I'm not going to go back in debt ever again," he said. "If I can't pay for it in cash, I don't want it." 
　　　Until now, one of the biggest restraints on consumer spending has been a debt aftereffect. Since August 2008, when household debt peaked at$12.41 trillion, it has declined by about$1.2 trillion, according to an analysis by Moody's Analytics of data from the Federal Reserve and Equifax, the credit agency. A large portion of that, though, was simply written off by lenders as borrowers defaulted on loans. 
　　　By other measures, households have improved their position. The proportion of after-tax income that households spend to remain current on loan payments has fallen. 
　　　Still, household debt remains high. That presents a paradox: many economists argue that the economy cannot achieve true health until debt levels decline. But credit, made attractive by low rates, is a time-tested way to increase consumer spending. 
　　　With new risks of another downturn, economists worry that it will take years for debt to return to manageable levels. If the economy contracts again, said George Magnus, senior adviser at UBS, then "you could find a lot of households in a debt trap which they probably can never get out of." 
　　　Mortgage lenders, meanwhile, burned by the housing crash, are extra careful about approving new loans. In June, for instance, Fannie Mae, the largest mortgage buyer in the United States, said that borrowers whose existing debt exceeded 45 to 50% of their income would be required to have stronger "compensating" factors, which might include higher savings. 
　　　Even those borrowers in strong financial positions are asked to provide unusual amounts of paperwork. Bobby and Katie Smith have an extremely good credit record, tiny student debt and a combined six-figure income. For part of their down payment, they planned to use about$5 000 they had received as wedding gifts in February. 
　　　But the lender would not accept that money unless the Smiths provided a certified letter from each of 14 guests, stating that the money was a gift, rather than a loan. 
　　　"We laughed for a good 15 or 20 minutes." recalled Mr. Smith. 34. 
　　　Mr. Smith, a program director for a radio station in Orlando, Florida, said they ended up using other savings for their down payment to buy a$300 000 four-bedroom house in April. 
　　　For those not as creditworthy as the Smiths, low rates are irrelevant because they no longer qualify for mortgages. That leaves the eligible pool of loan applicants wealthier, "older and whiter," said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. "It's creating much more of a divide," he said, "between the haves and the have-nots." 
　　　Car shoppers with the highest credit ratings can also get loans more easily, and at lower rates, said Paul C. Taylor, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association 
　　　During the recession, inability to obtain credit severely cut auto buying as lenders rejected even those with good credit ratings. Now automakers are increasing their subprime（次级债的）lending again as well, but remain hesitant to approve large numbers of risky customers. 
　　　The number of new auto loans was up by l6% in the second quarter compared with the previous year, said Melinda Zabritski, director of automotive credit at Experian, the information services company. 
　　　But some economists warn that consumer confidence is falling. According to CNW Marketing Research, confidence among those who intend to buy a car this year is at its lowest since it began collecting data on this measure in 2000. 
　　　On credit cards, rates have actually inched higher this year. largely because of new rules that curb the issuer's ability to charge fees or raise certain interest rates at will. 
　　　At the end of the second quarter, rates averaged 14. 01% on new card offers, up from 13. 75% a year earlier, according to Mail Monitor, which tracks credit cards for Synovate, a market research firm. According to data from the Federal Reserve, total outstanding debt on revolving credit cards was down by 4. 6% during the first half of the year compared with the same period a year earlier. 
　　　Even if the Fed's announcement helps keep rates steady. or pushes them down, businesses do not expect customers to suddenly charge up a storm. 
　　　"It's not like, 'Oh, credit is so cheap. let's go back to the heydays（鼎盛时期）,",said Elizabeth Crowell, who owns Sterling Place, two high-end home furnishing and gift stores in New York. "People still fear for their jobs. So I think where maybe after other recessions they might return to previous spending habits, the pendulum hasn't swung back the same way."

 Part Ⅳ             Reading Comprehension （Reading in Depth） （25 minutes）
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
Questions 47 to 54 are based on the following passage.
　　For many families, figuring out how many after-school activities are too many is a struggle. For parents who fear they're "over-scheduling" their children, a new study carries a comforting message. The paper, published last week by the Society for Research in Child Development, is the first to take a data-driven look at the issue-and whether being so busy is really a bad thing. The study suggests the phenomenon is more isolated than media reports suggest: in fact. 40,七 of children(ages 5-18) are engaged in no activities, typical kids spend just five hours a week in structured activities, and very few children-3-6%-spend 20 hours a week. On average, most kids spend far more time watching TV and playing games. And for kids who're extremely busy, there's also good news: the more activities they do, the better kids perform on measures of educational achievement and psychological adjustment. "This popular concern [about over-scheduling] has been generated by a couple of parenting books and the media," says Yale professor and lead author Joseph Mahoney. But looking at the data, "it's hard to argue that kids are over-scheduled." 
　　That news will be welcome in households like the Oviedos', in Highland Park, Ill. Nine-year-old Bianca spends six hours a week in rhythmic-gymnastics classes and three hours a week at ballet, plus a half-hour piano lesson. "The alternative would be playing on the computer or watching TV," says her mother, Anca, who believes Bianca benefits by learning to focus, making new friends and acquiring new skills. 
　　The new paper doesn't sway some experts who've advocated against activity-creep. They say kids arc far busier-and overstressed by it all-than the numbers suggest. "This is an example of researchers using big data sets to dispute the lived experience of many, many parents and families," says William Doherty, a University of Minnesota family- studies professor. Some skeptics question whether the self-reported time-diary data are really accurate; others say they don't account for all the time spent getting between activities. Alvin Rosenfeld. co-author of The Over-Scheduled Child, says: "If people follow this advice and do more activities, I think it'll be pretty damaging." Despite the doubters, the new data are a small step toward a better understanding of what's best for kids. And no matter what the numbers show, there's no disputing that every child is different--and some will absolutely do better with less. Lisa DuIg of South Lyon, Mich., feels as though her 6-year-old twins are the only kids in town who don't take skiing and ice-skating lessons. "There is nothing wrong with cuddling up（依偎）on the couch with Mom and Dad," says Lisa. And for families who prefer to bond on the sidelines of soccer fields, the latest research can provide a different kind of comfort. 
　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。

　　50. There are skeptics who raise doubts about the new study. saying that its data may be____. 
　　51 .In spite of the controversy, the new study may help people see more clearly____. 
 Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A）, B）, C） and D）. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　Who's poor in America? That's a question hard to answer. Hard because there's no conclusive definition of poverty. Low income matters, though how low is unclear. Poverty is also a state of mind that fosters self-defeating behavior-bad work habits, family breakdowns, and addictions. Finally, poverty results from bad luck: accidents, job losses, disability. 
　　Despite poverty's messiness, we've measured progress against it by a single statistic: the federal poverty line. By this measure, we haven't made much progress. But the apparent lack of progress is misleading for two reasons. 
　　First, it ignores immigration. Many immigrants are poor and low-skilled. They add to the poor. From 1989 to 2007, about three quarters of the increase in the poverty population occurred among Hispanics（西班牙裔美国人）-mostly immigrants and their children. 
　　Second, the poor's material well-being has improved. The official poverty measure obscures this by counting only pre-tax cash income and ignoring other sources of support, including food stamps and housing subsidies. Although many poor live from hand to mouth, they've participated in rising living standards. In 2005, 91% had microwaves. 79% air-conditioning, and 48% cell phones. 
　　The existing poverty line could be improved by adding some income sources and subtracting some expenses. Unfortunately, the administration's proposal for a "supplemental poverty measure" in 2011 goes beyond that. The new poverty number would compound public confusion. It also raises questions about whether the statistic is tailored to favor a political agenda. The "supplemental measure" ties the poverty threshold to what the poorest third of Americans spend on food, housing, clothing, and utilities. The actual threshold will probably be higher than today's poverty line. Many Americans would find this weird: people get richer, but "poverty" stays stuck.. 
　　What produces this outcome is a different view of poverty. The present concept is an absolute one: the poverty threshold reflects the amount estimated to meet basic needs. By contrast, the new measure embraces a relative notion of poverty: people are automatically poor if they're a given distance from the top, even if their incomes are increasing. 
　　The new indicator is a "propaganda device" to promote income redistribution by showing that poverty is stubborn or increasing. The Census Bureau has estimated statistics similar to the administration's proposal. In 2008, the traditional poverty rate was 13.2%; estimates of the new statistic range up to l7%. The new poverty statistic exceeds the old, and the gap grows larger over time. 
　　As senator Daniel Moynihan said, the administration is defining poverty up. It's legitimate to debate how much we should aid the poor or reduce economic inequality. But the debate should not be swayed by misleading statistics that few Americans could possibly understand. Government statistics should strive for political neutrality（中立）.This one fails.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　Eleven summers ago I was sent to a management program at the Wharton School to be prepared for bigger things. Along with lectures on finance and entrepreneurship and the like, the program included a delightfully out-of-place session with Al Filreis, an English professor at the University of Pennsylvania, on poetry. 
　　For three hours he talked us through "The Red Wheelbarrow" and "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." The experience----especially when contrasted with the horrible prose of our other assigned reading--sent me fleeing to the campus bookstore, where I resumed a long-interrupted romance with meter and rhyme（韵）. 
　　Professor Filreis says that he is "a little shocked" at how intensely his Wharton students respond to this unexpected deviation from the businesslike, not just as a relief but as a kind of stimulus. Many write afterward asking him to recommend books of poetry. Especially now, 
　　"The grim economy seems to make the participants keener than ever to think 'out of the box' in the way poetry encourages," he told me. 
　　Which brings me to Congress, an institution stuck deeper inside the box than just about any other these days. You have probably heard that up on Capitol Hill（美国国会山）,they're very big on prayer breakfasts, where members gather over scrambled eggs and ask God for wisdom. You can judge from the agonizing debt spectacle we've watched this summer how well that's working. Well, maybe it's time to add some poetry readings to the agenda. 
　　I'm not suggesting that poetry will guide our legislators to wisdom any more than prayer has. Just that it might make them a little more human. Poetry is no substitute for courage or competence, but properly applied, it is a challenge to self-certainty, which we currently have in excess. Poetry serves as a spur to creative thinking, a reproach to dogma and habit, a remedy to the current fashion for pledge signing. 
　　The poet Shelley, in defense of poetry nearly two centuries ago, wrote, "A man. to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own."Shelley concludes that essay by calling poets "the unacknowledged legislators of the world, "because they bring imagination to the realm of "reasoners and mechanists." 
　　The relevance of poetry was declared more concisely in five lines from the love poem "Asphodel. That Greeny Flower," by William Carlos Williams: 
　　It is difficult to get the news form poems yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there

　　C) He had just been promoted to top management. 
　　D) He was interested in finance and entrepreneurship. 
58. What did the author think of Professor Filreis's poetry session?

　　D )It pulled students out of prose reading sessions. 
59. What was the impact of the poetry session on the program participants according to Professor Filreis?

　　D) It encouraged them to embark on a political career.

In a Digital Age, Students Still Cling to Paper Textbooks
　　　They text their friends all day long. At night, they do research for their term papers on laptops and commune with their parents on Skype. But as they walk the paths of Hamilton College, a poster-perfect liberal arts school in this upstate village, students are still hauling around bulky, old-fashioned textbooks-and loving it. 
　　　"The screen won't go blank," said Faton Begolli, a junior from Boston. "There can't be a virus. It wouldn't be the same without books. They've defined 'academia' (学术) for a thousand years." 
　　　Though the world of print is receding before a tide of digital books, blogs and other Web sites, a generation of college students growing up with technology appears to be holding fast to traditional textbooks. That loyalty comes at a price. Textbooks are expensive-a year's worth can cost$700 to$900-and students' frustrations with the expense, as well as the emergence of new technology, have produced a perplexing array of options for obtaining them. 
　　　Internet retailers like Amazon and Textbooks.com are selling new and used books. They have been joined by several Web services that rent textbooks to students by the semester. Some 1 500 college bookstores are also offering rentals this fall, up from 300 last year. Here at Hamilton, students this year have a new way to avoid the middleman: a nonprofit Web site, created by the college's Entrepreneur Club, that lets them sell used books directly to one another. 
　　　The explosion of outlets and formats-including digital books, which are rapidly becoming more sophisticated- has left some students bewildered. After completing the difficult job of course selection, they are forced to weigh cost versus convenience, analyze their own study habits and guess which texts they will want for years to come and which they will not miss. 
　　　"It depends on the course," said Victoria Adesoba, a student at New York University who was standing outside that school's bookstore, a powder-blue book bag slung over her shoulder “Last semester, I rented for psychology, and it was cheaper. But for something like organic chemistry, I need to keep the book. E-textbooks are good, but it's tempting to go on Facebook, and it can strain your eyes." 
　　　For all the talk that her generation is the most technologically knowledgeable in history, paper-and-ink textbooks do not seem destined to disappear anytime soon 
　　　According to the National Association of College Stores, digital books make up just under 3% of textbook sales, although the association expects that share to grow to 10-15% by 2012 as more titles are made available as e-books. 
　　　In two recent studies-one by the association and another by the Student Public Interest Research Groups-three- quarters of the students surveyed said they still preferred a bound book to a digital version. 
　　　Many students are reluctant to give up the ability to flip quickly between chapters, write in the margins and highlight passages, although new software applications are beginning to allow students to use e-textbooks that way. 
　　　"Students grew up learning from print books." said Nicole Allen. the textbooks campaign director for the research groups, "so as they transition to higher education, it's not surprising that they prefer a format that they are most accustomed to." 
　　　Indeed, many Hamilton students grow passionate about the weighty volumes they still carry from dorm room to lecture hall to library, even as they compulsively(克制不住地)check their smartphones for text messages and c-mails. 
　　　"I believe that the codex is one of mankind's best inventions," said Jonathan Piskor, a junior from North Carolina, using the Latin term for book. 
　　　That passion may be one reason that Barnes & Noble College Booksellers is working so hard to market its new software application, NOOKstudy, which allows students to navigate c-textbooks on Macs and PCs. The company, which operates 636 campus bookstores nationwide, introduced the free application last summer in hopes of luring more students to buy its electronic textbooks. 
　　　"The real obstacle is getting them to try it," said Tracey Weber, the company's executive vicepresident. 
　　　The company is giving away "College Kick-Start Kits" to students who download NOOKstudy in the fall semester, with a dozen classic c-books like The Canterbury Tales and The Scarlet Letter. CourseSrnart is letting students try any c-textbook free for two weeks. 
　　　But not every textbook is available in digital or rental format. At Hamilton, for instance, only about one-fifth of the titles are sold as c-textbooks this fall. A stroll through the campus store revealed the price difference. A book on constitutional law,for instance, was$189.85 new $142.40 used and$85.45 for rent. (Typically, an e-textbook is cheaper than a used book, though more expensive than a rental.) 
　　　The expense of college textbooks, which is estimated to have risen four times the inflation rate in recent years, has become such a concern that some politicians are taking up the cause. Last month, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York urged more college stores to rent books, after a survey of 38 campus bookstores in New York City and on Long Island by his office found that 16 did not offer the option. 
　　　On Thursday, students at more than 40 colleges nationwide are planning an Affordable Textbooks Day of Action to encourage faculty members to assign texts that are less expensive, or offered free online. 
　　　For now, buying books the old-fashioned way-new or used-prevails. Charles Schmidt, the spokesman for the National Association of College Stores, said that if a campus store sold a new book for$100, it would typically buy the book back for$50 at semester's end and sell it to the next student for$75. 
　　　The buy-back price plunges, however, if the professor drops the book from the syllabus or if the bookstore has bought enough books to meet demand. When Louis Boguchwal, majoring in economics and math, tried to sell a$100 linear algebra(线性代数)textbook back to the college bookstore, he was offered$15. 
　　　"It was insulting," he said. "They give you next to nothing." 
　　　Thus, the creation of Hamilton's new nonprofit Web site, get my textbooks. org. So far, traffic has been light: only about 70 books have been sold this fall. But Jason Mariasis, president of the Entrepreneur Club, said he expected sales to pick up as word spread. 
　　　Mr. Begolli. a member of the club, recently sold three German novels for$17 on the site. "If I had sold them back to the bookstore, I would have gotten$7 or$8,"he said. "The bookstore is king when it comes to textbook sales. We felt there should be something for students, by students." 
　　　Yet some students have to go it alone. Rosemary Rocha, an N.Y.U. student pursuing a degree in hospitality and tourism management, added up her required reading for the semester: $600. "It's harsh," she said. "I'm currently collecting unemployment, so that's not going to happen." 
　　　Instead, she waits to borrow the few copies her professors leave on reserve at the library, or relies on the kindness of classmates. "My friends will let me borrow their books in exchange for coffee or a slice of pizza," she said. "I very seldom buy the textbooks, but I'm always like a chicken without a head."

 Part Ⅳ             Reading Comprehension （Reading in Depth） （25 minutes）
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a short passage with 5 questions or incomplete statements. Read the passage carefully. Then answer the questions or complete the statements in the fewest possible words. Please write your answers on Answer Sheet 2.
 
Questions 47 to 51 are based on the following passage. 
　　　America continues to get fatter, according to a new report on the nation's weight crisis. Statistics for 2008-2010 show that 16 states are experiencing steep increases in adult obesity, and none has seen a notable downturn in the last four years. 
　　　Even Coloradans, long the nation's slimmest citizens, are gaining excess pounds. With an obese population of 19.8%, it is the only state with an adult obesity rate below 20%.But in just the last four years, the ranks of the obese even in Colorado have grown 0.7%. 
　　　Getting out of the problem will not be simple, said Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the Trust for America's Health. The report emphasized the need for a range of measures, including boosting physical activity in schools, encouraging adults to get out and exercise, broadening access to affordable healthy foods and using "pricing strategies" to encourage Americans to make better food choices. 
　　　"Until the government takes on the food industry, we'll continue to see the appalling numbers in this report," said Kelly Brownell, director of Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. "Government could start by changing agricultural subsidies, by not making it financially attractive for companies to market unhealthy foods, by placing serious restrictions on marketing to children, and with financial policies that make healthy foods cost less and unhealthy foods cost more." 
　　　About 30 years after the United States started seeing a steep rise in the weight of children and adults, the illnesses most closely linked to obesity have begun a dramatic upturn. Diabete(糖尿病)rates in 12 states have jumped significantly, now affecting as many as 12.2% of adults in Alabama--the state with the highest obesity rates. 
　　　Obesity remains a condition disproportionately affecting those with poor education and low income, and closely tied to minority status. Among African American adults, obesity topped 40/a in 15 states. Among Latinos, it topped 30% in 23 states. 
　　　In contrast, among white adults, obesity rates were higher than 3O% in only four states, and in no state topped 32. 1%. Nearly a third of high school dropouts are obese, compared with 21.5% of those who graduated from college or technical school. 
　　　For children, the picture from the report is slightly better, said Dr. Francine Kaufman, an obesity specialist at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. "Children are for the most part holding steady." she said. 
　　　Kaufman added that the report's clear message-that obesity takes its greatest toll in low-income and minority communities-underscores that "assistance programs are definitely required" to help those populations.

47. Compared with people in other states. Coloradans have long been considered relatively____. 
48. The new report advises encouraging Americans to buy healthy foods by adopting____. 
49. To curb the increasing obesity rate, the government should first of all adjust its____. 
50. What has happened in the US shows that there is ____ between diabetes and obesity. 
51. Who are most affected by obesity in the United States according to Francine Kaufman? 
Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A）, B）, C） and D）. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 52 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　　Is 20th-century capitalism failing 21st-century society? Members of the global elite debated that unusual question at the annual World Economic Forum 
　　　It is encouraging that more than three years since the global financial crisis, a belated (迟到的) process of soul- searching has begun in search of the right lessons to learn from it. 
　　　There is a great difference, however, between being willing to talk about an issue and being ready to act. 
　　　It is a difference between those who still believe that all governments can do is get out of the way and those who believe there is a real role for governments in first reviving our economies, and then setting the right rules for future success. 
　　　If we learned anything from the 1930s, it was that governments cannot shrug their shoulders and watch as their own people are being laid off. 
　　　Nor should we forget the causes of the current growth and debt crisis as we seek to put our economies on a more sustainable footing 
　　　Both the United States and Britain suffered because their economies were overly reliant on the financial sector's artificial profits; living standards for the many worsened while the economic rewards went to the top 1 percent; a capitalist model encouraged short-term decision-making oriented toward quarterly profits rather than long-term health; and interest groups like giant banks were deemed too big to fail or too powerful to challenge. We need to recognize that the trickle-down promise (benefits given to the rich will eventually be passed on to the poor)of conservative theorists has turned into a gravity-defying reality in which wealth has flowed upward disproportionately and. too often, undeservedly. To address the problem requires fresh thinking from governments about how people train for their working lives and what a living wage should be Governments can set better-not necessarily more-rules to encourage productive businesses that make and sell real products and services. We need rules that discourage the predatory (掠夺的) behavior of those seeking the fast buck through hostile takeovers and asset-stripping that do not have the interests of the shareholders, the employees or the economy at heart. And governments must remember they are elected to serve the people, not the powerful lobbies who can pay for access or influence. Too often the real enemies of market capitalism are some of the leading beneficiaries of the current model, which favors big monopolies and consumer exploitation. I believe that changing the rules of capitalism will require a change in what citizens expect and ask of politics. The question is not so much whether 20th-century capitalism is failing 21st-century society but whether politics can rise to the challenge of changing a flawed economic model.

Passage Two
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　　Women are half the population but only 15% of board members at big American firms, and l0% in Europe. Companies that fish in only half the talent pool will lose out to those that cast their net more widely. There is also evidence that mixed boards make better decisions. 
　　　Mindful of this, European countries are passing laws that would force companies to promote more women to the executive suite. A new French law requires listed firms to reserve 40% of board seats for women by 2017. Norway and Spain have similar laws; Germany is considering one. The European Parliament declared this month that such quotas should be applied throughout the European Union. 
　　　There are two main arguments for compulsory quotas. One is that the men who dominate corporate boards are hopelessly sexist: they promote people like themselves and ignore any female talent. 
　　　The second argument is more subtle. Talented executives need mentors (导师) to help them climb the ladder. Male directors mentor young men but are reluctant to get friendly with young women, lest the relationship be misinterpreted. Quotas will break this vicious cycle by putting lots of women at the top, who can then offer their sisters a leg up. 
　　　There may be something in both arguments, but in most rich countries sexism is no longer the main obstacle to women's careers. Children are. Most women take career breaks to look after them. Many care for elderly relatives, too. One study found that two-thirds of American women had at some point switched from full-time work to part-time or flexible time to balance work and family. Such choices make it harder for women to gain the experience necessary to make it to the very top. 
　　　What is more, big companies are increasingly global. Many want a boss who has worked in more than one country. Such foreign postings disrupt families; many women turn them down. And many, anticipating a career break at some point in the future, enter fields where their skills will not quickly become outdated, such as law or human resources. Some lawyers make good chief executives. But firms often want people with financial or operational experience for the top jobs, and these fields are still male-dominated. 
　　　Quotas are too blunt a tool for such a tangled problem. The women companies are compelled to put on boards are unlikely to be as useful as those they place there voluntarily. Quotas force firms either to pad their boards with token non-executive directors, or to allocate real power on the basis of sex rather than merit. Enforcing quotas for women has led to large numbers of inexperienced women being appointed to boards, and seriously damaged those firms' performance.

	B) Its competitiveness will be weakened. 	D) It is bound to make unwise decisions. 
58. What seems to prevent women from becoming board members apart from sexism?

	B) Male directors are afraid of women's potential threat to their authority. 
	C) Few of them have the training and qualifications needed for executive duties. 
	D) Male directors refrain from giving them guidance to avoid misunderstanding. 
59. What does the author say is the real barrier to women's careers? 
	A) An apparent lack of necessary legislation. 	C) The burden of taking care of their family. 
	B) Fierce competition from male colleagues. 	D) The widespread sexism in the workplace. 
60. Why do many women choose to enter such fields as law or human resources? 
	A) They allow women career breaks if need be. 
	B) They can bring a woman's talent into full play.

Section C
Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.
          Self-image is the picture you have of yourself, the sort of person you believe you are   26  in our self-image are the categories in which you place yourself, the roles you play, and other   27   scriptors you use to identify yourself. If you tell an   28   you are a grandfather who recently lost his wife and who does   29   work on weekends, several elements of your self-image are brought to light —the roles of grandparent, widower, and   30   citizen.
　　　But self-image is more than how you picture yourself; it also involves how others see you. Three types of feedback from others    31    how they see us: confirmation, rejection, and disconfirmation. Confirmation occurs when others treat you in a manner consistent with who you believe you are. You believe you have leadership abilities and your boss put you in charge of a new work team. On the other hand, rejection occurs when others treat you in a manner that    32   your self-definition. Pierre Salinger was appointed senator from California but    33  lost his first election. He thought he was a good public official, but the voters obviously thought otherwise —their vote was inconsistent with his   34  . The third type of feedback is disconfirmation, which occurs when others fail to respond to your notion of self by responding neutrally. A student writes what he thinks is an excellent composition, but the teacher writes no encouraging remarks. Rather than   35   how others classify you, consider how you identify yourself. The way in which you identify yourself is the best reflection of your self-image.
Part Ⅲ                                        Reading Comprehension
Section A
Directions： In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word far each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　Proper street behaviour in the United States requires a nice balance of attention and inattention. You are supposed to look at a passerby just enough to show that you are aware of his   36   If you look too little, you appear haughty(目中无人的), too much and you are inquisitive（过分好奇地）.Usually what happens is that people eye each other until they are about eight feet apart, at which point both cast down their eyes. Sociologist Erving Goffman describes this as “a kind of    37   of lights”.
　　　Much of eye behaviour is so    38    that we react to it only on the intuitive level. The next time you have a conversation with someone who makes you feel liked, notice what he does with his eyes. Chances are he looks at you more often than is usual with    39    a little longer than the normal. You    40   this as a sign — a polite one —  that he is interested in you as a person rather than just in the topic of conversation. Probably you also feel that he is both self-confident and sincere. 
　　　All this has been demonstrated in    41   experiments. Subjects sit and talk in the psychologist’s laboratory,   42   of the fact that their eye behaviour is being observed from a one way vision screen. In one fairly typical experiment, subjects were  43  to cheat while performing a task, then were interviewed and observed. It was found that those who had cheated met the interviewer’s eyes less often than was    44    , an indication that “shifty eyes” —  to use the mystery writers’ stock phrase — can    45    be a tip-off(表明）to an attempt to deceive or to feelings of guilt.
A) innocent               I) actually
B) interpret               J) subtle
C) sights                   K) induced
D) dimming              L) hiding
E) normal                 M) presence
F) deceived               N) doubtfully
G) glances                 O) elaborate
H) obscure

Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
A Nation That’s Losing Its Toolbox
[A] The scene inside the Home Depot on Weyman Avenue here would give the old-time American craftsman pause. In Aisle 34 is precut plastic flooring, the glue already in place. In Aisle 26 are prefabricated windows. Stacked near the checkout counters, and as colourful as a Fisher-Price toy, is a not-so-serious-looking power tool: a battery-operated saw-and-drill combination. And if you don’t want to do it yourself, head to Aisle 23 or Aisle 35, where a help desk will arrange for an installer.
[B] It’s all very handy stuff, I guess, a convenient way to be a do-it-yourselfer without being all that good with tools. But at a time when the American factory seems to be a shrinking presence, and when good manufacturing jobs have vanished, perhaps never to return, there is something deeply troubling about this dilution of American craftsmanship.
[C] This isn’t a lament(伤感) — or not merely a lament — for bygone times. It’s a social and cultural issue, as well as an economic one. The Home Depot approach to craftsmanship — simplify it, dumb it down, hire a contractor— is one signal that mastering tools and working with one’s hands is receding in America as a hobby, as a valued skill, as a cultural influence that shaped thinking and behaviour in vast sections of the country. 
[D] That should be a matter of concern in a presidential election year. Yet neither Barack Obama nor Mitt Romney promotes himself as tool-savvy(使用工具很在行的）presidential timber, in the mold of a Jimmy Carter, a skilled carpenter and cabinet maker. The Obama administration does worry publicly about manufacturing, a first cousin of craftsmanship. When the Ford Motor Company, for example, recently announced that it was bringing some production home, the White House cheered. “When you see things like Ford moving new production from Mexico to Detroit, instead of the other way around, you know things are changing,” says Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council.
[E] Ask the administration or the Republicans or most academics why America needs more manufacturing, and they respond that manufacturing gives birth to innovation, brings down the trade deficit, strengthens the dollar, generates jobs, arms the military and brings about a recovery from recession. But rarely, if ever, do they publicly take the argument a step further, asserting that a growing manufacturing sector encourages craftsmanship and that craftsmanship is, if not a birthright, then a vital ingredient of the American self-image as a can-do, inventive, we-can-make-anything people.
[F] Traditional vocational training in public high schools is gradually declining, stranding thousands
of young people who seek training for a craft without going to college. Colleges, for their part, have since 1985 graduated fewer chemical, mechanical, industrial and metallurgical(冶金的）engineers, partly in response to the reduced role of manufacturing, a big employer of them. The decline started in the 1950s, when manufacturing generated a sturdy 28% of the national income, or gross domestic product, and employed one-third of the workforce. Today, factory output generates just 12% of GDP and employs barely 9% of the nation’s workers.
[G] Mass layoffs and plant closings have drawn plenty of headlines and public debate over the years, and they still occasionally do. But the damage to skill and craftsmanship — what’s needed to build a complex airliner or a tractor, or for a worker to move up from assembler to machinist to supervisor — went largely unnoticed.
[H] “In an earlier generation, we lost our connection to the land, and now we are losing our connection to the machinery we depend on,” says Michael Hout, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley. “People who work with their hands,” he went on, “are doing things today that we call service jobs, in restaurants and laundries, or in medical technology and the like.”
[I] That’s one explanation for the decline in traditional craftsmanship. Lack of interest is another. The big money is in fields like finance. Starting in the 1980s, skill in finance grew in importance, and, as depicted in the news media and the movies, became a more appealing source of income. By last year, Wall Street traders, bankers and those who deal in real estate generated 21% of the national income, double their share in the 1950s. And Warren Buffett, the good-natured financier, became a homespun folk hero, without the tools and overalls (工作服).
[J] “Young people grow up without developing the skills to fix things around the house,” says Richard Curtin, director of the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. “They know about computers, of course, but they don’t know how to build them.”
[K] Manufacturing’s shrinking presence undoubtedly helps explain the decline in craftsmanship, if only because many of the nation’s assembly line workers were skilled in craft work, if not on the job then in their spare time. In a late 1990s study of blue-collar employees at a General Motors plant (now closed) in Linden, NJ, the sociologist Ruth Milkman of City University of New York found that many line workers, in their off-hours, did home renovation and other skilled work. “I have often thought,” Ms Milkman says, “that these extracurricular jobs were an effort on the part of the workers to regain their dignity after suffering the degradation of repetitive assembly line work in the factory.”
[L] Craft work has higher status in nations like Germany, which invests in apprenticeship（学徒）programmes for high school students. “Corporations in Germany realised that there was an interest to be served economically and patriotically in building up a skilled labour force at home; we never had that ethos（风气）,”says Richard Sennett, a New York University sociologist who has written about the connection of craft and culture.
[M] The damage to American craftsmanship seems to parallel the steep slide in manufacturing employment. Though the decline started in the 1970s, it became much steeper beginning in 2000. Since then, some 5.3 million jobs, or one-third of the workforce in manufacturing, have been lost. A stated goal of the Obama administration is to restore a big chunk of this employment, along with the multitude of skills that many of the jobs required.
[N] As for craftsmanship itself, the issue is how to preserve it as a valued skill in the general population. Ms Milkman, the sociologist, argues that American craftsmanship isn’t disappearing as quickly as some would argue — that it has instead shifted to immigrants. “Pride in craft, it is alive in the immigrant world,” she says.
[O] Sol Axelrod, 37, the manager of the Home Depot here, fittingly learned to fix his own car as a teenager, even changing the brakes. Now he finds immigrant craftsmen. gathered in abundance outside his store in the early morning, waiting for it to open so they can buy supplies for the day’s work as contractors. Skilled day laborers, also mostly immigrants, wait quietly in hopes of being hired by the contractors. Mr Axelrod also says the recession and persistently high unemployment have forced many people to try to save money by doing more themselves, and Home Depot in response offers classes in fixing water taps and other simple repairs. The teachers are store employees, many of them older and semi-retired from a skilled trade, or laid off. “Our customers may not be building cabinets or outdoor decks; we try to do that for them,’’ Mr Axelrod says, “but some are trying to build up skill so they can do more for themselves in these hard times.”
46.Mastering tools and working with one’s hands shapes people’s thinking and behaviour.
47.The factor that people can earn more money in fields other than manufacturing contributes to the decline in traditional craftsmanship.
48.According to the author, manufacturing encourages craftsmanship.
49.According to Ruth Milkman, American craftsmanship, instead of disappearing, is being taken up by immigrants.
50.The White House welcomed Ford’s announcement to bring some production back to America.
51.According to Mr Axelrod of Home Depot, people are trying to ride out the recession by doing more themselves.
52.America’s manufacturing in the 1950s constituted 28% of the gross domestic product.
53.In Ruth Milkman’s opinion, many assembly line workers did home renovation and other skilled work in their off-hours in order to regain their dignity.
54.The author felt troubled about the weakening of American craftsmanship.
55.Compared with that in America, the status of craft work in Germany is higher.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　　The report from the Bureau of Labour Statistics was just as gloomy as anticipated. Unemployment in January jumped to a 16-year high of 7.6 percent, as 598,000 jobs were slashed from U.S. payrolls in the worst single-month decline since December, 1974. With 1.8 million jobs lost in the last three months, there is urgent desire to boost the economy as quickly as possible. But Washington would do well to take a deep breath before reacting to the grim numbers.
　　　Collectively, we rely on the unemployment figures and other statistics to frame our sense of reality. They are a vital part of an array of data that we use to assess if we’re doing well or doing badly, and that in turn shapes government policies and corporate budgets and personal spending decisions. The problem is that the statistics aren’t an objective measure of reality; they are simply a best approximation. Directionally, they capture the trends, but the idea that we know precisely how many are unemployed is a myth. That makes finding a solution all the more difficult.
　　　First, there is the way the data is assembled. The official unemployment rate is the product of a telephone survey of about 60,000 homes. There is another survey, sometimes referred to as the “payroll survey”, that assesses 400,000 businesses based on their reported payrolls. Both surveys have problems. The payroll survey can easily double-count someone: if you are one person with two jobs, you show up as two workers. The payroll survey also doesn’t capture the number of self- employed, and so says little about how many people are generating an independent income.
　　　The household survey has a larger problem. When asked straightforwardly, people tend to lie or shade the truth when the subject is sex, money or employment. If you get a call and are asked if you’re employed, and you say yes, you’re employed. If you say no, however, it may surprise you to learn that you are only unemployed if you’ve been actively looking for work in the past four weeks; otherwise, you are “marginally attached to the labour force” and not actually unemployed.
　　　The urge to quantify is embedded in our society. But the idea that statisticians can then capture an objective reality isn’t just impossible. It also leads to serious misjudgments. Democrats and Republicans can and will take sides on a number of issues, but a more crucial concern is that both are basing major policy decisions on guesstimates rather than looking at the vast wealth of raw data with a critical eye and an open mind.
56.What do we learn from the first paragraph?
	A) The US economic situation is going from bad to worse.
	B) Washington is taking drastic measures to provide more jobs.
	C) The US government is slashing more jobs from its payrolls.
	D) The recent economic crisis has taken the US by surprise.
57.What does the author think of the unemployment figures and other statistics?
	A) They form a solid basis for policy making.	C) They signal future economic trends.
	B) They represent the current situation.	D) They do not fully reflect the reality.
58.  One problem with the payroll survey is that	           .
	A)  it does not include all the businesses	C) it magnifies the number of the jobless
	B)  it fails to count in the self-employed	D) it does not treat all companies equally
59.  The household survey can be faulty in that	.
	A) people tend to lie when talking on the phone
	B) not everybody is willing or ready to respond
	C) some people won’t provide truthful information
	D) the definition of unemployment is too broad
60.  At the end of the passage, the author suggests that	.
	A) statisticians improve their data assembling methods
	B) decision makers view the statistics with a critical eye
	C) politicians listen more before making policy decisions
	D) Democrats and Republicans cooperate on crucial issues
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　　At some point in 2008, someone, probably in either Asia or Africa, made the decision to move from the countryside to the city. This nameless person pushed the human race over a historic threshold, for it was in that year that mankind became, for the first time in its history, a predominantly urban species.
　　　It is a trend that shows no sign of slowing. Demographers(人 口统计学家）reckon that three-quarters of humanity could be city-dwelling by 2050, with most of the increase coming in the fast-growing towns of Asia and Africa. Migrants to cities are attracted by plentiful jobs, access to hospitals and education, and the ability to escape the boredom of a farmer’s agricultural life. Those factors are more than enough to make up for the squalor（肮脏 ）disease and spectacular poverty that those same migrants must often at first endure when they become urban dwellers.
　　　It is the city that inspires the latest book from Peter Smith. His main thesis is that the buzz of urban life, and the opportunities it offers for cooperation and collaboration, is what attracts people to the city, which in turn makes cities into the engines of art, commerce, science and progress. This is hardly revolutionary, but it is presented in a charming format. Mr Smith has written a breezy guidebook, with a series of short chapters dedicated to specific aspects of urbanity — parks, say, or the various schemes that have been put forward over the years for building the perfect city. The result is a sort of high-quality, unusually rigorous coffee-table book, designed to be dipped into rather than read from beginning to end.
　　　In the chapter on skyscrapers, for example, Mr Smith touches on construction methods, the revolutionary invention of the automatic lift, the practicalities of living in the sky and the likelihood that, as cities become more crowded, apartment living will become the norm. But there is also time for brief diversions onto bizarre ground, such as a discussion of the skyscraper index (which holds that a boom in skyscraper construction is a foolproof sign of an imminent recession).
　　　One obvious criticism is that the price of breadth is depth: many of Mr Smith’s essays raise as many questions as they answer. Although that can indeed be frustrating, this is probably the only way to treat so grand a topic. The city is the building block of civilisation and of almost everything people do; a guidebook to the city is really, therefore, a guidebook to how a large and ever-growing chunk of humanity chooses to live. Mr Smiths book serves as an excellent introduction to a vast subject, and will suggest plenty of further lines of inquiry.
61.  In what way is the year 2008 historic?
	A) For the first time in history, urban people outnumbered rural people.
	B) An influential figure decided to move from the countryside to the city.
	C) It is in this year that urbanisation made a start in Asia and Africa.
	D) The population increase in cities reached a new peak in Asia and Africa.
62. What does the author say about urbanisation?
	A) Its impact is not easy to predict.	C) It is a milestone in human progress.
	B) Its process will not slow down.	D) It aggravates the squalor of cities.
63. How does the author comment on Peter Smith’s new book?
	A) It is but an ordinary coffee-table book.	C) It serves as a guide to art and commerce.
	B) It is flavoured with humorous stories.               D) It is written in a lively and interesting style.
64. What does the author say in the chapter on skyscrapers?
	A) The automatic lift is indispensable in skyscrapers.
	B) People enjoy living in skyscrapers with a view.
	C) Skyscrapers are a sure sign of a city’s prosperity.
	D) Recession closely follows a skyscraper boom.
65. What may be one criticism of Mr Smith’s book?
	A) It does not really touch on anything serious.
	B) It is too long for people to read from cover to cover.
	C) It does not deal with any aspect of city life in depth.
	D) It fails to provide sound advice to city dwellers.

Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　Children are losing the ability to play properly because they are being given too many toys, according to a new research. The studies show that children — especially those under five — are often    36    and actually play less than those with fewer toys.
　　　“Our studies show that giving children too many toys or toys of the   37   type can actually be doing them harm. They get spoiled and cannot   38   on any one thing long enough to learn from it”, said Lerner, a childhood development researcher. Her conclusions have been backed up by British research looking at children with   39   few toys, whose parents spend more time reading, singing or playing with them. It showed such children   40   youngsters from richer backgrounds — even those who had access to computers.
　　　Kathy Sylva, professor of educational psychology at Oxford University, reached her   41  from a study of 3,000 children from the ages of three to five. In her opinion, there is a complex relationship between children’s progress, the type of toys they are given and the time parents spend on them. When the children have a large number of toys there seems to be a distraction element, and when children are  42   they do not learn or play well.
　　　Some parents notice the   43    early. Orhan Ismail, a researcher from Colchester, Essex, saw a change for the worse in Cameron, his 10-month-old son, after he was given   44   toys last Christmas. He observed that if there are too many toys in front of Cameron, he will just keep moving round them and then end up going away and finding something like a slipper to play with.
　　　Experts   45   to put a figure on the number of toys children should have, but many believe two dozen is enough for children of pre-school age.
A) impact                  I) surpass
B) concentrate           J) innumerable
C) overwhelmed       K) decisions
D) reasonably            L) inaccurate
E) conclusions           M) relatively
F) exquisite                N) distracted

Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Norman Borlaug: “Father of the Green Revolution”
[A] Few people have quietly changed the world for the better more than this rural lad from the midwestem state of Iowa in the United States. The man in focus is Norman Borlaug, the “Father of the Green Revolution”, who died on 12 September 2009 at age 95. Norman Borlaug spent most of his 60 working years in the farmlands of Mexico, South Asia and later in Africa, fighting world hunger, and saving by some estimates up to a billion lives in the process. An achievement, fit for a Nobel Peace Prize.
　　　Early Years
[B] “I’m a product of the great depression” is how Borlaug described himself. A great-grandson of Norwegian immigrants to the United States, Borlaug was born in 1914 and grew up on a small farm in the northeastern comer of Iowa in a town called Cresco. His family had a 40-hectrare (公顷)farm on which they grew wheat, maize (玉米)and hay and raised pigs and cattle. Norman spent most of his time from age 7-17 on the farm, even as he attended a one-room, one-teacher school at New Oregon in Howard County.
[C] Borlaug didn’t have money to go to college. But through a Great Depression era programme, known as the National Youth Administration, Borlaug was able to enroll in University of Minnesota at Minneapolis to study forestry. He excelled in studies and received his PhD in plant pathology (病理学）and genetics in 1942.
[D] From 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was employed as a microbiologist at DuPont in Wilmington. However, following the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Borlaug tried to join the military, but was rejected under wartime labour regulations.
　　　In Mexico
[E] In 1944, many experts warned of mass starvation in developing nations where populations were expanding faster than crop production. Borlaug began work at a Rockefeller Foundation- funded project in Mexico to increase wheat production by developing higher-yielding varieties of the crop. It involved research in genetics, plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology（昆虫学），agronomy（农艺学）,soil science, and cereal technology. The goal of the project was to boost wheat production in Mexico, which at the time was importing a large portion of its grain.
[F] Borlaug said that his first couple of years in Mexico were difficult. He lacked trained scientists and equipment. Native farmers were hostile towards the wheat programme because of serious crop losses from 1939 to 1941 due to stem rust.
[G] Wheat varieties that Borlaug worked with had tall, thin stalks. While taller wheat competed better for sunlight, they had a tendency to collapse under the weight of extra grain — a trait called lodging. To overcome this, Borlaug worked on breeding wheat with shorter and stronger stalks, which could hold on larger seed heads. Borlaug’s new semi-dwarf, disease-resistant varieties, called Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62, changed the potential yield of Mexican wheat dramatically. By 1963 wheat production in Mexico stood six times more than that of 1944.
Green Revolution in India
[H] During the 1960s, South Asia experienced severe drought condition and India had been importing wheat on a large scale from the United States. Borlaug came to India in 1963 along with Dr Robert Anderson to duplicate his Mexican success in the sub-continent. The experiments began with planting a few of the high-yielding variety strains in the fields of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa in New Delhi, under the supervision of Dr M. S. Swaminathan. These strains were subsequently planted in test plots at Ludhiana, Pantnagar, Kanpur, Pune and Indore. The results were promising, but large-scale success, however, was not instant. Cultural opposition to new agricultural techniques initially prevented Borlaug from going ahead with planting of new wheat strains in India. By 1965, when the drought situation turned alarming, the Government took the lead and allowed wheat revolution to move forward. By employing agricultural techniques he developed in Mexico, Borlaug was able to nearly double South Asian wheat harvests between 1965 and 1970.
[I] India subsequently made a huge commitment to Mexican wheat, importing some 18,000 tonnes of seed. By 1968, it was clear that the Indian wheat harvest was nothing short of revolutionary. It was so productive that there was a shortage of labour to harvest it, of bull carts to haul it to the threshing floor（打谷场）of jute（黄麻）bags to store it. Local governments in some areas were forced to shut down schools temporarily to use them as store houses.
[J] United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) observed that in 40 years between 1961 and 2001,“India more than doubled its population, from 452 million to more than 1 billion. At the same time, it nearly tripled its grain production from 87 million tonnes to 231 million tonnes. It accomplished this feat while increasing cultivated grain acreage （土地面积）a mere 8 percent.” It was in India that Norman Borlaug’s work was described as the “Green Revolution.”
In Africa
[K] Africa suffered widespread hunger and starvation through the 70s and 80s. Food and aid poured in from most developed countries into the continent, but thanks to the absence of efficient distribution system, the hungry remained empty-stomach. The then Chairman of the Nippon Foundation, Ryoichi Sasakawa wondered why the methods used in Mexico and India were not extended to Africa. He called up Norman Borlaug, now leading a semi-retired life, for help. He managed to convince Borlaug to help with his new effort and subsequently founded the Sasakawa Africa Association. Borlaug later recalled, “but after I saw the terrible circumstances there, I said, ‘Let’s just start growing’”.
[L] The success in Africa was not as spectacular as it was in India or Mexico. Those elements that allowed Borlaug’s projects to succeed, such as well-organised economies and transportation and irrigation systems, were severely lacking throughout Africa. Because of this, Borlaug’s initial projects were restricted to developed regions of the continent. Nevertheless, yields of maize, sorghum (高粱) and wheat doubled between 1983 and 1985.
　　　Nobel Prize
[M] For his contributions to the world food supply, Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. Norwegian officials notified his wife in Mexico City at 4:00 am, but Borlaug had already left for the test fields in the Toluca valley, about 65km west of Mexico City. A chauffeur (司机）took her to the fields to inform her husband. In his acceptance speech, Borlaug said, “the first essential component of social justice is adequate food for all mankind. Food is the moral right of all who are born into this world. Yet, 50 percent of the world population goes hungry.”
　　　Green Revolution vs Environmentalists
[N] Borlaug’s advocacy of intensive high-yield agriculture came under severe criticism from environmentalists in recent years. His work faced environmental and socio-economic criticisms, including charges that his methods have created dependence on monoculture crops, unsustainable fanning practices, heavy indebtedness among subsistence farmers, and high levels of cancer among those who work with agriculture chemicals. There are also concerns about the long-term sustainability of fanning practices encouraged by the Green Revolution in both the developed and the developing world.
[O] In India, the Green Revolution is blamed for the destruction of India crop diversity, drought vulnerability, dependence on agro-chemicals that poison soils but reap large-scale benefits mostly to the American multi-national corporations. What these critics overwhelmingly advocate is a global movement towards “organic” or “sustainable” farming practices that avoid using chemicals and high technology in favour of natural fertilisers, cultivation and pest-control porgrammes.
46.Farmers’ rejection of his planting techniques initially prevented Borlaug from achieving large- scale success in India.
47.In both developed and developing countries there are concerns whether in the long run Borlaug’s farming practice will be sustainable.
48.Borlaug’s Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62 has short and strong stems and can resist to diseases.
49.Borlaug’s success in Africa was not as spectacular as in India or Mexico because Africa lacked the necessary supporting facilities.
50.In India, critics attribute the destruction of Indian crop diversity to the Green Revolution.
51.Borlaug emphasised that adequate food for all mankind is essential in ensuring social justice in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.
52.In recent years Borlaug’s Green Revolution has been attacked by environmentalists.
53.Borlaug’s wheat programme had been stuck in trouble during his first couple of years in Mexico.
54.According to United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation, in 40 years between 1961 and 2001 India’s grain production increased nearly three times.
55.Norman Borlaug won a Nobel Prize for his 60 years work on combating world hunger.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　　“Depression” is more than a serious economic downturn. What distinguishes a depression from a harsh recession is paralysing fear — fear of the unknown so great that it causes consumers, businesses, and investors to retreat and panic. They save up cash and desperately cut spending. They sell stocks and other assets. A shattering loss of confidence inspires behaviour that overwhelms the normal self-correcting mechanisms that usually prevent a recession from becoming deep and prolonged: a depression.
　　　Comparing 1929 with 2007-09, Christina Romer, the head of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, finds the initial blow to confidence far greater now than then. True, stock prices fell a third from September to December 1929, but fewer Americans then owned stocks. Moreover, home prices barely dropped. From December 1928 to December 1929, total household wealth declined only 3%. By contrast, the loss in household wealth between December 2007 and December 2008 was 17%. Both stocks and homes, more widely held, dropped more. Thus traumatised (受到创伤），the economy might have gone into a free fall ending in depression. Indeed, it did go into free fall. Shoppers refrained from buying cars, appliances, and other big- ticket items. Spending on such “durables” dropped at a 12% annual rate in 2008’s third quarter, a 20% rate in the fourth. And businesses shelved investment projects.
　　　That these huge declines didn’t lead to depression mainly reflects, as Romer argues, counter-measures taken by the government. Private markets for goods, services, labor, and securities do mostly self-correct, but panic feeds on itself and disarms these stabilising tendencies. In this situation, only the government can protect the economy as a whole, because most individuals and companies are involved in the self-defeating behaviour of self-protection.
　　　Government’s failure to perform this role in the early 1930s transformed recession into depression. Scholars will debate which interventions this time — the Federal Reserve’s support of a failing credit system, guarantees of bank debt, Obama’s “stimulus” plan and bank “stress test” 一 counted most in preventing a recurrence. Regardless, all these complex measures had the same psychological purpose: to reassure people that the free fall would stop and, thereby, curb die fear that would perpetuate( 使持久）a free fall.
　　　All this improved confidence. But the consumer sentiment index remains weak, and all the rebound has occurred in Americans’ evaluation of future economic conditions, not the present. Unemployment (9.8%) is abysmal(糟透的）, the recovery’s strength unclear. Here, too, there is an echo from the 1930s. Despite bottoming out in 1933, the Depression didn’t end until World War II. Some government policies aided recovery; some hindered it. The good news today is that the bad news is not worse.
56.Why do consumers, businesses and investors retreat and panic in times of depression?
A) They suffer great losses in stocks, property and other assets.
B) They find the self-correcting mechanisms dysfunctioning.
C) They are afraid the normal social order will be paralysed.
D) They don’t know what is going to happen in the future.
57.What does Christina Romer say about the current economic recession?
A) Its severity is no match for the Great Depression of 1929.
B) Its initial blow to confidence far exceeded that of 1929.
C) It has affected house owners more than stock holders.
D) It has resulted in a free fall of the prices of commodities.
58.Why didn’t the current recession turn into a depression according to Christina Romer?
A) The government intervened effectively.
B) Private markets corrected themselves.
C) People refrained from buying durables and big-ticket items.
D) Individuals and companies adopted self-protection measures.
59.What is the chief purpose of all the counter measures taken?
A) To create job opportunities.	C)To stimulate domestic consumption.
B) To curb the fear of a lasting free fall.	D)To rebuild the credit system.
60.What does the author think of today’s economic situation?
A) It may worsen without further stimulation.	C)It has not gone from bad to worse.
B) It will see a rebound sooner or later.             	D)It does not give people reason for pessimism.
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　　“Usually when we walk through-the rain forest we hear a soft sound from all the moist leaves and organic debris on the forest floor,” says ecologist Daniel Nepstad. “ Now we increasingly get rustle and crunch. That’s the sound of a dying forest.”
　　　Predictions of the collapse of the tropical rain forests have been around for years. Yet until recently the worst forecasts were almost exclusively linked to direct human activity, such as dear- cutting and burning for pastures or farms. Left alone, it was assumed, the world’s rain forests would not only flourish but might even rescue us from disaster by absorbing the excess carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gases. Now it turns out that may be wishful thinking. Some scientists believe that the rise in carbon levels means that the Amazon and other rain forests in Asia and Africa may go from being assets in the battle against rising temperatures to liabilities. Amazon plants, for instance, hold more than 100 billion metric tons of carbon, equal to 15 years of tailpipe and chimney emissions. If the collapse of the rain forests speeds up dramatically, it could eventually release 3.5-5 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year 一 making forests the leading source of greenhouse gases.
　　　Uncommonly severe droughts brought on by global climate change have led to forest-eating wildfires from Australia to Indonesia, but nowhere more acutely than in the Amazon. Some experts say that the rain forest is already at the brink of collapse.
　　　Extreme weather and reckless development are plotting against the rain forest in ways that scientists have never seen. Trees need more water as temperatures rise, but the prolonged droughts have robbed them of moisture, making whole forests easily cleared of trees and turned into farmland. The picture worsens with each round of El Nino, the unusually warm currents in the Pacific Ocean that drive up temperatures and invariably presage（预示）droughts and fires in the rain forest. Runaway fires pour even more carbon into the air, which increases temperatures, starting the whole vicious cycle all over again.
　　　More than paradise lost, a perishing rain forest could trigger a domino effect—sending winds and rains kilometres off course and loading the skies with even greater levels of greenhouse gases— that will be felt far beyond the Amazon basin. In a sense, we are already getting a glimpse of what’s to come. Each burning season in the Amazon, fires deliberately set by frontier settlers and developers hurl up almost half a billion metric tons of carbon a year, placing Brazil among the top five contributors to greenhouse gases in the world.
61.We learn from the first paragraph that	.
A) dead leaves and tree debris make the same sound
B) trees that are dying usually give out a soft moan
C) organic debris echoes the sounds in a rain forest
D) the sound of a forest signifies its health condition
62.In the second paragraph, the author challenges the view that	.
A) the collapse of rain forests is caused by direct human interference
B) carbon emissions are the leading cause of current global warming
C) the condition of rain forests has been rapidly deteriorating
D) rain forests should not be converted into pastures or farms
63.The author argues that the rising carbon levels in rain forests may	.
A) turn them into a major source of greenhouse gases
B) change the weather patterns throughout the world
C) pose a threat to wildlife
D) accelerate their collapse
64.What has made it easier to turn some rain forests into farmland?
A)  Rapid rise in carbon levels.	C) Lack of rainfall resulting from global warming.
B)  Reckless land development.                       D) The unusual warm currents in the Pacific Ocean.
65.What makes Brazil one of the world’s top five contributors to greenhouse gases?
A) The domino effect triggered by the perishing rain forests.
B) Its practice of burning forests for settlement and development.
C) The changed patterns of winds and rains in the Amazon area.
D) Its inability to curb the carbon emissions from industries.

　　　The ideal companion machine would not only look, feel, and sound friendly but would also be programmed to behave in an agreeable manner. Those qualities that   26   other people enjoyable would be simulated as closely as possible, and the machine would appear to be    27  ,stimulating and easygoing. Its informal conversational style would make interaction comfortable, and yet the machine would remain slightly   28   and therefore interesting. In its first    29   , it might be somewhat hesitant and unassuming, but as it came to know the user it would progress to a more    30    and intimate style. The machine would not be a passive     31    but would add its own suggestions, information, and opinions; it would sometimes     32   in developing or changing the topic and would have a    33   of its own.
　　　The machine would convey presence. We have all seen how a computer’s use of personal names often fascinates people and needs them to treat the machine as if it were almost human. Such features are easily written into the software. By introducing a degree of forcefulness and humour, the machine could    34   a vivid and unique character.
　　　Friendships are not made in a day, and the computer would be more    35   as a friend if it simulated the gradual changes that occur when one person is getting to know another. At an appropriate time it might also express the kind of affection that stimulates attachment and intimacy.
Part Ⅲ                                        Reading Comprehension
Section A
Directions： In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word far each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　Most experts in sleep behaviour agree that there is virtually an epidemic of sleepiness in the nation. “I can’t think of a   36   study that hasn’t found Americans getting less sleep than they ought to,” says Dr David.
　　　The beginning of our sleep-deficit crisis can be    37    to the invention of the light bulb a century ago. From diary entries and other personal accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries, sleep scientists have reached the    38    that the average person used to sleep about 9.5 hours a night. By the 1950s and 1960s, that sleep schedule had been reduced    39    to between 7.5 and 8 hours, and most people had to wake to an alarm clock. “People cheat on their sleep, and they don’t realise they’re doing it,” says Dr David. “They think they’re okay because they can get by on 6.5 hours, when they really need 7.5, 8 or even more to feel   40   vigorous.”
　　　Perhaps the most merciless robber of sleep, researchers say, is the   41   of the day. Whenever pressures from work, family, friends and community mount, many people consider sleep the least expensive item on the agenda. “In our society, you’re considered   42   if you say you only need 5.5 hours’ sleep. If you say you’ve got to get 8.5 hours, people think you lack drive and ambition.” To assess the    43    of sleep deficit, researchers have put subjects through a set of psychological and performance tests requiring them, for instance, to add columns of numbers or   44   a passage read to them only minutes earlier. “We’ve found that if you’re sleep-deprived, performance suffers,” says Dr David. “Short-term memory is   45   , so are abilities to make decisions and to concentrate.”
A) ideally                        I) conclusion
B) dynamic                      J) drastic
C) currently                     K) expectations
D) single                          L) dramatically
E) startlingly                   M) recur
F) complexity                  N) consequences
H) traced                          O) impaired
I) recall

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Welcome, Freshmen. Have an iPod.
[A] Taking a step that many professors may view as a bit counterproductive, some colleges and universities are doling out Apple iPhones and Internet-capable iPods to their students. The always-on Internet devices raise some novel possibilities, like tracking where students gather together. With far less controversy, colleges could send messages about cancelled classes, delayed buses, campus crises or just the cafeteria menu.
[B] While schools emphasise its usefulness — online research in class and instant polling of students, for example 一 a big part of the attraction is, undoubtedly, that the iPhone is cool and a hit with students. Being equipped with one of the most recent cutting-edge IT products could just help a college or university foster a cutting-edge reputation.
[C] Apple stands to win as well, hooking more young consumers with decades of technology purchases ahead of them. The lone losers, some fear, could be professors. Students already have laptops and cell phones, of course, but the newest devices can take class distractions to a new level. They practically beg a user to ignore the long-suffering professor struggling to pass on accumulated wisdom from the front of the room 一 a prospect that teachers find most irritating and students view as, well, inevitable.
[D] “When it gets a little boring, I might pull it out,” acknowledged Naomi Pugh, a first-year student at Freed-Hardeman University in Henderson, Tenn., referring to her new iPod Touch, which can connect to the Internet over a campus wireless network. She speculated that professors might try even harder to make classes interesting if they were to compete with the devices.
[E] Experts see a movement toward the use of mobile technology in education, though they say it is in its infancy as professors try to come up with useful applications. Providing powerful hand-held devices is sure to fuel debates over the role of technology in higher education. “We think this is the way the future is going to work” said Kyle Dickson, co-director of research and the mobile learning initiative at Abilene Christian University in Texas, which has bought more than 600 iPhones and 300 iPods for students entering this fall.
[F] Although plenty of students take their laptops to class, they don’t take them everywhere and would prefer something lighter. Abilene Christian settled on the devices after surveying students and finding that they did not like hauling around their laptops, but that most of them always carried a cell phone, Dr Dickson said.
[G] It is not clear how many colleges and universities plan to give out iPhones and iPods this fall; officials at Apple were unwilling to talk about the subject and said that they would not leak any institution’s plans. “We can’t announce other people’s news,” said Greg Joswiak, vice president of iPod and iPhone marketing at Apple. He also said that he could not discuss discounts to universities for bulk purchases.
[H] At least four institutions — the University of Maryland, Oklahoma Christian University, Abilene Christian and Freed-Hardeman 一 have announced that they will give the devices to some or all of their students this fall. Other universities are exploring their options. Stanford University has hired a student-run company to design applications like a campus map and directory for the iPhone. It is considering whether to issue iPhones but not sure it’s necessary, noting that more than 700 iPhones were registered on the university’s network last year. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, iPhones might already have been everywhere, if AT&T, the wireless carrier offering the iPhone in the United States, had a more reliable network, said Andrew Yu, mobile devices platform project manager at MIT. “We would have probably gone ahead with this, maybe just getting a thousand iPhones and giving them out,” Mr. Yu said.
[I] The University of Maryland at College Park is proceeding cautiously, giving the iPhone or iPod Touch to 150 students, said Jeffrey Huskamp, vice president and chief information officer at the university. “We don’t think that we have all the answers,” Mr. Huskamp said. By observing how students use the gadgets, he said, “We’re trying to get answers from the students.”
[J] At each college, the students who choose to get an iPhone must pay for mobile phone service. Those service contracts include unlimited data use. Both the iPhones and the iPod Touch devices can connect to the Internet through campus wireless networks. With the iPhone, those networks may provide faster connections and longer battery life than AT&T’s data network. Many cell phones allow users, to surf the Web, but only some newer ones are capable of wireless connection to the local area computer network.
[K] University officials say that they have no plans to track their students (and Apple said it would not be possible unless students give their permission). They say that they are drawn to the prospect of learning applications outside the classroom, though such lesson plans have yet to surface.
[L] “My colleagues and I are studying something called augmented reality (a field of computer research dealing with the combination of real-world and virtual reality)” said Christopher Dede, professor in learning technologies at Harvard University. “Alien Contact,” for example, is an exercise developed for middle-school students who use hand-held devices that can determine their location. As they walk around a playground or other area, text, video or audio pops up at various points to help them try to figure out why aliens were in the schoolyard.
[M] “You can imagine similar kinds of interactive activities along historical lines,” like following the Freedom Trail in Boston, Professor Dede said. “It’s important that we do research so that we know how well something like this works.”
[N] The rush to distribute the devices worries some professors, who say that students are less likely to participate in class if they are multi-tasking. “I’m not someone who’s anti-technology, but I’m always worried that technology becomes an end in and of itself, and it replaces teaching or it replaces analysis,” said Ellen Millender, associate professor of classics at Reed College in Portland, Ore. (She added that she hoped to buy an iPhone for herself once prices fall.) Robert Summers, who has taught at Cornell Law School for about 40 years, announced this week — in a detailed, footnoted memorandum — that he would ban laptop computers from his class on contract law. “I would ban that too if I knew the students were using it in class,” Professor Summers said of the iPhone, after the device and its capabilities were explained to him. “What we want to encourage in these students is an active intellectual experience, in which they develop the wide range of complex reasoning abilities required of good lawyers.”
[O] The experience at Duke University may ease some concerns. A few years ago, Duke began giving iPods to students with the idea that they might use them to record lectures (these older models could not access the Internet). “We had assumed that the biggest focus of these devices would be consuming the content,” said Tracy Futhey, vice president for information technology and chief information officer at Duke. But that is not all that the students did. They began using the iPods to create their own “content”, making audio recordings of themselves and presenting them. The students turned what could have been a passive interaction into an active one, Ms Futhey said.
46.University officials claim that they dole out iPhones and iPods so as to facilitate students’ learning outside of class.
47.In the author’s view, being equipped with IT products may help colleges and universities build an innovative image.
48.Professor Robert Summers at Cornell Law School banned laptop computers from his class because he thinks qualified lawyers need to possess a broad array of complex reasoning abilities.
49. Naomi Pugh at Freed-Hardeman University speculated that professors would have to work harder to enliven their classes.
50. The University of Maryland at College Park is proceeding with caution concerning the use of iPhones and iPods.
51. Many professors think that giving out Apple iPhones or Internet-capable iPods to students may not benefit education as intended.
52. The experience at Duke University may ease some concerns because the students have used iPods 	for active interaction.
53. Ellen Millender at Reed College in Portland is concerned that technology will take the place of teaching or analysis.
54. The distribution of iPhones among students has raised concerns that they will further distract students from class participation.
55. Experts like Dr Kyle Dickson at Abilene Christian University think that mobile technology will be more widely used in education.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　　In 2011, many shoppers chose to avoid the frantic crowds and do their holiday shopping from the comfort of their computer. Sales at online retailers gained by more than 15%, making it the biggest season ever. But people are also returning those purchases at record rates, up 8% from last year.
　　　What went wrong? Is the lingering shadow of the global financial crisis making it harder to accept extravagant indulgences? Or that people shop more impulsively — and therefore make bad decisions — when online? Both arguments are plausible. However, there is a third factor: a question of touch. We can love the look but, in an online environment, we cannot feel the quality of a texture, the shape of the fit, the fall of a fold or, for that matter, the weight of an earring. And physically interacting with an object makes you more committed to your purchase. 
　　　When my most recent book Brandwashed was released, I teamed up with a local bookstore to conduct an experiment about the differences between the online and offline shopping experience. I carefully instructed a group of volunteers to promote my book in two different ways. The first was a fairly hands-off approach. Whenever a customer would inquire about my book, the volunteer would take him over to the shelf and point to it. Out of 20 such requests, six customers proceeded with the purchase.
　　　The second option also involved going over to the shelf but, this time, removing the book and then subtly holding onto it for just an extra moment before placing it in the customer’s hands. Of the 20 people who were handed the book, 13 ended up buying it. Just physically passing the book showed a big difference in sales. Why? We feel something similar to a sense of ownership when we hold things in our hand. That’s why we establish or reestablish connection by greeting strangers and friends with a handshake. In this case, having to then let go of the book after holding it might generate a subtle sense of loss, and motivate us to make the purchase even more.
　　　A recent study also revealed the power of touch, in this case when it came to conventional mail. A deeper and longer-lasting impression of a message was formed when delivered in a letter, as opposed to receiving the same message online. Brain imaging showed that, on touching the paper, the emotional centre of the brain was activated, thus forming a stronger bond. The study also indicated that once touch becomes part of the process, it could translate into a sense of possession. This sense of ownership is simply not part of the equation in the online shopping experience.
56. Why do people prefer shopping online according to the author?

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　　Apparently everyone knows that global warming only makes climate more extreme. A hot, dry summer has triggered another flood of such claims. And, while many interests are at work, one of the players that benefits the most from this story are the media: the notion of “extreme” climate simply makes for more compelling news.
　　　Consider Paul Krugman, writing breathlessly in The New York Times about the “rising incidence of extreme events”. He claims that global warming caused the current drought in America’s Midwest, and that supposedly record-high corn prices could cause a global food crisis.
　　　But the United Nations climate panel’s latest assessment tells us precisely the opposite: For “North America, there is medium confidence that there has been an overall slight tendency towards less dryness”. Moreover, there is no way that Krugman could have identified this drought as being caused by global warming without a time machine: Climate models estimate that such detection will be possible by 2048, at the earliest.
　　　And, fortunately, this year’s drought appears unlikely to cause a food crisis, as global rice and wheat supplies remain plentiful. Moreover, Krugman overlooks inflation: Prices have increased, six-fold since 1969, so, while corn futures（期货）did set a record of about $8 per bushel（蒲式耳）in late July, the inflation-adjusted price of corn was higher throughout most of the 1970s, reaching $16 in 1974.
　　　Finally, Krugman conveniently forgets that concerns about global warming are the main reason that com prices have skyrocketed since 2005. Nowadays 40 percent of com grown in the United States is used to produce ethanol (乙醇), which does absolutely nothing for the climate, but certainly distorts the price of com — at the expense of many of the worlds poorest people.
　　　Bill McKibben similarly worries in The Guardian about the Midwest drought and com prices. He confidently tells us that raging wildfires from New Mexico and Colorado to Siberia are “exactly” what the early stages of global warming look like.
　　　In fact, the latest overview of global wildfire incidence suggests that fire intensity has declined over the past 70 years and is now close to its preindustrial level.
　　　When well-meaning campaigners want us to pay attention to global warming, they often end up pitching beyond the facts. And, while this may seem justified by a noble goal, such “policy by panic” tactics rarely work, and often backfire.
　　　Remember how, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, A1 Gore claimed that we were in store for ever more destructive hurricanes? Since then, hurricane incidence has dropped off the charts. Exaggerated claims merely fuel public distrust and disengagement.
　　　That is unfortunate, because global warming is a real problem, and we do need to address it.
61.In what way do the media benefit from extreme weather?
	A) They can attract people’s attention to their reports.
	B) They can choose from a greater variety of topics.
	C) They can make themselves better known.
	D) They can give voice to different views.
62.What is the author’s comment on Krugman’s claim about the current drought in America’s Midwest?
	A) A time machine is needed to testify to its truth.
	B) It is based on an erroneous climate model.
	C) It will eventually get proof in 2048.
	D) There is no way to prove its validity.
63.What is the chief reason for the rise in com prices according to the author?
	A) Demand for food has been rising in the developing countries.
	B) A considerable portion of com is used to produce green fuel.
	C) Climate change has caused com yields to drop markedly.
	D) Inflation rates have been skyrocketing since the 1970s.
64.What does the author say about global wildfire incidence over the past 70 years?
	A) It has got worse with the rise in extreme weathers.
	B) It signals the early stages of global warming.
	C) It has dropped greatly.
	D) It is related to drought.
65. What does the author think of the exaggerated claims in the media about global warming?
	A) They are strategies to raise public awareness.
	B) They do a disservice to addressing the problem.
	C) They aggravate public distrust about science.
	D) They create confusion about climate change.

　　　It’s difficult to estimate the number of youngsters involved in home schooling, where children are not sent to school and receive their formal education from one or both parents.    26   and court decisions have made it legally possible in most states for parents to educate their children at home, and each year more people take advantage of that opportunity. Some states require parents or a home tutor to meet teacher certification standards, and many require parents to complete legal forms to verify that their children are receiving    27   in state-approved curricula.
　　　Supporters of home education claim that it’s less expensive and far more    28   than mass public education. Moreover, they cite several advantages: alleviation of school overcrowding, strengthened family relationships, lower    29   rates, the fact that students are allowed to learn at their own rate, increased    30   , higher standardized test scores, and reduced    31   problems.
　　　Critics of the home schooling movement   32   that it creates as many problems as it solves. They acknowledge that, in a few cases, home schooling offers educational opportunities superior to those found in most public schools, but few parents can provide such educational advantages. Some parents who withdraw their children from the schools    33   home schooling have an inadequate educational background and insufficient formal training to provide a satisfactory education for their children. Typically, parents have fewer technological resources   34   than do schools. However, the relatively inexpensive computer technology that is readily available today is causing some to challenge the notion that home schooling is in any way   35   more highly structured classroom education.

Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　Cell phones provide instant access to people. They are creating a major   36   in the social experiences of both children and adolescents. In one recent U.S. survey, about half the teens polled said that their cell phone had  37   their communications with friends. Almost all said that their cell phone was the way they stayed in touch with peers, one-third had used the cell phone to help a peer in need, and about 80% said the phone made them feel safer. Teenagers in Australia,    38   , said that their mobile phones provided numerous benefits and were an
39   part of their lives; some were so   40   to their phones that the researchers considered it an addiction. In Japan, too, researchers are concerned about cell phone addiction. Researchers in one study in Tokyo found that more than half of junior high school students used their phones to exchange e-mails with schoolmates more than 10 times a day.
　　　Cell phones   41   social connections with peers across time and space. They allow young people to exchange moment-by-moment experiences in their daily lives with special partners and thus to have a more   42  sense of connection with friends. Cell phones also can   43  social tolerance because they reduce children’s interactions with others who are different from them. In addition to connecting peers, cell phones connect children and parents. Researchers studying teenagers in Israel concluded that, in that   44   environment, mobile phones were regarded as “security objects” in parent-teen relationships — important because they provided the possibility of   45  and communication at all times.

Waste Not, Want Not
　　　Feeding the 9 Billion: The Tragedy of Waste
[A] By 2075, the United Nations’ mid-range projection for global population is about 9.5 billion. This means that there could be an extra three billion mouths to feed by the end of the century, a period in which substantial changes are anticipated in the wealth, calorie intake and dietary preferences of people in developing countries across the world. Such a projection presents mankind with wide-ranging social, economic, environmental and political issues that need to be addressed today to ensure a sustainable future for all. One key issue is how to produce more food in a world of finite resources.
[B] Today, we produce about four billion metric tones of food per year. Yet due to poor practices in harvesting, storage and transportation, as well as market and consumer wastage, it is estimated that 30-50% of all food produced never reaches a human stomach. Furthermore, this figure does not reflect the fact that large amounts of land, energy, fertilisers and water have also been lost in the production of foodstuffs which simply end up as waste. This level of wastage is a tragedy that cannot continue if we are to succeed in the challenge of sustainably meeting our future food demands.
　　　Where Food Waste Happens
[C] In 2010, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers identified three principal emerging population groups across the world, based on characteristics associated with their current and projected stage of economic development.
·Fully developed, mature, post-industrial societies, such as those in Europe, characterised by stable or declining populations which are increasing in age.
·Late-stage developing nations that are currently industrialising rapidly, for example China, which will experience declining rates of population growth, coupled with increasing affluence (富裕）and age profile.
·Newly developing countries that are beginning to industrialise, primarily in Africa, with high to very high population growth rates, and characterised by a predominantly young age profile.
[D] Each group over the coming decades will need to address different issues surrounding food production, storage and transportation, as well as consumer expectations, if we are to continue to feed all our people.
[E] In less-developed countries, such as those of sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia, wastage tends to occur primarily at the farmer-producer end of the supply chain. Inefficient harvesting, inadequate local transportation and poor infrastructure（基础设施）mean that produce is frequently handled inappropriately and stored under unsuitable farm site conditions.
[F] In mature, fully developed countries such as the UK, more-efficient fanning practices and better transport, storage and processing facilities ensure that a larger proportion of the food produced reaches markets and consumers. However, characteristics associated with modem consumer culture mean produce is often wasted through retail and customer behaviour.
[G] Major supermarkets, in meeting consumer expectations, will often reject entire crops of perfectly edible fruit and vegetables at the farm because they do not meet exacting marketing standards for their physical characteristics, such as size and appearance.
[H] Of the produce that does appear in the supermarket, commonly used sales promotions frequently encourage customers to purchase excessive quantities which, in the case of perishable foodstuffs, inevitably generate wastage in the home. Overall between 30% and 50% of what has been bought in developed countries is thrown away by the purchaser.
　　　Better Use of Our Finite Resources
[I] Wasting food means losing not only life-supporting nutrition but also precious resources, including land, water and energy. As a global society, therefore, tackling food waste will help contribute towards addressing a number of key resource issues.
[J] Land Usage: Over the last five decades, improved farming techniques and technologies have helped to significantly increase crop yields along with a 12% expansion of. farmed land use. However, a further increase in farming area without impacting unfavourably on what remains of the worlds natural ecosystems appears unlikely. The challenge is that an increase in animal- based production will require more land, and resources, as livestock(牲畜)farming demands extensive land use.
[K] Water Usage: Over the past century, human use of fresh water has increased at more than double the rate of population growth. Currently about 3.8 trillion m3 of water is used by humans per year. About 70% of this is consumed by the global agriculture sector, and the level of use will continue to rise over the coming decades.
[L] Better irrigation can dramatically improve crop yield and about 40% of the worlds food supply is currently derived from irrigated land. However, water used in irrigation is often sourced unsustainably. In processing foods after the agricultural stage, there are large additional uses of water that need to be tackled in a world of growing demand. This is particularly crucial in the case of meat production, where beef uses about 50 times more water than vegetables. In the future, more effective washing techniques, management procedures, and recycling and purification of water will be needed to reduce wastage.
[M] Energy Usage: Energy is an essential resource across the entire food production cycle, with estimates showing an average of 7-10 calories of input being required in the production of one calorie of food. This varies dramatically depending on crop, from three calories for plant crops to 35 calories in the production of beef. Since much of this energy comes from the utilisation of fossil fuels, wastage of food potentially contributes to unnecessary global warming as well as inefficient resource utilisation.
[N] In the modern industrialised agricultural process — which developing nations are moving towards in order to increase future yields — energy usage in the making and application of fertilisers and pesticides represents the single biggest component. Wheat production takes 50% of its energy input for these two items alone. Indeed, on a global scale, fertiliser manufacturing consumes about 3-5% of the world’s annual natural gas supply. With production anticipated to increase by 25% between now and 2030, sustainable energy sourcing will become an increasingly major issue. Energy to power machinery, both on the farm and in the storage and processing facilities, adds to the energy total, which currently represents about 3.1% of annual global energy consumption.
　　　Recommendations
[O] Rising population combined with improved nutrition standards and shifting dietary preferences will exert pressure for increases in global food supply. Engineers, scientists and agriculturalists have the knowledge, tools and systems that will assist in achieving productivity increases. However, pressure will grow on finite resources of land, energy and water. The potential to provide 60-100% more food by simply eliminating losses, while simultaneously freeing up land, energy and water resources for other uses, is an opportunity that should not be ignored. In order to begin tackling the challenge, the Institution recommends that:
·The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation work with the international engineering community to ensure governments of developed nations put in place programmes that transfer engineering knowledge, design know-how, and suitable technology to newly developing countries. This will help improve produce handling in the harvest, and immediate post-harvest stages of food production.
·Governments of rapidly developing countries incorporate waste minimisation thinking into the transport infrastructure and storage facilities currently being planned, engineered and built.
·Governments in developed nations devise and implement policy that changes consumer expectations. These should discourage retailers from wasteful practices that lead to the rejection of food on the basis of cosmetic characteristics, and losses in the home due to excessive purchasing by consumers.
46.Elimination of waste alone can potentially provide over sixty percent more food for the growing world population.
47.The production and application of fertilisers and pesticides account for the largest part of energy use in the modem industrialised agricultural process.
48.Consumers in developed countries throw away nearly half of their food purchases because they tend to buy in excessive quantities.
49.It is recommended that engineering knowledge and suitable technology in developed countries be introduced to developing countries to improve produce handling in the harvest.
50.The predicted global population growth means that ways have to be found to produce more food with finite resources.
51.A further expansion of farming area will adversely impact on the worlds natural ecosystems.
52.Perfectly eatable fruit and vegetable crops often fail to reach supermarkets due to their size or physical appearance.
53.Poor practices in harvesting, storage and transportation have resulted in a waste of much of the food we produce and thus a waste of land and resources.
54.Food waste in less-developed countries happens mainly at the producers’ end.
55.Beef consumes far more water to produce than vegetables.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　　Call it the “learning paradox”： the more you struggle and even fail while you’re trying to learn new information, the better you’re likely to recall and apply that information later.
　　　The learning paradox is at the heart of “productive failure,” a phenomenon identified by researcher Manu Kapur. Kapur points out that while the model adopted by many teachers when introducing students to new knowledge — providing lots of structure and guidance early on, until the students show that they can do it on their own — makes intuitive sense, it may not be the best way to promote learning. Rather, it5s better to let the learners wrestle（较劲）with the material on their own for a while, refraining from giving them any assistance at the start. In a paper published recently, Kapur applied the principle of productive failure to mathematical problem solving in three schools.
　　　With one group of students, the teacher provided strong “scaffolding” — instructional support —and feedback. With the teacher’s help, these pupils were able to find the answers to their set of problems. Meanwhile, a second group was directed to solve the same problems by collaborating with one another, without any prompts from their instructor. These students weren’t able to complete the problems correctly. But in the course of trying to do so, they generated a lot of ideas about the nature of the problems and about what potential solutions would look like. And when the two groups were tested on what they’d learned, the second group “significantly outperformed” the first.
　　　The apparent struggles of the floundering（挣扎的）group have what Kapur calls a “hidden efficacy”： they lead people to understand the deep structure of problems, not simply their correct solutions. When these students encounter a new problem of the same type on a test, they’re able to transfer the knowledge they’re gathered more effectively than those who were the passive recipients of someone else’s expertise.
　　　In the real world, problems rarely come neatly packaged, so being able to discern their deep structure is key. But, Kapur notes, none of us like to fail, no matter how often Silicon Valley entrepreneurs praise the beneficial effects of an idea that fails or a start-up company that crashes and bums. So we need to “design for productive failure” by building it into the learning process. Kapur has identified three conditions that promote this kind of beneficial struggle. First, choose problems to work on that “challenge but do not frustrate.” Second, provide learners with opportunities to explain and elaborate on what they’re doing. Third, give learners the chance to compare and contrast good and bad solutions to the problems. And to those students who protest this tough-love teaching style: you’ll thank me later.
56.Why does the author call the learning process a paradox?
	A) Pains do not necessarily lead to gains.
	B) What is learned is rarely applicable in life.
	C) Failure more often than not breeds success.
	D) The more is taught, the less is learnt.
57.What does Kapur disapprove of in teaching?
	A) Asking students to find and solve problems on their own.
	B) Developing students’ ability to apply what they learn.
	C) Giving students detailed guidance and instruction.
	D) Allowing students a free hand in problem solving.
58.What do people tend to think of providing strong “scaffolding” in teaching?
	A) It will make teaching easier.
	B) It is a sensible way of teaching.
	C) It can motivate average students.
	D) It will enhance students’ confidence.
59.What kind of problem should be given to students to solve according to Kapur?
	A) It should be able to encourage collaborative learning.
	B) It should be easy enough so as not to frustrate students.
	C) It should be solvable by average students with ease.
	D) It should be difficult enough but still within their reach.
60.What can be expected of “this tough-love teaching style” (Lines 8-9, Para. 5)?
	A) Students will be grateful in the long run.
	B) Teachers will meet with a lot of resistance.	
	C) Parents will think it too harsh on their kids.
	D) It may not be able to yield the desired results.

Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　　Vernon Bowman, a 75-year-old farmer from rural Indiana, did something that got him sued. He planted soybeans（大豆）sold as cattle feed. But Monsanto, the agricultural giant, insists it has a patent on the kind of genetically modified seeds Bowman used — and that the patent continues to all of the progeny（后代）of those seeds.
　　　Have we really gotten to the point that planting a seed can lead to a high-stakes Supreme Court patent lawsuit? We have, and that case is Bowman vs. Monsanto, which is being argued on Tuesday. Monsanto’s critics have attacked the company for its “merciless legal battles against small farmers,” and they are hoping this will be the case that puts it in its place. They are also hoping the court’s ruling will rein in patent law, which is increasingly being used to claim new life forms as private property.
　　　Monsanto and its supporters, not surprisingly, see the case very differently. They argue that when a company like Monsanto goes to great expense to create a valuable new genetically modified seed, it must be able to protect its property interests. If farmers like Bowman are able to use these seeds without paying the designated fee, it will remove the incentives for companies like Monsanto to innovate.
　　　Monsanto accused Bowman of patent infringement and won an $84,456 damage award. Rather than pay up or work out a settlement, Bowman decided to appeal — all the way to the Supreme Court. He said “Monsanto should not be able, just because they’ve got billions of dollars to spend on legal fees, to try to terrify farmers into obeying their agreements by massive force and threats.”
　　　The central issue in the case is whether patent rights to living things extend to the progeny of those things. Monsanto argues that its patents extend to later generations. But Bowman’s supporters argue that Monsanto is trying to expand the scope of patents in ways that would enrich big corporations and hurt small farmers. They say that if Monsanto wins, the impact will extend far beyond agriculture — locking up property rights in an array of important areas. Knowledge Ecology International contends that the Supreme Court’s ruling could have “profound effects” on other biotech industries.
　　　If this were a Hollywood movie, the courageous old Indiana farmer would beat the profit-minded corporation before the credits rolled. But this is a real-life argument before a Supreme Court that has a well-earned reputation for looking out for the interests of large corporations. This case gives the court an opportunity to rein in the growing use of patents to protect genetically engineered crops and other life forms — but the court may well use it to give this trend a powerful new endorsement.
61.Why did Vernon Bowman get sued?
	A) He used genetically modified seeds to feed his cattle.
	B) He planted soybeans without paying for the patent.
	C) He made a profit out of Monsanto’s commercial secrets.
	D) He obtained Monsanto’s patented seeds by illegal means.
62.What are Monsanto’s critics hoping the Supreme Court will do?
	A) Allow small farmers to grow genetically modified soybeans.
	B) Punish Monsanto for infringing on small farmer’s interests.
	C) Rule against Monsanto’s excessive extension of its patent rights.
	D) Abolish the patent law concerning genetically engineered seeds.
63.What is the argument of Monsanto and its supporters?
	A) Patent rights should be protected to encourage innovation.
	B) Bowman cannot plant the seeds without Monsanto’s consent.
	C) Monsanto has the right to recover the costs of its patented seeds.
	D) Patent law on genetically modified seeds should not be challenged.
64.What is the key issue in the Bowman vs. Monsanto case?
	A) Whether patent for seeds is harmful to agricultural production.
	B) Whether the biotech industry should take priority over agriculture.
	C) Whether measures should be introduced to protect small farmers.
	D) Whether patent for living things applies to their generations.
65.What do we learn from the last paragraph?
	A) Hollywood movies usually have an unexpected, dramatic impact on real-life arguments.
	B) The Supreme Court will try to change its reputation for supporting large corporations.
	C) The Supreme Court is likely to persuade the parties concerned to work out a settlement.
	D) The ruling would be in Bowman’s favor if the case were argued in a Hollywood movie.

Part Ⅲ                                       	 Reading Comprehension
Section A
Directions： In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word far each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　Some performance evaluations require supervisors to take action. Employees who receive a very favorable evaluation may deserve some type of recognition or even a promotion. If supervisors do not acknowledge such outstanding performance, employees may either lose their 36   and reduce their effort or search for a new job at a firm that will  37  them for high performance. Supervisors should acknowledge high performance so that the employee will continue to perform well in the future.
　　　Employees who receive unfavorable evaluations must also be given attention. Supervisors must 38   the reasons for poor performance. Some reasons, such as a family illness, may have a temporary adverse   39   on performance and can be corrected. Other reasons, such as a bad attitude, may not be temporary. When supervisors give employees an unfavorable evaluation, they must decide whether to take any   40   actions. If the employees were unaware of their own deficiencies, the unfavorable evaluation can pinpoint（指出）the deficiencies that employees must correct. In this case, the supervisor may simply need to monitor the employees   41   and ensure that the deficiencies are corrected.
　　　If the employees were already aware of their deficiencies before the evaluation period, however, they may be unable or unwilling to correct them. This situation is more serious, and the supervisor may need to take action. The action should be    42    with the firm’s guidelines and may include reassigning the employees to new jobs,   43   them temporarily, or firing them. A supervisor’s action toward a poorly performing worker can   44   the attitudes of other employees.

The College Essay: Why Those 500 Words Drive Us Crazy
[A] Meg is a lawyer-mom in suburban Washington, D.C., where lawyer-moms are thick on the ground. Her son Doug is one of several hundred thousand high-school seniors who had a painful fall. The deadline for applying to his favorite college was Nov. 1, and by early October he had yet to fill out the application. More to the point, he had yet to settle on a subject for the personal essay accompanying the application. According to college folklore, a well-turned essay has the power to seduce (诱惑）an admissions committee. “He wanted to do one thing at a time,” Meg says, explaining her son’s delay. “But really, my son is a huge procrastinator (拖延者). The essay is the hardest thing to do, so he’s put it off the longest.” Friends and other veterans of the process have warned Meg that the back and forth between editing parent and writing student can be traumatic（痛苦的）.
[B] Back in the good old days — say, two years ago, when the last of my children suffered the ordeal (折磨)—a high-school student applying to college could procrastinate all the way to New Year’s Day of their senior year, assuming they could withstand the parental pestering (烦扰). But things change fast in the nail-biting world of college admissions. The recent trend toward early decision and early action among selective colleges and universities has pushed the traditional deadline of January up to Nov. 1 or early December for many students.
[C] If the time for heel-dragging has been shortened, the true source of the anxiety and panic remains what it has always been. And ifs not the application itself. A college application is a relatively straightforward questionnaire asking for the basics: name, address, family history, employment history. It would all be innocent enough — 20 minutes of busy work — except it comes attached to a personal essay.
[D] “There are good reasons it causes such anxiety,” says Lisa Sohmer, director of college counseling at the Garden School in Jackson Heights, N.Y. “It’s not just the actual writing. By now everything else is already set. Your course load is set, your grades are set, your test scores are set. But the essay is something you can still control, and it’s open-ended. So the temptation is to write and rewrite and rewrite.” Or stall and stall and stall.
[E] The application essay, along with its mythical importance, is a recent invention. In the 1930s, when only one in 10 Americans had a degree from a four-year college, an admissions committee was content to ask for a sample of applicants’ school papers to assess their writing ability. By the 1950s, most schools required a brief personal statement of why the student had chosen to apply to one school over another.
[F] Today nearly 70 percent of graduating seniors go off to college, including two-year and four- year institutions. Even apart from the increased competition, the kids enter a process that has been utterly transformed from the one baby boomers knew. Nearly all application materials are submitted online, and the Common Application provides a one-size-fits form accepted by more than 400 schools, including the nation’s most selective.
[G] Those schools usually require essays of their own, but the longest essay, 500 words maximum, is generally attached to the Common Application. Students choose one of six questions. Applicants are asked to describe an ethical dilemma they’ve faced and its impact on them, or discuss a public issue of special concern to them, or tell of a fictional character or creative work that has profoundly influenced them. Another question invites them to write about the importance (to them, again) of diversity — a word that has assumed magic power in American higher education. The most popular option: write on a topic of your choice.
[H] “Boys in particular look at the other questions and say, ‘Oh, that’s too much work,’” says John Boshoven, a counselor in the Ann Arbor, Mich., public schools. “They think if they do a topic of their choice, ‘I’ll just go get that history paper I did last year on the Roman Empire and turn it into a first-person application essay!’ And they end up producing something utterly ridiculous.”
[I] Talking to admissions professionals like Boshoven, you realize that the list of “don’ts” in essay writing is much longer than the “dos.” “No book reports, no history papers, no character studies,” says Sohmer.
[J]  ‘‘It drives you crazy, how easily kids slip into cliches(老生常谈)says Boshoven.“They don’t realize how typical their experiences are. ‘I scored the winning goal in soccer against our arch- rival’ ‘My grandfather served in World War II, and I hope to be just like him someday.’ That may mean a lot to that particular kid. But in the world of the application essay, it’s nothing. You’ll lose the reader in the first paragraph.”
[K] “The greatest strength you bring to this essay,” says the College Board’s how-to book, “is 17 years or so of familiarity with the topic: YOU. The form and style are very familiar, and best of all, you are the world-class expert on the subject of YOU ... It has been the subject of your close scrutiny every morning since you were tall enough to see into the bathroom mirror. The key word in the Common Application prompts is “you.”
[L] The college admission essay contains the grandest American themes — status anxiety, parental piety（孝顺）intellectual standards — and so it is only a matter of time before it becomes infected by the country’s culture of excessive concern with self-esteem. Even if the question is ostensibly （表面上) about something outside the self (describe a fictional character or solve a problem of geopolitics), the essay invariably returns to the favorite topic: what is its impact on YOU?
[M] “For all the anxiety the essay causes,” says Bill McClintick of Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania, “it’s a very small piece of the puzzle. I was in college admissions for 10 years. I saw kids and parents beat themselves up over this. And at the vast majority of places, it is simply not a big variable in the college’s decision-making process.”
[N] Many admissions officers say they spend less than a couple of minutes on each application, including the essay. According to a recent survey of admissions officers, only one in four private colleges say the essay is of “considerable importance” in judging an application. Among public colleges and universities, the number drops to roughly one in 10. By contrast, 86 percent place “considerable importance” on an applicant’s grades, 70 percent on “strength of curriculum.”
[O] Still, at the most selective schools, where thousands of candidates may submit identically high grades and test scores, a marginal item like the essay may serve as a tie-breaker between two equally qualified candidates. The thought is certainly enough to keep the pot boiling under parents like Meg, the lawyer-mom, as she tries to help her son choose an essay topic. For a moment the other day, she thought she might have hit on a good one. “His father’s from France,” she says. “I said maybe you could write about that, as something that makes you different. You know: half French, half American. I said, “You could write about your identity issues.’ He said, ‘I don’t have any identity issues!’ And he’s right. He’s a well-adjusted, normal kid. But that doesn’t make for a good essay, does it?”
46.Today many universities require their applicants to write an essay of up to five hundred words.
47.One recent change in college admissions is that selective colleges and universities have moved the traditional deadline to earlier dates.
48.Applicants and their parents are said to believe that the personal essay can sway the admissions committee.
49.Applicants are usually better off if they can write an essay that distinguishes them from the rest.
50.Not only is the competition getting more intense, the application process today is also totally different from what baby boomers knew.
51.In writing about their own experiences many applicants slip into cliches, thus failing to engage the reader.
52.According to a recent survey, most public colleges and universities consider an applicant’s grades highly important.
53.Although the application essay causes lots of anxiety, it does not play so important a role in the college’s decision-making process.
54.The question you are supposed to write about may seem outside the self, but the theme of the essay should center around its impact on you.
55.In the old days, applicants only had to submit a sample of their school papers to show their
　　writing ability.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　　Among the government’s most interesting reports is one that estimates what parents spend on their children. Not surprisingly, the costs are steep. For a middle-class, husband-and-wife family (average pretax income in 2009: $76,250), spending per child is about $12,000 a year. With inflation the family’s spending on a child will total $286,050 by age 17.
　　　The dry statistics ought to inform the ongoing deficit debate, because a budget is not just a catalog of programs and taxes. It reflects a society’s priorities and values. Our society does not 一 despite rhetoric (说辞) to the contrary — put much value on raising children. Present budget policies tax parents heavily to support the elderly. Meanwhile, tax breaks for children are modest. If deficit reduction aggravates these biases, more Americans may choose not to have children or to have fewer children. Down that path lies economic decline.	
　　　Societies that cannot replace their populations discourage investment and innovation. They have stagnant（萧条的）or shrinking markets for goods and services. With older populations, they resist change. To stabilize its population — discounting immigration — women must have an average of two children. That’s a fertility rate of 2.0. Many countries with struggling economies are well below that.
　　　Though having a child is a deeply personal decision, it’s shaped by culture, religion, economics, and government policy. “No one has a good answer” as to why fertility varies among countries, says sociologist Andrew Cherlin of The Johns Hopkins University. Eroding religious belief in Europe may partly explain lowered birthrates. In Japan young women may be rebelling against their mothers’ isolated lives of child rearing. General optimism and pessimism count. Hopefulness fueled America’s baby boom. After the Soviet Union’s collapse, says Cherlin, “anxiety for the future” depressed birthrates in Russia and Eastern Europe.
　　　In poor societies, people have children to improve their economic well-being by increasing the number of family workers and providing support for parents in their old age. In wealthy societies, the logic often reverses. Government now supports the elderly, diminishing the need for children. By some studies, the safety nets for retirees have reduced fertility rates by 0.5 children in the United States and almost 1.0 in Western Europe, reports economist Robert Stein in the journal National Affairs. Similarly, some couples don’t have children because they don’t want to sacrifice their own lifestyles to the time and expense of a family.
　　　Young Americans already face a bleak labor market that cannot instill (注入) confidence about having children. Piling on higher taxes won’t help. “If higher taxes make it more expensive to raise children, says Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute, “people will think twice about having another child.” That seems like common sense, despite the multiple influences on becoming parents.
56.What do we learn from the government report?
	A) Inflation increases families’ expenses.
	B) Raising children is getting expensive.
	C) Budget reduction is around the comer.
	D) Average family expenditure is increasing.
57.What is said to be the consequence of a shrinking population?
	A) Weakened national strength.	C) Economic downturn.
	B) Increased immigration.	D) Social instability.
58.What accounted for America’s baby boom?
	A) Optimism for the future.	C) Religious beliefs.
	B) Improved living conditions.	D) Economic prosperity.
59.Why do people in wealthy countries prefer to have fewer children?
	A) They want to further improve their economic well-being.
	B) They cannot afford the time and expenses of rearing children.
	C) They are concerned about the future of the coming generation.
	D) They don’t rely on their children to support them in old age.
60.What is the author’s purpose in writing the passage?
	A) To instill confidence in the young about raising children.
	B) To advise couples to think twice before having children.
	C) To encourage the young to take care of the elderly.	.
	D) To appeal for tax reduction for raising children.
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　　Space exploration has always been the province of dreamers: The human imagination readily soars where human ingenuity (创造力）struggles to follow, A Voyage to the Moon, often cited as the first science fiction story, was written by Cyrano de Bergerac in 1649. Cyrano was dead and buried for a good three centuries before the first manned rockets started to fly.
　　　In 1961, when President Kennedy declared that America would send a man to the moon by the decade’s end, those words, too, had a dreamlike quality. They resonated（共鸣）with optimism and ambition in much the same way as the most famous dream speech of all, delivered by Martin Luther King Jr. two years later. By the end of the decade, both visions had yielded concrete results and transformed American society. And yet in many ways the two dreams ended up at odds with each other. The fight for racial and economic equality is intensely pragmatic (讲求实用的）and immediate in its impact. The urge to explore space is just the opposite. It is figuratively and literally otherworldly in its aims.
　　　When the dust settled, the space dreamers lost out. There was no grand follow-up to the Apollo missions. The technologically compromised space shuttle program has just come to an end, with no successor. The perpetual argument is that funds are tight, that we have more pressing problems here on Earth. Amid the current concerns about the federal deficit, reaching toward the stars seems a dispensable luxury — as if saving one-thousandth of a single year’s budget would solve our problems.
　　　But human ingenuity struggles on. NASA is developing a series of robotic probes that will get the most bang from a buck. They will serve as modem Magellans, mapping out the solar system for whatever explorers follow, whether man or machine. On the flip side, companies like Virgin Galactic are plotting a bottom-up assault on the space dream by making it a reality to the public. Private spaceflight could lie within reach of rich civilians in a few years. Another decade or two and it could go mainstream.
　　　The space dreamers end up benefiting all of us — not just because of the way they expand human knowledge, or because of the spin-off technologies they produce, but because the two types of dreams feed off each other. Both Martin Luther King and John Kennedy appealed to the idea that humans can transcend what were once considered inherent limitations. Today we face seeming challenges in energy, the environment, health care. Tomorrow we will transcend these as well, and the dreamers will deserve a lot of the credit. The more evidence we collect that our species is capable of greatness, the more we will actually achieve it.
61.The author mentions Cyrano de Bergerac in order to show that	.
	A) imagination is the mother of invention
	B) ingenuity is essential for science fiction writers
	C) it takes patience for humans to realize their dreams
	D) dreamers have always been interested in science fiction
62.How did the general public view Kennedy’s space exploration plan?
	A) It symbolized the American spirit.	C)It sounded very much like a dream.
	B) It was as urgent as racial equality.	D)It made an ancient dream come true.
63.What does the author say about America’s aim to explore space?
	A) It may not bring about immediate economic gains.
	B) It cannot be realized without technological innovation.
	C) It will not help the realization of racial and economic equality.
	D)   It cannot be achieved without a good knowledge of the other worlds.
64.What is the author’s attitude toward space programs?
	A) Critical.	C)Unbiased.
	B) Reserved.	D)Supportive.
65.What does the author think of the problems facing human beings?
	A) They pose a serious challenge to future human existence.
	B) They can be solved sooner or later with human ingenuity.
	C) Their solutions need joint efforts of the public and private sectors.
	D) They can only be solved by people with optimism and ambition.
Part IV                                    	Translation
Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to translate a passage from Chinese into English. You should write your answer on Answer Sheet 2.

　　　It is important that we be mindful of the earth, the planet out of which we are born and by which
we are nourished, guided, healed — the planet, however, which we have   26   to a considerable degree in these past two centuries of    27   exploitation. This exploitation has reached such   28     that presently it appears that some hundreds of thousands of species will be   29    before the end of the century. 
　　　In our times, human shrewdness has mastered the deep    30   of the earth at a level far beyond the capacities of earlier peoples. We can break the mountains apart; we can drain the rivers and flood the valleys. We can turn the most luxuriant forests into throwaway paper products. We can   31  the great grass cover of the western plains and pour   32   chemicals into the soil until the soil is dead and blows away in the wind. We can pollute the air with acids, the rivers with sewage (污水), the seas with oil. We can invent computers    33   processing ten million calculations per second. And why? To increase the volume and the speed with which we move natural resources through the consumer economy to the junk pile or the waste heap. Our managerial skills are measured by the competence    34        in accelerating this process. If in these activities the physical features of the planet are damaged, if the environment is made inhospitable for    35   living species, then so be it. We are, supposedly, creating a technological wonderworld.

Section A
Directions： In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word far each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　Quite often, educators tell families of children who are learning English as a second language to speak only English, and not their native language, at home. Although these educators may have good    36    their advice to families is misguided, and it    37   from misunderstandings about the process of language acquisition. Educators may fear that children hearing two languages will become   38 confused and thus their language development will be   39    ; this concern is not documented in the literature. Children are capable of learning more than one language, whether   40   or sequentially（依次地）In fact, most children outside of the United States are expected to becoming bilingual or even, in many cases, multilingual. Globally, knowing more than one language is viewed as an   41   and even a necessity in many areas.
　　　It is also of concern that the misguided advice that students should speak only English is given primarily to poor families with limited educational opportunities, not to wealthier families who have many educational advantages. Since children from poor families often are   42   as at-risk for academic failure, teachers believe that advising families to speak English only is appropriate. Teachers consider learning two languages to be too   43   for children from poor families, believing that the children are already burdened by their home situations.
　　　If families do not know English or have limited English skills themselves, how can they communicate in English? Advising non-English-speaking families to speak only English is    44   to telling them not to communicate with or interact with their children. Moreover, the   45   message is that the family’s native language is not important or valued.
A) asset                            I) permanently
B) delayed                       J) prevalent

H) overwhelming
Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
The Uses of Difficulty
The brain likes a challenge — and putting a few obstacles in its way may well boost its creativity.
[A] Jack White, the former frontman of the White Stripes and an influential figure among fellow musicians, likes to make things difficult for himself. He uses cheap guitars that won’t stay in shape or in tune. When performing, he positions his instruments in a way that is deliberately inconvenient, so that switching from guitar to organ mid-song involves a mad dash across the stage. Why? Because he’s on the run from what he describes as a disease that preys on every artist: “ease of use”. When making music gets too easy, says White, it becomes harder to make it sing.
[B] It’s an odd thought. Why would anyone make their work more difficult than it already is? Yet we know that difficulty can pay unexpected dividends. In 1966, soon after the Beatles had finished work on “Rubber Soul”, Paul McCartney looked into the possibility of going to America to record their next album. The equipment in American studios was more advanced than anything in Britain, which had led the Beatles’ great rivals, the Rolling Stones, to make their latest album. “Aftermath”, in Los Angeles. McCartney found that	EMI’s(百代唱片）contractual clauses made it prohibitively expensive to follow suit, and the Beatles had to make do with the primitive technology of Abbey Road.
[C] Lucky for us. Over the next two years they made their most groundbreaking work, turning the recording studio into a magical instrument of its own. Precisely because they were working with old-fashioned machines, George Martin and his team of engineers were forced to apply every ounce of their creativity to solve the problems posed to them by Lennon and McCartney. Songs like “Tomorrow Never Knows”. “Strawberry Fields Forever”, and “A Day in the Life” featured revolutionary sound effects that dazzled and mystified Martini American counterparts.
[D] Sometimes it’s only when a difficulty is removed that we realise that it was doing for us. For more than two decades, starting in the 1960s, the poet Ted Hughes sat on the judging panel of an annual poetry competition for British schoolchildren. During the 1980s he noticed an increasing number of long poems among the submissions, with some running to 70 or 80 pages. These poems were verbally inventive and fluent, but also “strangely boring”. After making inquiries Hughes discovered that they were being composed on computers, then just finding their way into British homes.
[E] You might have thought any tool which enables a writer to get words on to the page would be an advantage. But there may be a cost to such facility. In an interview with the Paris Review Hughes speculated that when a person puts pen to paper, “you meet the terrible resistance of what happened your first year at it, when you couldn’t write at all”. As the brain attempts to force the unsteady hand to do its bidding, the tension between the two results in a more compressed, psychologically denser expression. Remove that resistance and you are more likely to produce a 70-page ramble (不着边际的长篇大论).
[F] Our brains respond better to difficulty than we imagine. In schools, teachers and pupils alike often assume that if a concept has been easy to learn, then the lesson has been successful. But numerous studies have now found that when classroom material is made harder to absorb, pupils retain more of it over the long term, and understand it on a deeper level.
[G] As a poet, Ted Hughes had an acute sensitivity to the way in which constraints on self-expression, like the disciplines of metre and rhyme（韵律）, spur creative thought. What applies to poets and musicians also applies to our daily lives. We tend to equate（等同）happiness with freedom, but, as the psychotherapist and writer Adam Phillips has observed, without obstacles to our desires it’s harder to know what we want, or where we’re heading. He tells the story of a patient, a first-time mother who complained that her young son was always clinging to her, wrapping himself around her legs wherever she went. She never had a moment to herself, she said, because her son was “always in the way”. When Phillips asked her where she would go if he wasn’t in the way, she replied cheerfully, “Oh, I wouldn’t know where I was!”
[H] Take another common obstacle: lack of money. People often assume that more money will make them happier. But economists who study the relationship between money and happiness have consistently found that, above a certain income, the two do not reliably correlate. Despite the ease with which the rich can acquire almost anything they desire, they are just as likely to be unhappy as the middle classes. In this regard at least, F. Scott Fitzgerald was wrong.
[I] Indeed, ease of acquisition is the problem. The novelist Edward St Aubyn has a narrator remark of the very rich that, “not having to consider affordability, their desires rambled on like unstoppable bores, relentless (持续不断的）and whimsical (反复无常的）at the same time.” When Boston College, a private research university, wanted a better feel for its potential donors, it asked the psychologist Robert Kenny to investigate the mindset of the super-rich. He surveyed 165 households, most of which had a net worth of $25m or more. He found that many of his subjects were confused by the infinite options their money presented them with. They found it hard to know what to want, creating a kind of existential bafflement. One of them put it like this: “You know, Bob, you can just buy so much stuff, and when you get to the point where you can just buy so much stuff, now what are you going to do?”
[J] The internet makes information billionaires out of all of us, and the architects of our online experiences are catching on to the need to make things creatively difficult. Twitter’s huge success is rooted in the simple but profound insight that in a medium with infinite space for self-expression, the most interesting thing we can do is restrict ourselves to 140 characters. The music service This Is My Jam helps people navigate the tens of millions of tracks now available instantly via Spotify and iTunes. Users pick their favourite song of the week to share with others. They only get to choose one. The service was only launched this year, but by the end of September 650,000 jams had been chosen. Its co-founder Matt Ogle explains its raisondetre (存在的理由)like this: “In an age of endless choice, we were missing a way to say: ‘This. This is the one you should listen to.”
[K] Today’s world offers more opportunity than ever to follow the advice of the Walker Brothers and make it easy on ourselves. Compared with a hundred years ago, our lives are less tightly bound by social norms and physical constraints. Technology has cut out much of life’s donkey work, and we have more freedoms than ever: we can wear what we like and communicate with hundreds of friends at once at the click of a mouse. Obstacles are everywhere disappearing. Few of us wish to turn the clock back, but perhaps we need to remind ourselves how useful the right obstacles can be. Sometimes, the best route to fulfillment is the path of more resistance.
46.The rigorous requirements placed on the writing of poetry stimulate the poet’s creativity.
47.With creativity, even old-fashioned instruments may produce spectacular sound effects.
48.More money does not necessarily bring greater happiness.
49.It is a false assumption that lessons should be made easier to learn.
50.Obstacles deliberately placed in the creation of music contribute to its success.
51.Those who enjoy total freedom may not find themselves happy.
52.Ted Hughes discovered many long poems submitted for poetry competition were composed on computers.	
53.Maybe we need to bear in mind that the right obstacles help lead us to greater achievements.
54.An investigation found that many of the super-rich were baffled by the infinite choices their money made available.
55.One free social networking website turned out to be successful because it limited each posting to one hundred and forty characters.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　　There was a time not long ago when new science Ph.D.s in the United Stated were expected to pursue a career path in academia（学术界）.But today, most graduates end up working outside academia, not only in industry but also in careers such as science policy, communications, and patent law. Partly this is a result of how bleak the academic job market is, but there’s also a rising awareness of career options that Ph.D. scientists haven’t trained for directly — but for which they have useful knowledge, skills, and experience. Still, there’s a huge disconnect between the way we currently train scientists and the actual employment opportunities available for them, and an urgent need for dramatic improvements in training programs to help close the gap. One critical step that could help to drive change would be to require Ph.D. students and postdoctoral scientists to follow an individual development plan (IDP).
　　　In 2002, the U.S. Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology recommended that every postdoctoral researcher put together an IDP in consultation with an adviser. Since then, several academic institutions have begun to require IDPs for postdocs. And in June, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group recommended that the NIH require IDPs for the approximately 32,000 postdoctoral researchers they support. Other funding agencies, public and private, are moving in a similar direction.
　　　IDPs have long been used by government agencies and the private sector to achieve specific goals for the employee and the organization. The aim is to ensure that employees have an explicit tool to help them understand their own abilities and aspirations, determine career possibilities, and set (usually short-term) goals. In science, graduate students and new Ph.D. scientists can use an IDP to identify and navigate an effective career path.
　　　A new Web application for this purpose, called my IDP, has become available this week. It’s designed to guide early-career scientists through a confidential, rigorous process of introspection (内省）to create a customized career plan. Guided by expert knowledge from a panel of science- focused career advisers, each trainee’s self-assessment is used to rank a set of career trajectories (轨迹). After the user has identified a long-term career goal, my IDP walks her or him through the process of setting short-term goals directed toward accumulating new skills and experiences important for that career choice.
　　　Although surveys reveal the IDP process to be useful, trainees report a need for additional resources to help them identify a long-term career path and complete an IDP. Thus, my IDP will be most effective when ifs embedded in larger career-development efforts. For example, universities could incorporate IDPs into their graduate curricula to help students discuss, plan, prepare for, and achieve their long-term goals.
56.What do we learn about new science Ph.D.s in the United States today?
	A) They lack the skills and expertise needed for their jobs.
	B) They can choose from a wider range of well-paying jobs.
	C) They often have to seek jobs outside the academic circle.
	D) They are regarded as the nation’s driving force of change.
57.What does the author say about America’s Ph.D. training?
	A) It should be improved to better suit the job market.
	B) It is closely linked to future career requirements.
	C) It should be re-oriented to careers outside academia.
	D) It includes a great variety of practical courses.
58.What was recommended for Ph.D.s and postdoctoral researchers?
	A) They meet the urgent needs of the corporate world.
	B) A long-term career goal be set as early as possible.
	C) An IDP be made in consultation with an adviser.
	D) They acquire an explicit tool to help obtain jobs.
59.Government agencies and the private sector often use IDPs to	.
	A) bring into fall play the skills and expertise of their postdoctoral researchers
	B) help employees make the best use of their abilities to achieve their career goals
	C) place employees in the most appropriate positions
	D) hire the most suitable candidates to work for them
60.What do we know about my IDP?
	A) It is an effective tool of self-assessment and introspection for better career plans.
	B) It enables people to look into various possibilities and choose the career they love.
	C) It promises a long-term career path.
	D) It is part of the graduate curricula.
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　　Just over a decade into the 21st century, women’s progress can be celebrated across a range of fields. They hold the highest political offices from Thailand to Brazil, Costa Rica to Australia. A woman holds the top spot at the International Monetary Fund; another won the Noble Prize in economics. Self-made billionaires in Beijing, tech innovators in Silicon Valley, pioneering justices in Ghana — in these and countless other areas, women are leaving their mark.
　　　But hold the applause. In Saudi Arabia, women aren’t allowed to drive. In Pakistan, 1,000 women die in honor killings every year. In the developed world, women lag behind men in pay and political power. The poverty rate among women in the U.S. rose to 14.5% last year.
　　　To measure the state of women’s progress, Newsweek ranked 165 countries, looking at five areas that affect women’s lives: treatment under the law, workforce participation, political power, and access to education and health care. Analyzing data from the United Nations and the World Economic Forum, among others, and consulting with experts and academics, we measured 28 factors to come up with our rankings.
　　　Countries with the highest scores tend to be clustered in the West, where gender discrimination is against the law, and equal rights are constitutionally enshrined（神圣化）But there were some surprises. Some otherwise high-ranking countries had relatively low scores for political representation. Canada ranked third overall but 26th in power, behind countries such as Cuba and Burundi. Does this suggest that a woman in a nation’s top office translates to better lives for women in general? Not exactly. “Trying to quantify or measure the impact of women in politics is hard because in very few counties have there been enough women in politics to make a difference,” says Anne-Marie Goetz, peace and security adviser for U.N. Women.
　　　Of course, no index can account for everything. Declaring that one country is better than another in the way that it treats more than half its citizens means relying on broad strokes and generalities. Some things simply can’t be measured. And cross-cultural comparisons can’t account for differences of opinion.
　　　Certain conclusions are nonetheless clear. For one thing, our index backs up a simple but profound statement made by Hillary Clinton at the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. “When we liberate the economic potential of women, we elevate the economic performance of communities, nations, and the world,” she said. “There’s a stimulative effect that kicks in when women have greater access to jobs and the economic lives of our countries: Greater political stability. Fewer military conflicts. More food. More educational opportunity for children. By harnessing the economic potential of all women, we boost opportunity for all people.”
61.What does the author think about women’s progress so far?
	A) It still leaves much to be desired.
	B) It is too remarkable to be measured.
	C) It has greatly changed women’s fate.
	D) It is achieved through hard struggle.
62.In what countries have women made the greatest progress?
	A) Where women hold key posts in government.
	B) Where women’s rights are protected by law.
	C) Where women’s participation in management is high.
	D) Where women enjoy better education and health care.
63.What do Newsweek rankings reveal about women in Canada?
	A) They care little about political participation.
	B) They are generally treated as equals by men.
	C) They have a surprisingly low social status.
	D) They are underrepresented in politics.
64.What does Anne-Marie Goetz think of a woman being in a nation’s top office?
	A) It does not necessarily raise women’s political awareness.
	B) It does not guarantee a better life for the nation’s women.
	C) It enhances women’s status.
	D) It boosts women’s confidence.
65.What does Hillary Clinton suggest we do to make the world a better place?
	A) Give women more political power.
	B) Stimulate women’s creativity.
	C) Allow women access to education.
	D) Tap women’s economic potential.

　　The first copyright law in the United States was passed by Congress in 1790. In 1976 Congress enacted the latest copyright law,    26    the technological developments that had occurred since the passage of the Copyright Act of 1909. For example, in 1909, anyone who wanted to make a single copy of a    27    work for personal use had to do so by hand. The very process    28    a limitation on the quantity of materials copied. Today, a photocopier can do the work in seconds: the limitation has disappeared. The 1909 law did not provide full protection for films and sound recordings, nor did it    29    the need to protect radio and television. As a result,    30    of the law and abuses of the intent of the law have lessened the    31   rewards of authors, artists, and producers. The 1976 Copyright Act has not prevented these abuses fully, but it has clarified the legal rights of the injured parties and given them an    32    for remedy.
　　Since 1976 the Act has been   33   to include computer software, and guidelines have been adopted for fair use of television broadcasts. These changes have cleared up much of the confusion and conflict that followed    34    the 1976 legislation.
　　The fine points of the law are decided by the courts and by acceptable common practice over time. As these decisions and agreements are made, we modify our behavior accordingly. For now, we need to   35   the law and its guidelines as accurately as we can and to act in a fair manner.
Part Ⅲ	Reading Comprehension	(40 minutes)
Section A
Directions： In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　Fear can be an effective way to change behavior. One study compared the effects of high-fear and low-fear appeals on changes in attitudes and behaviors related to dental hygiene (卫生）. One group of subjects was shown awful pictures of   36   teeth and diseased gums； another group was shown less frightening materials such as plastic teeth, charts, and graphs. Subjects who saw the frightening materials reported more anxiety and a greater   37   to change the way they took care of their teeth than the low-fear group did.
　　But were these reactions actually    38    into better dental hygiene practices? To answer this important question, subjects were called back to the laboratory on two    39    (five days and six weeks after the experiment). They chewed disclosing wafers(牙疾诊断片) that give a red stain to any uncleaned areas of the teeth and thus provided a direct    40    of how well they were really taking care of their teeth. The result showed that the high-fear appeal did actually result in greater and more    41   changes in dental hygiene. That is, the subjects    42    to high-fear warnings brushed their teeth more    43    than did those who saw low-fear warnings.
　　　However ,  to be an effective persuasive device it is very important that the message not be too frightening and that people be given    44    guidelines to help them to reduce the cause of the fear. If this isn’t done, they may reduce their anxiety by denying the message or the    45    of the communicator. If that happens, it is unlikely that either attitude or behavior change will occur.

Section B
Directions： In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
The Street-Level Solution
[A] When I was growing up, one of my father’s favorite sayings (borrowed from the humorist Will Rogers) was： “It isn’t what we don’t know that causes the trouble； it’s what we think we know that just isn’t so. One of the main insights to be taken from the 100 000 Homes Campaign and its strategy to end chronic homelessness is that, until recently, our society thought it understood the nature of homelessness, but it didn’t.
[B] That led to a series of mistaken assumptions about why people become homeless and what they need. Many of the errors in our homelessness policies have stemmed from the conception that the homeless are a homogeneous group. It’s only in the past 15 years that organizations like Common Ground, and others, have taken a street-level view of the problem—distinguishing the “episodically homeless” from the “chronically homeless” in order to understand their needs at an individual level. This is why we can now envisage a different approach—and get better results.
[C] Most readers expressed support for the effort, although a number were skeptical, and a few utterly dismissive, about the chances of long-term homeless people adapting well to housing. This is to be expected; it’s hard to imagine what we haven’t yet seen. As Niccolo Machiavelli wrote in The Prince, one of the major obstacles in any effort to advance systemic change is the “incredulity of men，” which is to say that people “do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.”  Most of us have witnessed homeless people on the streets for decades. Few have seen formerly homeless people after they have been housed successfully. We don’t have reference points for that story. So we generalize from what we know-or think we know.
[D] But that can be misleading, even to experts. When I asked Rosanne Haggerty, founder of Common Ground, which currently operates 2 310 units of supportive housing (with 552 more under construction), what had been her biggest surprise in this work, she replied : “Fifteen years ago, I would not have believed that people who had been so broken and stuck in homelessness could thrive to the degree that they do in our buildings. ’’ And Becky Kanis, the campaign’s director, commented : ‘There is this sense in our minds that someone who’s on the streets is almost in their DNA different from someone who has a house. The campaign is creating a first-hand experience for many people that that is really not the case.
[E] One of the startling realizations that I had while researching this column is that anybody could become like a homeless person —all it takes is a traumatic (创伤的）brain injury. A bicycle fall, a car accident, a slip on the ice, or if you’re a soldier, a head wound—and your life could become unrecognizable. James O’Connell, a doctor who has been treating the most vulnerable homeless people on the streets of Boston for 25 years, estimates that 40 percent of the long-term homeless people he’s met had such a brain injury. “For many it was a head injury prior to the time they became homeless，” he said. “They became unpredictable. They’d have mood swings, fits of explosive behavior. They couldn’t hold onto their jobs. Drinking made them feel better. They’d end up on the streets.
[F] Once homeless people return to housing, they’re in a much better position to rebuild their lives. But it’s important to note that housing alone is not enough. As with many complex social problems, when you get through the initial crisis, you have another problem to solve which is no less challenging. But it is a better problem.
[G] Over the past decade, O’Connell has seen this happen. spend half my time on the streets or in the hospital and the other half making house calls to people who lived for years on the streets,” he said. “So from a doctor’s point of view it’s a delightful switch, but it’s not as if putting someone in housing is the answer to addressing all of their problems. It’s the first step. ”
[H] Once in housing, formerly homeless people can become isolated and lonely. If they’ve lived on the streets for years, they may have acquired a certain standing as well as a sense of pride in their survival skills. Now indoors, those aspects of their identity may be stripped away. Many also experience a profound disorientation at the outset. “If you’re homeless for more than six months, you kind of lose your bearings, ”says Haggerty. “Existence becomes not about overcoming homelessness but about finding food, begging, looking for a job to survive another day. The whole process of how you define stability gets reordered. ” 
[I] Many need regular, if not continuous, support with mental health problems, addictions and illnesses— and, equally important, assistance in the day-to-day challenges of life, reacquainting with family, building relationships with neighbors, finding enjoyable activities or work, managing finances, and learning how to eat healthy food.
[J] For some people, the best solution is to live in a communal(集体)residence, with special services. This isn’t available everywhere, however. In Boston, for example, homeless people tend to be scattered in apartments throughout the city.
[K] Common Ground’s large residences in New York offer insight into the possibilities for change when homeless people have a rich array of supports. In addition to more traditional social services, residents also make use of communal gardens, classes in things like cooking, yoga, theatre and photography, and job placement. Last year, 188 formerly homeless tenants in four of Common Ground^ residences, found jobs.
[L] Because the properties have many services and are well-managed, Haggerty has found posthousing problems to be surprisingly rare. In the past 10 years, there have been only a handful of incidents of quarrels between tenants. There is very little graffiti(涂鸦）or vandalism (破坏）. And the turnover is almost negligible. In the Prince George Hotel in New York, which is home to 208 formerly homeless people and 208 low-income tenants, the average length of tenancy is close to seven years. (All residents pay 30 percent of their income for rent； for the formerly homeless, this comes out of their government benefits.) When people move on, it is usually because they’ve found a preferable apartment.
[M] “Tenants also want to participate in shaping the public areas of the buildings，” said Haggerty. “They formed a gardening committee. They want a terrace on the roof. Those are things I didn’t count on.’’ The most common tenant demand? People always want more storage space—but that’s true of every New Yorker,” she adds. “In many ways, we’re a lot like a normal apartment building. Our tenants look like anyone else. ”
[N] As I mentioned, homelessness is a catch-all for a variety of problems. A number of readers asked whether the campaign will address family homelessness, which has different causes and requires a different solution. I’ve been following some of the promising ideas emerging to address and prevent family homelessness. Later in 2011, I’ll explore these ideas in a column. For now, I’ll conclude with an update on the 100 000 Homes Campaign. Since Tuesday, New Orleans and a few other communities have reported new results. The current count of people housed is 7 043.
	46.Tenants in Common Ground’s residences all want more room for storage.
	47.Homes Campaign provides first-hand proof that the homeless are not what they were once believed to be.
	48.Common Ground’s residences are well-managed and by and large peaceful.
	49.Housing the homeless is only the first step to solving all their problems.
	50.A large percent of the chronically homeless have suffered from brain injury.
	51.After being housed many homeless people become confused at first as to how to deal with life off the street.
	52.Some people think the best way to help the homeless is to provide them with communal housing.
	53.The homeless with health problems should be given regular support in their daily lives.
	54.Until recently American society has failed to see what homelessness is all about.
	55.Many formerly homeless tenants in New York’s Common Ground’s residences got hired.
Section C
Directions ： There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A).B.)C) and D) . You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　　Technology can make us smarter or stupider, and we need to develop a set of principles to guide our everyday behavior and make sure that tech is improving and not hindering our mental processes. One of the big questions being debated today is: What kind of information do we need to have stored in our heads, and what kind can we leave “in the cloud，” to be accessed as necessary?
　　　An increasingly powerful group within education are championing “digital literacy”. In their view, skills beat knowledge, developing “digital literacy” is more important than learning mere content, and all facts are now Google-able and therefore unworthy of committing to memory. But even the most sophisticated digital literacy skills won’t help students and workers navigate the world if they don’t have a broad base of knowledge about how the world actually operates. If you focus on the delivery mechanism and not the content, you’re doing kids a disservice.
　　　Indeed, evidence from cognitive science challenges the notion that skills can exist independent of factual knowledge. Data from the last thirty years leads to a conclusion that is not scientifically challengeable： thinking well requires knowing facts, and that’s true not only because you need something to think about. The very processes that teachers care about most —critical thinking processes—are intimately	intertwined(交织）with factual knowledge that is stored in long-term memory.
　　　In other words, just because you can Google the date of Black Tuesday doesn’t mean you understand why the Great Depression happened or how it compares to our recent economic slump. There is no doubt that the students of today, and the workers of tomorrow, will need to innovate, collaborate and evaluate. But such skills can’t be separated from the knowledge that gives rise to them. To innovate, you have to know what came before. To collaborate, you have to contribute knowledge to the joint venture. And to evaluate, you have to compare new information against knowledge you’ve already mastered.
　　　So here’s a principle for thinking in a digital world, in two parts. First, acquire a base of factual knowledge in any domain in which you want to perform well. This base supplies the essential foundation for building skills, and it can’t be outsourced (外包）to a search engine.
　　Second, take advantage of computers’ invariable memory, but also the brain’s elaborative memory. Computers are great when you want to store information that shouldn’t change. But brains are the superior choice when you want information to change, in interesting and useful ways： to connect up with other facts and ideas, to acquire successive layers of meaning, to steep for a while in your accumulated knowledge and experience and so produce a richer mental brew.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　America’s recent history has been a persistent tilt to the West—of people, ideas, commerce and even political power. California and Texas are the twin poles of the West, but very different ones. For most of the 20th century the home of Silicon Valley and Hollywood has been the brainier and trendier of the two. Texas has trailed behind： its stereotype has been a conservative Christian in cowboy boots. But twins can change places. Is that happening now?
　　It is easy to find evidence that California is in a panic. At the start of this month the once golden state started paying creditors in IOUs (欠条).The gap between projected outgoings and income for the current fiscal (财政的）year has leapt to a horrible $26 billion. With no sign of a new budget to close this gulf, one credit agency has already downgraded California’s debt. As budgets are cut, universities will let in fewer students, prisoners will be released early and schemes to protect the vulnerable will be rolled back.
　　By contrast, Texas has coped well with the recession, with an unemployment rate two points below the national average and one of the lowest rates of housing repossession. In part this is because Texan banks, hard hit in the last property bust, did not overexpand this time. Texas also clearly offers a different model, based on small government. It has no state capital-gains or income tax, and a business- friendly and immigrant-tolerant attitude. It is home to more Fortune 500 companies than any other state.
　　Despite all this, it still seems too early to hand over America’s future to Texas. To begin with, that lean Texan model has its own problems. It has not invested enough in education, and many experts rightly worry about a “lost generation” of mostly Hispanic Texans with insufficient skills for the demands of the knowledge economy.
　　Second, it has never paid to bet against a state with as many inventive people as California. Even if Hollywood has gone into depression, it still boasts an unequalled array of sunrise industries and the most brisk venture-capital industry on the planet. The state also has an awesome ability to reinvent itself —as it did when its defence industry collapsed at the end of the cold war.
　　The truth is that both states could learn from each other. Texas still lacks California’s great universities and lags in terms of culture. California could adopt not just Texas’s leaner state, but also its more bipartisan (两党的）approach to politics. There is no perfect model of government: it is America’s genius to have 50 public-policy laboratories competing to find out what works best.

　　　Nursing, as a typically female profession, must deal constantly with the false impression that nurses are there to wait on the physician. As nurses, we are    26    to provide nursing care only. We do not have any legal or moral    27    any physician. We provide health teaching, assess physical as well as emotional problems,   28	patient-related services, and make all of our nursing decisions based upon what is best or suitable for the patient. If, in any circumstance, we feel that a physician’s order is inappropriate or unsafe, we have a legal   29   to question that order or refuse to carry it out.
　　　Nursing is not a nine-to-five job with every weekend off. All nurses are aware of that before they enter the profession. The emotional and   30   stress, however, that occurs due to odd working hours is a   31   reason for a lot of the career dissatisfaction. It is sometimes required that we work overtime, and that we change shifts four or five times a month. That disturbs our personal lives,   32   our sleeping and eating habits, and isolates us from everything except job-related friends and activities.
　　　The quality of nursing care is   33   dramatically by these situations. Most hospitals are now staffed by new graduates, as experienced nurses finally give up trying to change the system. Consumers of   34   related services have evidently not been affected enough yet to demand changes   35  . But if trends continue as predicted, they will find that most critical hospital care will be provided by new, inexperienced, and sometimes inadequately trained nurses.
PartⅢ	Reading Comprehension	(40 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　Millions of Americans are entering their 60s and are more concerned than ever about retirement. They know they need to save, but how much? And what exactly are they saving for—to spend more time   36   the grandkids, go traveling, or start another career? It turns out that husbands and wives may have   37	different ideas about the subject.
　　　The deepest divide is in the way spouses envisage their lifestyle in their later years. Fidelity Investments Inc. found 41 percent of the 500 couples it surveyed   38   on whether both or at least one spouse will work in retirement. Wives are generally right regarding their husbands’ retirement age, but men   39	  the age their wives will be when they stop working. And husbands are slightly more  40   about their standard of living than wives are.
　　Busy juggling (穷于应付)careers and families, most couples don’t take the time to sit down,   41   or together, and think about what they would like to do 5, 10 or 20 years from now. They   42    they are on the same page, but the    43   is they have avoided even talking about it.
　　　If you are self-employed or in a job that doesn’t have a standard retirement age, you may be more apt to delay thinking about these issues, It is often a   44   retirement date that provides the catalyst (催化剂）to start planning. Getting laid off or accepting an early-retirement    45   can force your hand. But don’t wait until you get a severance (遣散费）check to begin planning.
A) assume	F) illustrating	K) radically
B) confidential	G) mysteriously	L) reality
C) disagree	H) observe	M) separately
D) formula	I) optimistic	N) spoiling
E) forthcoming	J) package	O) underestimate
Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
What If Middle-Class Jobs Disappear?
[A] The most recent recession in the United States began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. However, two years after the official end of the recession, few Americans would say that economic troubles are behind us. The unemployment rate, in particular, remains above 9%. Some labor market indicators, such as the proportion of long-term unemployed, are worse now than for any postwar recession.
[B] There are two widely circulated narratives to explain what’s going on. The Keynesian narrative is that there has been a major drop in aggregate demand. According to this narrative, the slump can be largely cured by using monetary and fiscal (财政的）stimulus. The main anti-Keynesian narrative is that businesses are suffering from uncertainty and over-regulation. According to this narrative, the slump can be cured by having the government commit to and follow a more hands-off approach.
[C] I want to suggest a third interpretation. Without ruling out a role for aggregate demand or for the regulatory environment, I wish to suggest that structural change is an important factor in the current rate of high unemployment. The economy is in a state of transition, in which the middle-class jobs that emerged after World WarⅡ have begun to decline. As Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee put it in a recent e-book Race Against the Machine : “The root of our problems is not that we’re in a great recession, or a great stagnation (停滞）,but rather that we are in the early throes(阵痛）of a great restructuring. ’’
[D] In fact, I believe the Great Depression of the 1930s can also be interpreted in part as an economic transition. The impact of the internal combustion engine (内燃机）and the small electric motor on farming and manufacturing reduced the value of uneducated laborers. Instead, by the 1950s, a middle class of largely clerical (从事文秘考必工作的）workers was the most significant part of the labor force. Between 1930 and 1950, the United States economy underwent a great transition. Demand fell for human effort such as lifting, squeezing, and hammering. Demand increased for workers who could read and follow directions. The evolutionary process eventually changed us from a nation of laborers to a nation of clerks.
[E] The proportion of employment classified as “clerical workers” grew from 5.2% in 1910 to a peak of 19.3% in 1980. (However, by 2000 this proportion had edged down to 17. 4%.) Overall, workers classified as clerical workers, technical workers, managers and officials exceeded 50% of the labor force by 2000. Corresponding declines took place in the manual occupations. Workers classified as laborers, other than farm hands or miners, peaked at 11. 4% of the labor force in 1920 but were barely 6% by 1950 and less than 4% by 2000. Farmers and farm laborers fell from 33% of the labor force in 1910 to less than 15% by 1950 and only 1.2% in 2000.
[F] The introduction of the tractor and improvements in the factory rapidly reduced the demand for uneducated workers. By the 1930s, a marginal farm hand could not produce enough to justify his employment. Sharecropping, never much better than a subsistence occupation, was no longer viable （可行的）。 Meanwhile, machines were replacing manufacturing occupations like cigar rolling and glass blowing for light bulbs.
[G] The structural-transition interpretation of the unemployment problem of the 1930s would be that the demand for uneducated workers in the United States had fallen, but the supply remained high. The high school graduation rate was only 8.8% in 1912 and still just 29% in 1931. By 1950, it had reached 59%. With a new generation of workers who had completed high school, the mismatch between skills and jobs had been greatly reduced.
[H] What took place after World WarⅡ was not the revival of a 1920s economy, with its small farming units, urban manufacturing, and plurality of laborers. Instead, the 1950s saw the creation of a new suburban economy, with a plurality of white-collar workers. With an expanded transportation and communications infrastructure(基础设施)，businesses needed telephone operators, shipping clerks and similar occupations. If you could read, follow simple instructions, and settle into a routine, you could find a job in the post-war economy.
[I] The trend away from manual labor has continued. Even within the manufacturing sector, the share of production and non-supervisory workers in manufacturing employment went from, over 85% just after World WarⅡ to less than 70% in more recent years. To put this another way, the proportion of white- collar work in manufacturing has doubled over the past 50 years. On the factory floor itself, work has become less physically demanding. Instead, it requires more cognitive skills and the ability to understand and carry out well-defined procedures.
[J] As noted earlier, the proportion of clerical workers in the economy peaked in 1980. By that date, computers and advanced communications equipment had already begun to affect telephone operations and banking. The rise of the personal computer and the Internet has widened the impact of these technologies to include nearly every business and industry.
[K] The economy today differs from that of a generation ago. Mortgage and consumer loan underwriters (风 险评估人）have been replaced by credit scoring. Record stores have been replaced by music downloads. Book stores are closing, while sales of books on electronic readers have increased. Data entry has been moved off shore. Routine customer support also has been outsourced (外包）overseas.
[L] These trends serve to limit the availability of well-defined jobs. If a job can be characterized by a precise set of instructions, then that job is a candidate to be automated or outsourced to modestly educated workers in developing countries. The result is what David Autor calls the polarization of the American job market.
[M] Using the latest Census Bureau data, Matthew Slaughter found that from 2000 to 2010 the real earnings of college graduates (with no advanced degree) fell by more in percentage terms than the earnings of high school graduates. In fact, over this period the only education category to show an increase in earnings was those with advanced degrees.
[N] The outlook for mid-skill jobs would not appear to be bright. Communications technology and computer intelligence continue to improve, putting more occupations at risk. For example, many people earn a living as drivers, including trucks and taxicabs. However, the age of driverless vehicles appears to be moving closer. Another example is in the field of education. In the fall of 2011, an experiment with an online course in artificial intelligence conducted by two Stanford professors drew tens of thousands of registrants（报名者）。 This increases the student-teacher ratio by a factor of close to a thousand. Imagine the number of teaching jobs that might be eliminated if this could be done for math, economics, chemistry, and so on.
[O] It’s important to bear in mind that when we offer a structural interpretation of unemployment，a “loss of jobs” means an increase in productivity. Traditionally, economists have argued that productivity increases are a good thing, even though they may cause unemployment for some workers in the short run. In the long run, the economy does not run out of jobs. Rather, new jobs emerge as old jobs disappear. The story we tell is that average well-being rises, and the more people are able to adapt, the more widespread the improvement becomes.
	46.Even factory floor work today has become intellectually challenging rather than physically demanding.
	47.Increases in productivity prove beneficial though some people may lose their jobs temporarily.
	48.The unemployment rate remained high even two years after the government declared the recent recession was over.
	49.The author suggests that the recent high unemployment rate is mainly caused by a decrease of middle- class jobs.
　　	50.The creation of a suburban economy in the 1950s created lots of office jobs.
	51.In the first decade of the 21st century, only people with postgraduate degrees experienced an increase in earnings.
	52.One economics theory suggests using monetary and fiscal stimulus to cope with an economic recession.
	53.The popularity of online courses may eliminate many teaching jobs.
	54.Computer technology has brought about revolutionary changes in the record and book business.
	55.White-collar workers accounted for more than half of the labor force by the end of the 20th century.
Section C
Directions ： There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.• For each of them there are four choices marked A)，B)，C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage. 
　　“Deep reading” —as opposed to the often superficial reading we do on the Web —is an endangered practice, one we ought to take steps to preserve as we would a historic building or a significant work of art. Its disappearance would jeopardize the intellectual and emotional development of generations growing up online, as well as the preservation of a critical part of our culture:  the novels, poems and other kinds of literature that can be appreciated only by readers whose brains, quite literally,  have been trained to understand them.
　　Recent research in cognitive science and psychology has demonstrated that deep reading —slow, immersive, rich in sensory detail and emotional and moral complexity—is a distinctive experience, different in kind from the mere decoding of words. Although deep reading does not, strictly speaking, require a conventional book, the built-in limits of the printed page are uniquely helpful to the deep reading experience. A book’s lack of hyperlinks(超链接）, for example, frees the reader from making decisions—Should I click on this link or not? —allowing her to remain fully immersed in the narrative.
　　That immersion is supported by the way the brain handles language rich in detail, indirect reference and figures of speech: by creating a mental representation that draws on the same brain regions that would be active if the scene were unfolding in real life. The emotional situations and moral dilemmas that are the stuff of literature are also vigorous exercise for the brain? propelling us inside the heads of fictional characters and even, studies suggest, increasing our real-life capacity for empathy (认同）。 
　　None of this is likely to happen when we’re browsing through a website. Although we call the activity by the same name, the deep reading of books and the information-driven reading we do on the Web are very different, both in the experience they produce and in the capacities they develop. A growing body of evidence suggests that online reading may be less engaging and less satisfying, even for the “digital natives” to whom it is so familiar. Last month, for example,  Britain’s National Literacy Trust released the results of a study of 34 910 young people aged 8 to 16. Researchers reported that 39% of children and teens read daily using electronic devices, but only 28% read printed materials every day. Those who read only onscreen were three times less likely to say they enjoy reading very much and a third less likely to have a favorite book. The study also found that young people who read daily only onscreen were nearly two times less likely to be above-average readers than those who read daily in print or both in print and onscreen. 
	56.What does the author say about “deep reading”?
	A) It serves as a complement to online reading.
	B) It should be preserved before it is too late.
	C) It is mainly suitable for reading literature.
	D) It is an indispensable part of education.
	57.Why does the author advocate the reading of literature?
	A) It helps promote readers’ intellectual and emotional growth.
	B) It enables readers to appreciate the complexity of language.
	C) It helps readers build up immersive reading habits.
	D) It is quickly becoming an endangered practice.
	58.In what way does printed-page reading differ from online reading?
	A) It ensures the reader’s cognitive growth.
	B) It enables the reader to be fully engaged.
	C) It activates a different region of the brain.
	D) It helps the reader learn rhetorical devices.
	59.What do the studies show about online reading?
	A) It gradually impairs one’s eyesight.
	B) It keeps arousing readers’ curiosity.
	C) It provides up-to-date information.
	D) It renders reading less enjoyable.
	60.What do we learn from the study released by Britain’s National Literacy Trust?
	A) Onscreen readers may be less competent readers.
	B) Those who do reading in print are less informed.
	C) Young people find reading onscreen more enjoyable.
	D) It is now easier to find a favorite book online to read.
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　　Many current discussions of immigration issues talk about immigrants in general, as if they were abstract people in an abstract world. But the concrete differences between immigrants from different countries affect whether their coming here is good or bad for the American people.
　　　The very thought of formulating- immigration laws from the standpoint of what is best for the American people seems to have been forgotten by many who focus on how to solve the problems of illegal immigration .
　　　It is hard to look for “ the ideal outcome” on immigration in the abstract. Economics professor Milton Friedman once said, “The best is the enemy of the good,”   which to me meant that attempts to achieve an unattainable ideal can prevent us from reaching good outcomes that are possible in practice.
　　　Too much of our current immigration controversy is conducted in terms of abstract ideals, such as “We are a nation of immigrants.”  Of course we are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of people who wear shoes. Does it follow that we should admit anybody who wears shoes?
　　　The immigrants of today are very different from those who arrived here a hundred years ago. Moreover, the society in which they arrive is different. To me, it is better to build a wall around the welfare state than the country.
　　　But the welfare state is already here —and, far from having a wall built around it, the welfare state is expanding in all directions. We do not have a choice between the welfare state and open borders. Anything we try to do as regards immigration laws has to be done in the context of a huge welfare state that is already a major, inescapable fact of life.
　　　Among other facts of life utterly ignored by many advocates of de facto amnesty(事实上的大救）is that the free international movement of people is different from free international trade in goods.
　　　Buying cars or cameras from other countries is not the same as admitting people from those countries or any other countries. Unlike inanimate objects, people have cultures and not all cultures are compatible with the culture in this country that has produced such benefits for the American people for so long.
　　Not only the United States, but the Western world in general, has been discovering the hard way that admitting people with incompatible cultures is an irreversible decision with incalculable consequences. If we do not see that after recent terrorist attacks on the streets of Boston and London, when will we see it?
　　“Comprehensive immigration reform” means doing everything all together in a rush, without time to look before we leap, and basing ourselves on abstract notions about abstract people.
	61.What does the author say about immigrants in America?
	A) They all hope to gain citizenship and enjoy the welfare.
	B) They come to America with different dreams and purposes.
	C) Their background may determine whether they benefit the American people.
	D) Their cultures affect the extent to which they will achieve success in America.
	62.What does the author try to say by citing Milton Friedman’s remark?
	A) It is hardly practical to find an ideal solution to America’s immigration problem.
	B) Ideal outcomes could be produced only by comprehensive immigration reform.
	C) As for immigration, good results cannot be achieved without good intentions.
	D) The proper solution of immigration issues is an ideal of the American public.
	63.What is the author’s view regarding America’s immigration policy?
	A) America should open its borders to immigrants from different countries.
	B) Immigrants have contributed greatly to the welfare of American people.
	C) Unrestricted immigration will undermine the American welfare state.
	D) There is no point building a wall around the American welfare state.
	64.What is the author’s purpose in citing the recent terrorist attacks on the streets of Boston and London?
	A) To show that America should join hands with Europe in fighting terrorists.
	B) To prove that it is high time America made comprehensive immigration reforms.
	C) To prove that terrorism is the most dangerous threat to America and the world in general.
	D) To show that immigrants’ cultural incompatibility with the host country has consequences.
	65.What is the author’s attitude towards “comprehensive immigration reform”?
　　　A) Supportive.	C) Wait-and-see.
　　　B) Negative.	D) Indifferent.

　　Tests may be the most unpopular part of academic life. Students hate them because they produce fear and    26    about being evaluated, and a focus on grades instead of learning for learning’s sake.
　　But tests are also valuable. A well-constructed test    27    what you know and what you still need to learn. Tests help you see how your performance    28    that of others. And knowing that you’ll be tested on    29     material is certainly likely to    30 you to learn the material more thoroughly.
　　However, there’s another reason you might dislike tests: You may assume that tests have the power to    31    your worth as a person. If you do badly on a test, you may be tempted to believe that you’ve received some    32    information about yourself from the professor, information that says you’re a failure in some significant way.
　　This is a dangerous—and wrong-headed —assumption. If you do badly on a test, it doesn’t mean you’re a bad person or stupid. Or that you’ll  never do better again, and that your life is     33     If you don’t do well on a test, you’re the same person you were before you took the test—no better, no worse. You just did badly on a test. That’s it.
　　　34     , tests are not a measure of your value as an individual—they are a measure only of how well and how much you studied. Tests are tools;  they are indirect and    35    measures of what we know.

　　For investors who desire low risk and guaranteed income, US government bonds are a secure investment because these bonds have the financial backing and full faith and credit of the federal government. Municipal bonds, also secure, are offered by local governments and often have    36    such as tax-free interest. Some may even be    37    Corporate bonds are a bit more risky.
　　Two questions often     38      first-time corporate bond investors. The first is “If I purchase a corporate bond, do I have to hold it until the maturity date?,”  The answer is no. Bonds are bought and sold daily on    39    securities exchanges. However, if you decide to sell your bond before its maturity date, you’re not guaranteed to get the face value of the bond. For example, if your bond does not have    40    that make it attractive to other investors, you may be forced to sell your bond at a     41  ,i.e., a price less than the bond’s face value. But if your bond is highly valued by other investors, you may be able to sell it at a premium, i.e., a price above its face value. Bond prices generally    42    inversely(相反地)with current market interest rates. As interest rates go up, bond prices fall, and versa（反之亦然）. Thus, like all investments, bonds have a degree of risk.
　　　The second question is “ How can I    43    the investment risk of a particular bond issue? ”Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service rate the level of risk of many corporate and government bonds. And     44	  , the higher the market risk of a bond, the higher the interest rate. Investors will invest in a bond considered risky only if the     45     return is high enough.

Section B
Directions： In this section^ you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Lessons From a Feminist Paradise
[A] On the surface, Sweden appears to be a feminist paradise. Look at any global survey of gender equality and Sweden will be near the top. Family-friendly policies are its norm—with 16 months of paid parental leave, special protections for part-time workers, and state-subsidized preschools where, according to a government website, “gender-awareness education is increasingly common.” Due to an unofficial quota system, women hold 45 percent of positions in the Swedish parliament. They have enjoyed the protection of government agencies with titles like the Ministry of Integration and Gender Equality and the Secretariat of Gender Research. So why are American women so far ahead of their Swedish counterparts in breaking through the glass ceiling?
[B] In a 2012 report, the World Economic Forum found that when it comes to closing the gender gap in “economic participation and opportunity,” the United States is ahead of not only Sweden but also Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Iceland, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Sweden’s rank in the report can largely be explained by its political quota system. Though the United States has fewer women in the workforce (68 percent compared to Sweden’s 77 percent), American women who choose to be employed are far more likely to work full-time and to hold high-level jobs as managers or professionals. They also own more businesses, launch more start-ups(新创办的企业）, and more often work in traditionally male fields. As for breaking through the glass ceiling in business, American women are well in the lead.
[C] What explains the American advantage? How can it be that societies like Sweden, where gender equality is vigorously pursued and enforced, have fewer female managers, executives, professionals, and business owners than the laissez-faire(自由放任的）United States? A new study by Cornell economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn gives an explanation.
[D] Generous parental leave policies and readily available part-time options have unintended consequences: instead of strengthening women’s attachment to the workplace, they appear to weaken it. In addition to a 16-month leave, a Swedish parent has the right to work six hours a day (for a reduced salary) until his or her child is eight years old. Mothers are far more likely than fathers to take advantage of this law. But extended leaves and part-time employment are known to be harmful to careers——for both genders. And with women a second factor comes into play: most seem to enjoy the flexible-time arrangement (once known as the “mommy track”) and never find their way back to full-time or high-level employment. In sum; generous family-friendly policies do keep more women in the labor market, but they also tend to diminish their careers.
[E] According to Blau and Kahn, Swedish-style paternal (父亲的）leave policies and flexible-time arrangements pose a second threat to women’s progress:  they make employers cautious about hiring women for full-time positions at all. Offering a job to a man is the safer bet. He is far less likely to take a year of parental leave and then return on a reduced work schedule for the next eight years.
[F] I became aware of the trials of career-focused European women a few years ago when I met a postdoctoral student from Germany who was then a visiting fellow at Johns Hopkins. She was astonished by the professional possibilities afforded to young American women. Her best hope in Germany was a government job—prospects for women in the private sector were dim. “In Germany，” she told me, “we have all the benefits, but employers don’t want to hire us.
[G] Swedish economists Magnus Henrekson and Mikael Stenkula addressed the following question in their 2009 study: why are there so few female top executives in the European	egalitarian(平等主义的）welfare states? Their answer : “Broad-based welfare-state policies hinder women’s representation in elite competitive positions.”
[H] It is tempting to declare the Swedish policies regressive (退步的）and hail the American system as superior. But that would be shortsighted. The Swedes can certainly take a lesson from the United States and look for ways to clear a path for their ambitious female careerists. But most women are not committed careerists. When the Pew Research Center recently asked  American parents to identify their “ideal” life arrangement, 47 percent of mothers said they would prefer to work part-time and 20 percent said they would prefer not to work at all. Fathers answered differently： 75 percent preferred full-time work. Some version of the Swedish system might work well for a majority of American parents, but the United States is unlikely to fully embrace the Swedish model. Still, we can learn from their experience.
[I] Despite its failure to shatter the glass ceiling, Sweden has one of the most powerful and innovative economies in the world. In its 2011-2012 survey, the World Economic Forum ranked Sweden as the world’s third most competitive economy;  the United States came in fifth. Sweden, dubbed the “rockstar of the recovery ” in the Washington Post.  also leads the world in life satisfaction and happiness. It is a society well worth studying, and its efforts to conquer the gender gap impart a vital lesson—though not the lesson the Swedes had in mind.
[J] Sweden has gone farther than any other nation on earth to integrate the sexes and to offer women the same opportunities and freedoms as men. For decades, these descendants of the Vikings have been trying to show the world that the right mix of enlightened policy, consciousness raising,  and non-sexist child rearing would close the gender divide once and for all. Yet the divide persists.
[K] A 2012 press release from Statistics Sweden bears the title “Gender Equality in Sweden Treading (踩) Water” and notes:
·The total income from employment for all ages is lower for women than for men.
·One in three employed women and one in ten employed men work part-time.
·Women’s working time is influenced by the number and age of their children, but men’s working time is not affected by these factors.
·Of all employees, only 13 percent of the women and 12 percent of the men have occupations with an even distribution of the sexes.
[L] Confronted with such facts, some Swedish activists and legislators are demanding more extreme and far- reaching measures, such as replacing male and female pronouns with a neutral alternative and monitoring children more closely to correct them when they gravitate (被吸引) toward gendered play. When it came to light last year that mothers, far more than fathers, chose to stay home from work to care for their sick kids, Ulf Kristersson,  minister of social security, quickly commissioned a study to determine the causes of and possible cures for this disturbing state of affairs.
[M] Swedish family policies, by accommodating women’s preferences effectively, are reducing the number of women in elite competitive positions. The Swedes will find this paradoxical and try to find solutions. Let us hope these do not include banning gender pronouns, policing children’s play, implementing more gender quotas, or treating women5s special attachment to home and family as a social injustice. Most mothers do not aspire to (向往）elite, competitive full-time positions: the Swedish policies have given them the freedom and opportunity to live the lives they prefer. Americans should look past the gender rhetoric and consider what these Scandinavians have achieved. On their way to creating a feminist paradise, the Swedes have unintentionally created a haven (避风港）for normal mortals.

Section C
Directions ： There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　　Texting has long been bemoaned (哀叹）as the downfall of the written word, “penmanship for illiterates,” as one critic called it. To which the proper response is LOL. Texting properly isn’t writing at all. It’s a “spoken” language that is getting richer and more complex by the year.
　　　First, some historical perspective. Writing was only invented 5 500 years ago, whereas language probably traces back at least 80 000 years. Thus talking came first; writing is just a craft that came along later. As such, the first writing was based on the way people talk, with short sentences. However, while talking is largely subconscious and rapid, writing is deliberate and slow. Over time, writers took advantage of this and started crafting long-winded sentences such as this one: “The whole engagement lasted above 12 hours, till the gradual retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example was given by the principal leaders and...”
　　　No one talks like that casually—or should. But it is natural to desire to do so for special occasions. In the old days, we didn’t much write like talking because there was no mechanism to reproduce the speed of conversation. But texting and instant messaging do—and a revolution has begun. It involves the crude mechanics of writing, but in its economy, spontaneity and even vulgarity, texting is actually a new kind of talking, with its own kind of grammar and conventions.
　　　Take LOL. It doesn’t actually mean “laughing out loud” in a literal sense anymore. LOL has evolved into something much subtler and sophisticated and is used even when nothing is remotely amusing. Jocelyn texts “Where have you been?” and Annabelle texts back “LOL at the library studying for two hours. ” LOL signals basic empathy(同感）between texters, easing tension and creating a sense of equality. Instead of having a literal meaning, it does something —conveying an attitude—just like the ending conveys past tense rather than “meaning” anything. LOL, of all things, is grammar.
　　Of course no one thinks about that consciously. But then most of communication operates without being noticed. Over time, the meaning of a word or an expression drifts —meat used to mean any kind of food, silly used to mean, believe it or not, blessed.
　　Civilization, then, is fine—people banging away on their smartphones are fluently using a code separate from the one they use in actual writing, and there is no evidence that texting is ruining composition skills. Worldwide people speak differently from the way they write, and texting—quick, casual and only intended to be read once—is actually a way of talking with your fingers.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　It’s possible to admire Oprah Winfrey and still wish Harvard hadn’t awarded her an honorary doctor of law degree and the commencement(毕业典礼)speaker spot at yesterday’s graduation. There’s no question Oprah’s achievements place her in the temple of American success stories. Talent, charm, and an exceptional work ethic have rarely hurled anyone as far as they have this former abused teenage mother from rural Mississippi who became one of the worlds most successful entertainment icons and the first African-American female billionaire.
　　Honorary degrees are often conferred on non-academic leaders in the arts, business, and politics. Harvard’s list in recent years has included Kofi Annan, Bill Gates, Meryl Streep, and David Souter. But Oprah’s particular brand of celebrity is not a good fit for the values of a university whose motto (座右铭）, Veritas, means truth. Oprah’s passionate advocacy extends, unfortunately, to a hearty embrace of fake science. Most notoriously, Oprah’s validation of Jenny McCarthy’s claim that vaccines cause autism (自闭症) has no doubt contributed to much harm through the foolish avoidance of vaccines.
　　Famous people are entitled to a few failings, like the rest of us, and the choice of commencement speakers often reflects a balance of institutional priorities and aspirations. Judging from our conversations with many students, Oprah was a widely popular choice.
　　But this vote of confidence in Oprah sends a troubling message at precisely the time when American universities need to do more to advance the cause of reason. As former Dean of Harvard College, Harry Lewis，noted in a blog post about his objections, “It seems very odd for Harvard to honor such a high profile popularizer of the irrational... at a time when political and religious nonsense so jeopardize the rule of reason in this allegedly enlightened democracy and around the world.
　　As America’s oldest and most visible university, Harvard has a special opportunity to convey its respect for science not only through its research and teaching programs but also in its public affirmation of evidence-based inquiry.
　　Unfortunately, many American universities seem awfully busy protecting their brand name and not nearly busy enough protecting the pursuit of knowledge. A recent article in The Harvard Crimson noted the shocking growth of Harvard’s public relations arm in the last five years and it questioned whether a focus on risk management and avoiding controversy was really the best outward-looking face of this great institution.
　　As American research universities begin to resemble profit centers and entertainment complexes, it’s easy to lose sight of their primary mission: to produce and spread knowledge. This mission depends on traditions of rational discourse and vigorous defense of the scientific method. Oprah Winfrey’s honorary doctorate was a step in the wrong direction.

　　　Intolerance is the art of ignoring any views that differ from your own. It    26    itself in hatred, stereotypes, prejudice, and 27    Once it intensifies in people, intolerance is nearly impossible to overcome. But why would anyone want to be labeled intolerant? Why would people want to be    28    about the world around them? Why would one want to be part of the problem in America, instead of the solution?
　　　There are many explanations for intolerant attitudes, some    29    childhood. It is likely that intolerant folks grew up   30   intolerant parents and the cycle of prejudice has simply continued for   31	. Perhaps intolerant people are so set in their ways that they find it easier to ignore anything that might not   32   their limited view of life. Or maybe intolerant students have simply never been    33    to anyone different from themselves. But none of these reasons is an excuse for allowing the intolerance to continue.
　　　Intolerance should not be confused with disagreement. It is, of course, possible to disagree with an opinion without being intolerant of it/If you understand a belief but still don’t believe in that specific belief, that’s fine. You are    34    your opinion. As a matter of fact,    35    dissenters(持异议者) are important for any belief. If we all believed the same things, we would never grow? and we would never learn about the world around us. Intolerance does not stem from disagreement. It stems from fear. And fear stems from ignorance.

Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　His future subjects have not always treated the Prince of Wales with the respect one might expect. They laughed aloud in 1986 when the heir to the British    36    told a TV reporter that he talked to his plants at his country house, Highgrove, to stimulate their growth. The Prince was being humorous —“My sense of humor will get me into trouble one day,“ he said to his aids（随从）—but listening to Charles Windsor can indeed prove stimulating. The royal    37    has been promoting radical ideas for most of his adult life. Some of his    38   ，which once sounded a bit weird, were simply ahead of their time. Now, finally, the world seems to be catching up with him.
　　　Take his views on farming. Prince Charles’ Duchy Home Farm went   39   back in 1986, when most shoppers cared only about the low price tag on suspiciously blemish-free(无瑕戚的）vegetables and    40    large chickens piled high in supermarkets.
　　　His warnings on climate change proved farsighted, too. Charles began    41    action on global warming in 1990 and says he has been worried about the    42    of man on the environment since he was a teenager.
　　　Although he has gradually gained international    43    as one of the world’s leading conservationists, many British people still think of him as an    44    person who talks to plants. This year, as it happens, South Korean scientists proved that plants really do    45    to sound. So Charles was ahead of the game there, too.

High School Sports Aren’t Killing Academics
[A] In this months Atlantic cover article, “The Case Against High-School Sports,” Amanda Ripley argues that school-sponsored sports programs should be seriously cut. She writes that, unlike most countries that outperform the United States on international assessments, American schools put too much of an emphasis on athletics. “Sports are embedded in American schools in a way they are not almost anywhere else，” she writes. “Yet this difference hardly ever comes up in domestic debates about America’s international mediocrity (平庸) in education.”
[B] American student-athletes reap many benefits from participating in sports, but the costs to the schools could outweigh their benefits, she argues. In particular, Ripley contends that sports crowd out the academic missions of schools： America should learn from South Korea and Finland and every other country at the top level of international test scores, all of whom emphasize athletics far less in school. “Even in eighth grade, American kids spend more than twice the time Korean kids spend playing sports，” she writes, citing a 2010 study published in the Journal of Advanced Academics.
[C] It might well be true that sports are far more rooted in American high schools than in other countries. But our reading of international test scores finds no support for the argument against school athletics. Indeed, our own research and that of others lead us to make the opposite case. School-sponsored sports appear to provide benefits that seem to increase, not detract (减少)from, academic success.
[D] Ripley indulges a popular obsession (痴迷) with international test score comparisons,which show wide and frightening gaps between the United States and other countries. She ignores, however, the fact that states vary at least as much in test scores as do developed countries. A 2011 report from Harvard University shows that Massachusetts produces math scores comparable to South Korea and Finland, while Mississippi scores are closer to Trinidad and Tobago. Ripley’s thesis about sports falls apart in light of this fact. Schools in Massachusetts provide sports programs while schools in Finland do not. Schools in Mississippi may love football while in Tobago interscholastic sports are nowhere near as prominent. Sports cannot explain these similarities in performance. They can’t explain international differences either.
[E] If it is true that sports undermine the academic mission of American schools, we would expect to see a negative relationship between the commitment to athletics and academic achievement. However, the University of Arkansas’s Daniel Bowen and Jay Greene actually find the opposite. They examine this relationship by analyzing schools’ sports winning percentages as well as student-athletic participation rates compared to graduation rates and standardized test score achievement over a five-year period for all public high schools in Ohio. Controlling for student poverty levels, demographics(人口统计4大况）， and district financial resources, both measures of a school’s commitment to athletics are significantly and positively related to lower dropout rates as well as higher test scores.
[F] On-the-field success and high participation in sports is not random —it requires focus and dedication to athletics. One might think this would lead schools obsessed with winning to deemphasize academics. Bowen and Greene’s results contradict that argument. A likely explanation for this seemingly counterintuitive (与直觉相反的）result is that success in sports programs actually facilitates or rejects greater social capital within a school’s community.
[G] Ripley cites the writings of renowned sociologist James Coleman, whose research in education was groundbreaking. Coleman in his early work held athletics in contempt, arguing that they crowded out schools’ academic missions. Ripley quotes his 1961 study, The Adolescent Society, where Coleman writes, “Altogether, the trophy（奖品）case would suggest to the innocent visitor that he was entering an athletic club, not an educational institution.
[H] However, in later research Coleman would show how the success of schools is highly dependent on what he termed social capital, “the norms, the social networks, and the relationships between adults and children that are of value for the child’s growing up. ”
[I] According to a 2013 evaluation conducted by the Crime Lab at the University of Chicago, a program called Becoming a Mari—Sports Edition creates lasting improvements in the boys’ study habits and grade point averages. During the first year of the program, students were found to be less likely to transfer schools or be engaged in violent crime. A year after the program, participants were less likely to have had an encounter with the juvenile justice system.
[J] If school-sponsored sports were completely eliminated tomorrow, many American students would still have opportunities to participate in organized athletics elsewhere, much like they do in countries such as Finland, Germany, and South Korea. The same is not certain when it comes to students from more disadvantaged backgrounds. In an overview of the research on non-school based after-school programs, researchers find that disadvantaged children participate in these programs at significantly lower rates. They find that low-income students have less access due to challenges with regard to transportation, non-nominal fees, and off-campus safety. Therefore, reducing or eliminating these opportunities would most likely deprive disadvantaged students of the benefits from athletic participation, not least of which is the opportunity to interact with positive role models outside of regular school hours.
[K] Another unfounded criticism that Ripley makes is bringing up the stereotype that athletic coaches are typically lousy (蹩脚的）classroom teachers. “American principals, unlike the vast majority of principals around the world, make many hiring decisions with their sports teams in mind, which does not always end well for students.” she writes. Educators who seek employment at schools primarily for the purpose of coaching are likely to shirk (推卸) teaching responsibilities, the argument goes. Moreover, even in the cases where the employee is a teacher first and athletic coach second, the additional responsibilities that come with coaching likely come at the expense of time otherwise spent on planning, grading, and communicating with parents and guardians.
[L] The data, however, do not seem to confirm this stereotype. In the most rigorous study on the classroom results of high school coaches, the University of Arkansas’s Anna Egalite finds that athletic coaches in Florida mostly tend to perform just as well as their non-coaching counterparts, with respect to raising student test scores. We do not doubt that teachers who also coach face serious tradeoffs that likely come at the expense of time they could dedicate to their academic obligations. However, as with sporting events, athletic coaches gain additional opportunities for communicating and serving as mentors (导师）that potentially help students succeed and make up for the costs of coaching commitments.
[M] If schools allow student-athletes to regularly miss out on instructional time for the sake of traveling to athletic competitions, that’s bad. However, such issues would be better addressed by changing school and state policies with regard to the scheduling of sporting events as opposed to total elimination. If the empirical evidence points to anything, it points towards school-sponsored sports providing assets that are well worth the costs.
[N] Despite negative stereotypes about sports culture and Ripley’s presumption that academics and athletics are at odds with one another, we believe that the greater body of evidence shows that school-sponsored sports programs appear to benefit students. Successes on the playing field can carry over to the classroom and vice versa (反之亦然）. More importantly, finding ways to increase school communities’ social capital is imperative to the success of the school as a whole, not just the athletes.

Section C
Directions： There are 2 passages in this section • Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　It is easy to miss amid the day-to-day headlines of global economic recession, but there is a less conspicuous kind of social upheaval (剧变) underway that is fast altering both the face of the planet and the way human beings live. That change is the rapid acceleration of urbanization. In 2008, for the first time in human history, more than half the world’s population was living in towns and cities. And as a recently published paper shows, the process of urbanization will only accelerate in the decades to come-with an enormous impact on biodiversity and potentially on climate change.
　　As Karen Seto, the lead author of the paper, points out, the wave of urbanization isn’t just about the migration of people into urban environments, but about the environments themselves becoming bigger to accommodate all those people. The rapid expansion of urban areas will have a huge impact on biodiversity hotspots and on carbon emissions in those urban areas.
　　Humans are the ultimate invasive species—when they move into new territory, they often displace the wildlife that was already living there. And as land is cleared for those new cities —especially in the dense tropical forests—carbon will be released into the atmosphere as well. It’s true that as people in developing nations move from the countryside to the city, the shift may reduce the pressure on land, which could in turn be good for the environment. This is especially so in desperately poor countries, where residents in the countryside slash and burn forests each growing season to clear space for farming. But the real difference is that in developing nations, the move from rural areas to cities often leads to an accompanying increase in income —and that increase leads to an increase in the consumption of food and energy, which in turn causes a rise in carbon emissions. Getting enough to eat and enjoying the safety and comfort of living fully on the grid is certainly a good thing —but it does carry an environmental price.
　　The urbanization wave can’t be stopped —and it shouldn’t be. But Seto’s paper does underscore the importance of managing that transition. If we do it the right way, we can reduce urbanization’s impact on the environment. “There’s an enormous opportunity here, and a lot of pressure and responsibility to think about how we urbanize,” says Seto. “One thing that’s clear is that we can’t build cities the way we have over the last couple of hundred years. The scale of this transition won’t allow that. ” We’re headed towards an urban planet no matter what, but whether it becomes heaven or hell is up to us.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　When Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched thefacebook. com in Feb. 2004, even he could not imagine the forces it would let loose. His intent was to connect college students.  Facebook,  which is what this website rapidly evolved into, ended up connecting the world.
　　To the children of this connected era, the world is one giant social network. They are not bound —as were previous generations of humans一by what they were taught. They are only limited by their curiosity and ambition. During my childhood, all knowledge was local. You learned everything you knew from your parents, teachers, preachers, and friends.
　　With the high-quality and timely information at their fingertips, today’s children are rising above the fears and biases of their parents. Adults are also participating in this revolution. India’s normally tame middle class is speaking up against social ills. Silicon Valley executives are being shamed into adding women to their boards. Political leaders are marshalling the energy of millions for elections and political causes. All of this is being done with social media technologies that Facebook and its competitors set free.
　　As does every advancing technology, social media has created many new problems. It is commonly addictive and creates risks for younger users. Social media is used by extremists in the Middle East and elsewhere to seek and brainwash recruits. And it exposes us and our friends to disagreeable spying. We may leave our lights on in the house when we are on vacation, but through social media we tell criminals exactly where we are, when we plan to return home, and how to blackmail（敲诈）us.
　　Governments don’t need informers any more. Social media allows government agencies to spy on their own citizens. We record our thoughts, emotions, likes and dislikes on Facebook； we share our political views, social preferences, and plans. We post intimate photographs of ourselves. No spy agency or criminal organization could actively gather the type of data that we voluntarily post for them.
　　The marketers are also seeing big opportunities. Amazon is trying to predict what we will order. Google is trying to judge our needs and wants based on our social-media profiles. We need to be aware of the risks and keep working to alleviate the dangers.
　　Regardless of what social media people use, one thing is certain： we are in a period of accelerating change. The next decade will be even more amazing and unpredictable than the last. Just as no one could predict what would happen with social media in the last decade, no one can accurately predict where this technology will take us. I am optimistic, however, that a connected humanity will find a way to uplift itself.

说明：2014年12月大学英语六级真题全国共考了两套听力。本套（即第三套）的听力材料与第一套完全一样，只是选项的顺序不同而已，故本套不再重复给出。
Section C
Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time,you should listen carefully for its general idea.  When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.
    If you're like most people, you've indulged in fake listening many times. You go to history class, sit in the third row, and look squarely at the instructor as she speaks. But your mind is far away,26inthe clouds of pleasant daydreams. Occasionally you come back to earth: The instructor writes an important term on the chalkboard, and you   27copy it in your notebook. Every once in a while the instructor makes a   28remark, causing others in the class to laugh. You smile politely, pretending that you've heard the remark and found it mildly humorous. You have a vague sense of   29that you aren't paying close attention, but you tell yourself that any material you miss can   30from a friend's notes. Besides, the instructor's talking about road   31in ancient Rome, and nothing could be more boring. So back you go into your private little world. Only later do you realize you've missed important information for a test.
    Fake listening may be easily exposed, since many speakers   32facial cues and can tell if you're merely pretending to listen. Your blank expression and the faraway look in your eyes are the cues that33your inattentiveness.
 Even if you're not exposed, there's another reason to avoid fakery: It's easy for this34tobecome a habit. For some people, the habit is so deeply rooted that they automatically start day dreaming when a speaker begins talking on something35or uninteresting. As a result, they miss lots of valuable information.

Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
    It was 10 years ago, on a warm July night, that a newborn lamb took her first breath in a small shed
in Scotland. From the outside, she looked no different from thousands of other sheep born on  36  farms. But Dolly, as the world soon came to realize, was no 37 lamb. She was cloned from a single cell of an adult female sheep, 38 long-held scientific dogma that had declared such a thing biologically impossible.
   A decade later, scientists are starting to come to grips with just how different Dolly was. Dozens of animals have been cloned since that first lamb_mice, cats, cows and, most recently, a dog—and it's becoming  39  clear that they are all, in one way or another, defective.
    It's  40 to think of clones as perfect carbon copies of the original. It turns out, though, that there are various degrees of genetic 41 . That may come as a shock to people who have paid thousands of dollars to clone a pet cat only to discover that the baby cat looks and behaves  42  liketheir beloved pet—with a different-color coat of fur, perhaps, or a  43  different attitude toward its human hosts.
    And these are just the obvious differences. Not only are clones  44  from the original template(模板) by time, but they are also the product of an unnatural molecular mechanism that turns out not to be very good at making  45 copies. In fact, the process can embed small flaws in the genes of clones that scientists are only  now discovering

  Should Single-Sex Education Be Eliminated?
A）Why is a neuroscientist here debating single-sex schooling? Honestly, I had no fixed ideas on the topic when I started researching it for my book, Pink Brain, Blue Brain. But any discussion of gender differences in children inevitably leads to this debate, so I felt compelled to dive into the research data on single-sex schooling. I read every study I could, weighed the existing evidence, and ultimately concluded that single-sex education is not the answer to gender gaps in achievement--or the best way forward for today's young people. After my book was published, I met several developmental and cognitive psychologists whose work was addressing gender and education from different angles, and we published a peer-reviewed Education Forum piece in Science magazine with the provocative title, "The Pseudoscience of Single-Sex Education."
B）We showed that three lines of research used to justify single-sex schooling--educational, neuroscience, and social psychology--all fail to support its alleged benefits, and so the widely-held view that gender separation is somehow better for boys, girls, or both is nothing more than a myth.
The Research on Academic Outcomes.
C） First, we reviewed the extensive educational research that has compared academic outcomes in students attending single-sex versus coeducational schools. The overwhelming conclusion when you put this enormous literature together is that there is no clear academic advantage of sitting in all-female or all-male classes, in spite of much popular belief to the contrary. I base this conclusion not on any individual study, but on large-scale and systematic reviews of thousands of studies conducted in every major English-speaking country.
D）Of course, there’re many excellent single-sex schools out there, but as these careful research reviews have demonstrated, it's not their single-sex composition that makes them excellent.  It's all the other advantages that are typically packed into such schools, such as financial resources, quality of the faculty, and pro-academic culture, along with the family background and pre-selected ability of the students themselves that determine their outcomes.
E）A case in point is the study by Linda Sax at UCLA, who used data from a large national survey of college freshmen to evaluate the effect of single-sex versus coeducational high schools. Commissioned by the National Coalition of Girls' Schools, the raw findings look pretty good for the funders--higher SAT scores and a stronger academic orientation among women who had attended all girls' high schools (men weren't studied). However, once the researchers controlled for both student and school attributes--measures such as family income, parents' education, and school resources--most of these effects were erased or diminished.
F）When it comes to boys in particular, the data show that single-sex education is distinctly unhelpful for them. Among the minority of studies that have reported advantages of single-sex schooling, virtually all of them were studies of girls. There're no rigorous studies in the United States that find single-sexschooling is better for boys, and in fact, a separate line of research by economists has shown both boys and girls exhibit greater cognitive growth over the school year based on the "dose" of girls in a classroom. In fact, boys benefit even more than girls from having larger numbers of female classmates. So single-sex schooling is really not the answer to the current "boy crisis" in education.
Brain and Cognitive Development
G）The second line of research often used to justify single-sex education falls squarely within my area of expertise: brain and cognitive development. It's been more than a decade now since the "brain sex movement" began infiltrating (渗入) our schools, and there are literally hundreds of schools caught up in the fad (新潮). Public schools in Wisconsin, Indiana, Florida and many other states now proudly declare on their websites that they separate boys and girls because "research solidly indicates that boys and girls learn differently," due to "hard-wired" differences in their brains, eyes, ears, autonomic nervous systems, and more.
H）All of these statements can be traced to just a few would-be neuroscientists, especially physician Leonard Sax and therapist Michael Gurian. Each gives lectures, runs conferences, and does a lot of professional development on so-called "gender-specific learning." [ analyzed their various claims about sex difference sin hearing, vision, language, math, stress responses, and "learning styles" in my book and a long peer-reviewed paper. Other neuroscientists and psychologists have similarly exposed their work. In short, the mechanisms by which our brains learn language, math, physics, and every other subject don't differ between boys and girls. Of course, learning does vary a lot between individual students, but research reliably shows that this variance is far greater within populations of boys or girls than between the two sexes.
I）The equal protection clause of the US Constitution prohibits separation of students by sex in public education that's based on precisely this kind of "over broad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females." And the reason it is prohibited is because it leads far too easily to stereotyping and sex discrimination.
Social Developmental Psychology
J）That brings me to the third area of research which fails to support single-sex schooling and indeed
　　suggests the practice is actually harmful: social developmental psychology.
K）It's a well-proven finding in social psychology that segregation promotes stereotyping and prejudice, whereas inter group contact reduces them--and the results are the same whether you divide groups by race, age, gender, body mass index, sexual orientation, or any other category. What's more, children are especially vulnerable to this kind of bias, because they are dependent on adults for learning which social categories are important and why we divide people into different groups.
L）You don't have to look far to find evidence of stereotyping and sex discrimination in single-sex schools. There was the failed single-sex experiment in California, where six school districts used generous state grants to set up separate boys' and girls' academics in the late 1990s. Once boys and girls were segregated, teachers resorted to traditional gender stereotypes to run their classes, and within just three years, five of the six districts had gone back to coeducation.
M）At the same time, researchers are increasingly discovering benefits of gender interaction in youth. A large British study found that children with other-sex older siblings (兄弟姐妹) exhibit less stereotypical play than children with same-sex older siblings, such as girls who like sports and building toys and boys who like art and dramatic play. Another study of high school social networks found less bullying and aggression the higher the density of mixed-sex friendships within a given adolescent network. Then there is the finding we cited in our Science paper of higher divorce and depression rates among a large group of British men who attended single-sex schools as teenagers, which might be explained by the lack of opportunity to learn about relationships during their formative years.
N）Whether in nursery school, high school, or the business world, gender segregation narrows our perceptions of each other, facilitating stereotyping and sexist attitudes. It's very simple: the more we structure children and adolescents' environment around gender distinctions and separation, the more they will use these categories as the primary basis for understanding themselves and others.
O）Gender is an important issue in education. There are gaps in reading, writing, and science achievement that should be narrower. There are gaps in career choice that should be narrower--if we really want to maximize human potential and American economic growth. But stereotyping boys and girls them in the name of fictitious (虚拟的) brain differences is never going to close these gaps.

.Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
     International governments' inaction concerning sustainable development is clearly worrying but the proactive (主动出击的) approaches of some leading-edge companies are encouraging. Toyota, Wal-Mart, DuPont, M&S and General Electric have made tackling environmental wastes a key economic driver.
    DuPont committed itself to a 65% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the 10 years prior to 2010.By 2007, DuPont was saving $2.2 billion a year through energy efficiency, the same as its total declared profits that year. General Electric aims to reduce the energy intensity of its operations by 50% by 2015.They have invested heavily in projects designed to change the way of using and conserving energy.
    Companies like Toyota and Wal-Mart are not committing to environmental goals out of the goodness of their hearts. The reason for their actions is a simple yet powerful realisation that the environmental and economic footprints fit well together. When M&S launched its "Plan A" sustainability programme in 2007,it was believed that it would cost over ~200 million in the first five years. However, the initiative had generated ~105 million by 2011/12.
    When we prevent physical waste, increase energy efficiency or improve resource productivity, we save money, improve profitability and enhance competitiveness. In fact, there are often huge "quick win" opportunities, thanks to years of neglect.
    However, there is a considerable gap between leading-edge companies and the rest of the pack. There are far too many companies still delaying creating a lean and green business system, arguing that it will cost money or require sizable capital investments. They remain stuck in the "environment is cost" mentality. Being environmentally friendly does not have to cost money. In fact, going beyond compliance saves cost at the same time that it generates cash, provided that management adopts the new lean and green model.
    Lean means doing more with less. Nonetheless, in most companies, economic and environmental continuous improvement is viewed as being in conflict with each other. This is one of the biggest opportunities missed across most industries. The size of the opportunity is enormous, The 3% Reportrecently published by World Wildlife Fund and CDP shows that the economic prize for curbing carbonemissions in the US economy is $780 billion between now and 2020. It suggests that one of the biggest levers for delivering this opportunity is "increased efficiency through management and behavioural change"--in other words, lean and green management.
    Some 50 studies show that companies that commit to such a spirational goals as zero waste, zero harmful emissions,  and zero use of non-renewable resources are financially outperforming their competitors. Conversely, it was found that climate disruption is already costing $1.2 trillion annually, cutting global GDP by 1.6%. Unaddressed, this will double by 2030.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　 If you asked me to describe the rising philosophy of the day, I'd say it is data-ism. We now have the ability to gather huge amounts of data. This ability seems to carry with it certain cultural assumptions--that everything that can be measured should be measured; that data is a transparent and reliable lens that allows us to filter out emotionalism and ideology; that data will help us do remarkable things--like foretell the future.
　　 Over the next years, I'm hoping to get a better grip on some of the questions raised by the datarevolution: In what situations should we rely on intuitive pattern recognition and in which situations should we ignore intuition and follow the data? What kinds of events are predictable using statistical analysis and what sorts of events are not?
　　 I confess I enter this in a skeptical frame of mind, believing that we tend to get carried away in our desire to reduce everything to the quantifiable. But at the outset let me celebrate two things data does really well.
　　 First, it's really good at exposing when our intuitive view of reality is wrong. For example, nearly every person who runs for political office has an intuitive sense that they can powerfully influence their odds of winning the election if they can just raise and spend more money. But this is largely wrong.
    After the 2006 election, Sean Trende constructed a graph comparing the incumbent (在任者的)
campaign spending advantages with their eventual margins of victory. There was barely any relationship between more spending and a bigger victory.
　　 Likewise, many teachers have an intuitive sense that different students have different learning styles: some are verbal and some are visual; some are linear, some are holistic (整体的). Teachers imagine they will improve outcomes if they tailor their presentations to each student. But there's no evidence to support this either.
    Second, data can illuminate patterns of behavior we haven't yet noticed. For example, I've always assumed people who frequently use words like "I," "me," and "mine" are probably more self-centered than people who don't. But as James Pennebaker of the University of Texas notes in his book, The Secret Life of Pronouns, when people are feeling confident, they are focused on the task at hand, not on themselves. High-status, confident people use fewer "I" words, not more.
     Our brains often don't notice subtle verbal patterns, but Pennebaker's computers can. Younger writers use more negative and past-tense words than older writers who use more positive and future tense words.
 In sum, the data revolution is giving us wonderful ways to understand the present and the past. Will it
transform our ability to predict and make decisions about the future? We'll see.

61. What do data-ists assume they can do?
　A.Transform people's cultural identity. 
　B.Change the way future events unfold.

63. Why do many teachers favor the idea of tailoring their presentations to different students?
　A.They think students prefer flexible teaching methods.
　B.They will be able to try different approaches.
　C.They believe students' learning styles vary.
　D.They can accommodate students with special needs.
64. What does James Pennebaker reveal in The Secret Life of Pronouns?

　B.Repeated use of first-person pronouns by self-centered people.

Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　children are natural-born scientists. They have    36    minds，and they aren’t afraid to admit they don’t know something. Most of them,    37   ，lose this as they get older. They become self-conscious  and don’t want to appear stupid. Instead of finding things out for themselves they make    38    that often turn out to be wrong.
　　　So it’s not a case of getting kids interested in science. You just have to avoid killing the     39     for learning that they were born with. It’s no coincidence that kids start deserting science once it becomes formalised. Children naturally have a blurred approach to    40    knowledge. They see learning about science or biology or cooking as all part of the same act—it’s all learning. It’s only because of the practicalities of education that you have to start breaking down the curriculum into specialist subjects. You need to have specialist teachers who	41    what they know. Thus once they enter school, children begin to define subjects and erect boundaries that needn’t otherwise exist.

Section B
Directions： In this section^ you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Meaning Is Healthier Than Happiness
[A] For at least the last decade, the happiness craze has been building. In the last three months alone, over 1 000 books on happiness were released on Amazon, including Happy Money, Happy-People-Pills For All, and, for those just starting out, Happiness for Beginners.
[B] One of the consistent claims of books like these is that happiness is associated with all sorts of good life outcomes, including—most promisingly —good health. Many studies have noted the connection between a happy mind and a healthy body —the happier we are, the better health outcomes we seem to have. In an overview of 150 studies on this topic, researchers put it like this： “Inductions of well-being lead to healthy functioning, and inductions of ill-being lead to compromised health.”
[C] But a new study, just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) challenges the rosy picture. Happiness may not be as good for the body as researchers thought. It might even be bad.
[D]  Of course, it’s important to first define Happiness. A few months ago, I wrote a piece called “There’s More to Life Than   Being Happy” about a psychology study that dug into what happiness really means to people. It specifically explored the difference between a meaningful life and a happy life.
[E] It seems strange that there would be a difference at all. But the researchers, who looked at a large sample of people over a month-long period, found that happiness is associated with selfish “taking” behavior and that having a sense of meaning in life is associated with selfless “giving” behavior.
[F] “Happiness without meaning characterizes a relatively shallow, self-absorbed or even selfish life, in which things go well, needs and desires are easily satisfied, and complicated relationships are avoided”, the authors of the study wrote. “If anything, pure happiness is linked to not helping others in need.” While being happy is about feeling good, meaning is derived from contributing to others or to society in a bigger way. As Roy Baumeister,  one of the researchers, told me, “Partly what we do as human beings is to take care of others and contribute to others. This makes life meaningful but it does not necessarily make us happy. ”
[G] The new PNAS study also sheds light on the difference between meaning and happiness, but on the biological level. Barbara Fredrickson, a psychological researcher at the University of North Carolina- Chapel Hill, and Steve Cole, a genetics and psychiatry(精神病学)	researcher at UCLA, examined the self-reported levels of happiness and meaning in 80 research subjects.
[H] Happiness was defined, as in the earlier study, by feeling good. The researchers measured happiness by asking subjects     questions like “How often did you feel happy?' “How often did you feel interested in life?” and “How often did you feel satisfied?” The more strongly people endorsed these measures of “hedonic (享乐主义的）well-being，” or pleasure, the higher they scored on happiness.
[I] Meaning was defined as an orientation to something bigger than the self. They measured meaning by asking questions like   “How often did you feel that your life has a sense of direction or meaning to it?” and “How often did you feel that you had something to contribute to society?” The more people endorsed these measures of “eudaimonic (幸福论的）well-being”-or, simply put, virtue —the more meaning they felt in life.
[J] After noting the sense of meaning and happiness that each subject had, Fredrickson and Cole, with their research colleagues, looked at the ways certain genes expressed themselves in each of the participants. Like neuroscientists who use	fMRI(功育磁共振成像）scanning to determine how regions in the brain respond to different stimuli, Cole and Fredrickson are interested in how the body, at the genetic level, responds to feelings of happiness and meaning.
[K]  Cole’s past work has linked various kinds of chronic adversity to a particular gene expression pattern. When people feel lonely, are grieving the loss of a loved one, or are struggling to make ends meet, their bodies go into threat mode. This triggers the activation of a stress-related gene pattern that has two features： an increase in the activity of pro-inflammatory(促炎症的)genes and a decrease in the activity of genes involved in anti-viral responses.
[L] Cole and Fredrickson found that people who are happy but have little to no sense of meaning in their lives have the same   gene expression patterns as people who are responding to and enduring chronic adversity. That is, the bodies of these happy people are preparing them for bacterial threats by activating the pro-inflammatory response. Chronic inflammation is, of course, associated with major illnesses like heart disease and various cancers.
[M] “Empty positive emotions”-like the kind people experience during manic (狂喜的）episodes or artificially induced euphoria (欣快）from alcohol and drugs—“are about as good for you as adversity，” says Fredrickson.
[N] It’s important to understand that for many people, a sense of meaning and happiness in life overlap； many people score jointly high (or jointly low) on the happiness and meaning measures in the study. But for many others, there is a dissonance (不一致）-they feel that they are low on happiness and high on meaning or that their lives are very high in happiness, but low in meaning. This last group, which has the gene expression pattern associated with adversity, formed 75 percent of study participants. Only one quarter of the study participants had what the researchers call “eudaimonic predominance”-that is, their sense of meaning outpaced their feelings of happiness.
[O] This is too bad given the more beneficial gene expression pattern associated with meaningfulness. People whose levels of happiness and meaning line up, and people who have a strong sense of meaning but are not necessarily happy, showed a de-activation of the adversity stress response. Their bodies were not preparing them for the bacterial infections that we get when we are alone or in trouble, but for the viral infections we get when surrounded by a lot of other people.
[P] Fredrickson’s past research, described in her two books, Positivity and Love 2.0, has mapped the benefits of positive emotions in individuals. She has found that positive emotions broaden a person’s perspective and help protect people against adversity. So it was surprising to her that hedonic wellbeing, which is associated with positive emotions and pleasure, did so badly in this study compared with eudaimonic well-being.
[Q]  “It’s not the amount of hedonic happiness that’s a problem.” Fredrickson tells me, “It’s that it’s not matched by eudaimonic well-being. It’s great when both are in step. But if you have more hedonic well-being than would be expected, that’s when this [gene] pattern that’s similar to adversity emerged. ”
[R] The terms hedonism and eudaimonism bring to mind the great philosophical debate, which has shaped Western civilization for over 2 000 years, about the nature of the good life. Does happiness lie in feeling good, as hedonists think, or in doing and being good, as Aristotle and his intellectual descendants, the ethicists(伦理学家），think? From the evidence of this study, it seems that feeling good is not enough. People need meaning to thrive. In the words of Carl Jung, “The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.” Jung’s wisdom certainly seems to apply to our bodies, if not also to our hearts and our minds.

Section C
Directions： There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　Nothing succeeds in business books like the study of success. The current business-book boom was launched in 1982 by Tom Peters and Robert Waterman with In Search of Excellence. The trend has continued with a succession of experts and would-be experts who promise to distil the essence of excellence into three (or five or seven) simple rules.
　　The Three Rules is a self-conscious contribution to this type of writing； it even includes a bibliography of “success studies”. Michael Raynor and Mumtaz Ahmed work for a consultancy, Deloitte, that is determined to turn itself into more of a thought-leader and less a corporate repairman. They employ all the tricks of the success books. They insist that their conclusions are “measurable and actionable”-guides to behaviour rather than analysis for its own sake. Success authors usually serve up vivid stories about how exceptional businesspeople stamped their personalities on a company or rescued it from a life-threatening crisis. Messrs Raynor and Ahmed are happier chewing the numbers： they provide detailed appendices on “calculating the elements of advantage” and “detailed analysis”.
　　The authors spent five years studying the behaviour of their 344 “ exceptional companies” only to come up at first with nothing. Every hunch (直觉) led to a blind alley and every hypothesis to a dead end. It was only when they shifted their attention from how companies behave to how they think that they began to make sense of their voluminous material.
　　Management is all about making difficult tradeoffs in conditions that are always uncertain and often fast-changing. But exceptional companies approach these tradeoffs with two simple rules in mind, sometimes consciously, sometimes unconsciously. First： better before cheaper. Companies are more likely to succeed in the long run if they compete on quality or performance than on price. Second： revenue before cost. Companies have more to gain in the long run from driving up revenue than by driving down costs.
　　Most success studies suffer from two faults. There is “the halo (光环）effect”, whereby good performance leads commentators to attribute all manner of virtues to anything and everything the company does. These virtues then suddenly become vices when the company fails. Messrs Raynor and Ahmed work hard to avoid these mistakes by studying large bodies of data over several decades. But they end up embracing a different error： stating the obvious. Most businesspeople will not be surprised to learn that it is better to find a profitable	niche(隙缝市场）and focus on boosting your revenues than to compete on
price and cut your way to success. The difficult question is how to find that profitable niche and protect it. There, The Three Rules is less useful.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　Until recently, the University of Kent prided itself on its friendly image. Not any more. Over the past few months it has been working hard, with the help of media consultants, to play down its cosy reputation in favour of something more academic and serious.
　　Kent is not alone in considering an image revamp (翻新）,Changes to next year’s funding regime are forcing universities to justify charging students up to £9 000 in fees.
　　Nowadays universities are putting much more of a focus on their brands and what their value propositions are. While in the past universities have often focused on student social life and attractions of the university town in recruitment campaigns, they are now concentrating on more tangible (实在的） attractions, such as employment prospects, engagement with industry, and lecturer contact hours, making clear exactly what students are going to get for their money.
　　The problem for universities is that if those benefits fail to materialise, students notice. That worries Rob Behrens, who deals with student complaints. “Universities need to be extremely careful in describing what’s going to happen to students，” he says. “As competition is going to get greater for attracting gifted students, there is a danger that universities will go the extra mile.
　　One university told prospective engineering students they would be able to design a car and race it at Brands Hatch, which never happened, he says. Others have promised use of sophisticated equipment that turned out to be broken or unavailable. “If universities spent as much money on handling complaints and appeals appropriately as they spend on marketing, they would do better at keeping students, and in the National Student Survey returns，” he says.
　　Ongoing research tracking prospective 2012 students suggests that they are not only becoming more sophisticated in thinking about what they want from a university, but are also spending more time researching evidence to back up institutional claims.
　　Hence the growing importance of the student survey. From next September, all institutions will also be expected to publish on their websites key information sets, allowing easier comparison between institutions, between promises and reality, and the types of jobs and salaries graduates go on to.
　　As a result, it is hardly surprising that universities are beginning to change the way they market themselves. While the best form of marketing for institutions is to be good at what they do, they also need to be clear about how they are different from others.
　　And it is vital that once an institution claims to be particularly good at something, it must live up to it. The moment you position yourself, you become exposed, and if you fail in that you are in trouble.

　　反映在艺术和文学中的乡村生活理想是中国文明的重要特征。这在很大程度上归功于道家（Taoist) 对自然的情感。传统中国画有两个最受青睐的主题，一是家庭生活的各种幸福场景，画中往往有老人在饮茶下棋，男人在耕耘收割，妇女在织布缝衣，小孩在户外玩耍。另一个则是乡村生活的种种乐趣，画有渔夫 在湖上打渔，农夫在山上欲柴采药，或是书生坐在松树下呤诗作画。这两个主题可以分别代表儒家 (Confucian)和道家的生活理想。

Section B
Directions：In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify, the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Why the Mona Lisa Stands Out

[A] Have you ever fallen for a novel and been amazed not to find it on lists of great books? Or walked around a sculpture renowned as a classic, struggling to see what the fuss is about? If so, you’ve probably pondered the question a psychologist, James Cutting, asked himself: How does a work of art come to be considered great?
[B] The intuitive answer is that some works of art are just great: of intrinsically superior quality. The paintings that win prime spots in galleries, get taught in classes and reproduced in books are the ones that have proved their artistic value over time. If you can’t see they’re superior, that’s your problem. It’s an intimidatingly neat explanation. But some social scientists have been asking awkward questions of it, raising the possibility that artistic canons (名作目录) are little more than fossilised historical accidents.
[C] Cutting, a professor at Cornell University, wondered if a psychological mechanism known as the “mere-exposure effect” played a role in deciding which paintings rise to the top of the cultural league. Cutting designed an experiment to test his hunch (直觉). Over a lecture course he regularly showed undergraduates works of impressionism for two seconds at a time. Some of the paintings were canonical, included in art-history books. Others were lesser known but of comparable quality. These were exposed four times as often. Afterwards, the students preferred them to the canonical works, while a control group of students liked the canonical ones best. Cutting’s students had grown to like those paintings more simply because they had seen them more.
[D] Cutting believes his experiment offers a clue as to how canons are formed. He points out that the most reproduced works of impressionism today tend to have been bought by five or six wealthy and influential collectors in the late 19th century. The preferences of these men bestowed (给予) prestige on certain works, which made the works more likely to be hung in galleries and printed in collections. The fame passed down the years, gaining momentum from mere exposure as it did so. The more people were exposed to, the more they liked it, and the more they liked it, the more it appeared in books, on posters and in big exhibitions. Meanwhile, academics and critics created sophisticated justifications for its preeminence (卓越). After all, it’s not just the masses who tend to rate what they see more often more highly. As contemporary artists like Warhol and Damien Hirst have grasped, critics’ praise is deeply entwined (交织) with publicity. “Scholars”, Cutting argues, “are no different from the public in the effects of mere exposure.”
[E] The process described by Cutting evokes a principle that the sociologist Duncan Watts calls “cumulative advantage”: once a thing becomes popular, it will tend to become more popular still. A few years ago, Watts, who is employed by Microsoft to study the dynamics of social networks, had a similar experience to Cutting‘s in another Paris museum. After queuing to see the “Mona Lisa” in its climate- controlled bulletproof box at the Louvre, he came away puzzled: why was it considered so superior to the three other Leonardos in the previous chamber, to which nobody seemed to be paying the slightest attention?
[F] When Watts looked into the history of “the greatest painting of all time”, he discovered that, for most of its life, the “Mona Lisa” remained in relative obscurity. In the 1850s, Leonardo da Vinci was considered no match for giants of Renaissance art like Titian and Raphael, whose works were worth almost ten times as much as the “Mona Lisa”. It was only in the 20th century that Leonardo’s portrait of his patron’s wife rocketed to the number-one spot. What propelled it there wasn’t a scholarly re- evaluation, but a theft.
[G] In 1911 a maintenance worker at the Louvre walked out of the museum with the “Mona Lisa” hidden under his smock (工作服). Parisians were shocked at the theft of a painting to which, until then, they had paid little attention. When the museum reopened, people queued to see the gap where the “Mona Lisa” had once hung in a way they had never done for the painting itself. From then on, the “Mona Lisa” came to represent Western culture itself.
[H] Although many have tried, it does seem improbable that the painting’s unique status can be attributed entirely to the quality of its brushstrokes. It has been said that the subject’s eyes follow the viewer around the room. But as the painting’s biographer, Donald Sassoon, dryly notes, “In reality the effect can be obtained from any portrait.” Duncan Watts proposes that the “Mona Lisa” is merely an extreme example of a general rule. Paintings, poems and pop songs are buoyed (使浮起) or sunk by random events or preferences that turn into waves of influence, passing down the generations.
[I] “Saying that cultural objects have value,” Brian Eno once wrote, “is like saying that telephones have conversations.” Nearly all the cultural objects we consume arrive wrapped in inherited opinion; our preferences are always, to some extent, someone else’s. Visitors to the “Mona Lisa” know they are about to visit the greatest work of art ever and come away appropriately impressed—or let down. An audience at a performance of “Hamlet” know it is regarded as a work of genius, so that is what they mostly see. Watts even calls the preeminence of Shakespeare a “historical accident”.
[J] Although the rigid high-low distinction fell apart in the 1960s, we still use culture as a badge of identity. Today’s fashion for eclecticism (折衷主义)—“I love Bach, Abba and Jay Z”—is, Shamus Khan, a Columbia University psychologist, argues, a new way for the middle class to distinguish themselves from what they perceive to be the narrow tastes of those beneath them in the social hierarchy.
[K] The intrinsic quality of a work of art is starting to seem like its least important attribute. But perhaps it’s more significant than our social scientists allow. First of all, a work needs a certain quality to be eligible to be swept to the top of the pile. The “Mona Lisa” may not be a worthy world champion, but it was in the Louvre in the first place, and not by accident. Secondly, some stuff is simply better than other stuff. Read “Hamlet” after reading even the greatest of Shakespeare’s contemporaries, and the difference may strike you as unarguable.
[L] A study in the British Journal of Aesthetics suggests that the exposure effect doesn’t work the same way on everything, and points to a different conclusion about how canons are formed. The social scientists are right to say that we should be a little sceptical of greatness, and that we should always look in the next room. Great art and mediocrity (平庸)can get confused, even by experts. But that’s why we need to see, and read, as much as we can. The more we’re exposed to the good and the bad, the better we are at telling the difference. The eclecticists have it.

46. According to Duncan Watts, the superiority of the “Mona Lisa” to Leonardo’s other works resulted from the cumulative advantage.
47. Some social scientists have raised doubts about the intrinsic value of certain works of art.
48. It is often random events or preferences that determine the fate of a piece of art.
49. In his experiment, Cutting found that his subjects liked lesser known works better than canonical works because of more exposure.
50. The author thinks the greatness of an art work still lies in its intrinsic value.
51. It is true of critics as well as ordinary people that the popularity of artistic works is closely associated with publicity.
52. We need to expose ourselves to more art and literature in order to tell the superior from the inferior.
53. A study of the history of the greatest paintings suggests even a great work of art could experience years of neglect.
54. Culture is still used as a mark to distinguish one social class from another.
55. Opinions about and preferences for cultural objects are often inheritable.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　When the right person is holding the right job at the right moment, that person’s influence is greatly expanded. That is the position in which Janet Yellen, who is expected to be confirmed as the next chair of the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) in January, now finds herself. If you believe, as many do, that unemployment is the major economic and social concern of our day, then it is no stretch to think Yellen is the most powerful person in the world right now.
　　　Throughout the 2008 financial crisis and the recession and recovery that followed, central banks have taken on the role of stimulators of last resort, holding up the global economy with vast amounts of money in the form of asset buying. Yellen, previously a Fed vice chair, was one of the principal architects of the Fed’s $3.8 trillion money dump. A star economist known for her groundbreaking work on labor markets, Yellen was a kind of prophetess early on in the crisis for her warnings about the subprime (次级债) meltdown. Now it will be her job to get the Fed and the markets out of the biggest and most unconventional monetary program in history without derailing the fragile recovery.
　　　The good news is that Yellen, 67, is particularly well suited to meet these challenges. She has a keen understanding of financial markets, an appreciation for their imperfections and a strong belief that human suffering was more related to unemployment than anything else.
　　　Some experts worry that Yellen will be inclined to chase unemployment to the neglect of inflation. But with wages still relatively flat and the economy increasingly divided between the well-off and the long-term unemployed, more people worry about the opposite, deflation (通货紧缩) that would aggravate the economy’s problems.
　　　Either way, the incoming Fed chief will have to walk a fine line in slowly ending the stimulus. It must be steady enough to deflate bubbles (去泡沫) and bring markets back down to earth but not so quick that it creates another credit crisis.
　　　Unlike many past Fed leaders, Yellen is not one to buy into the finance industry’s argument that it should be left alone to regulate itself. She knows all along the Fed has been too slack on regulation of finance.
　　　Yellen is likely to address the issue right after she pushes unemployment below 6%, stabilizes markets and makes sure that the recovery is more inclusive and robust. As Princeton Professor Alan Blinder says, “She’s smart as a whip, deeply logical, willing to argue but also a good listener. She can persuade without creating hostility.” All those traits will be useful as the global economy’s new power player takes on its most annoying problems.
56. What do many people think is the biggest problem facing Janet Yellen?
A) Lack of money.	     
B) Subprime crisis.	      
C) Unemployment.
D) Social instability.
57. What did Yellen help the Fed do to tackle the 2008 financial crisis?
A) Take effective measures to curb inflation.
B) Deflate the bubbles in the American economy.
C) Formulate policies to help financial institutions.
D) Pour money into the market through asset buying.
58.What is a greater concern of the general public?
A) Recession.	          
B) Deflation.	          
C) Inequality.
D) Income.
59. What is Yellen likely to do in her position as the Fed chief?
A) Develop a new monetary program.	  
B) Restore public confidence.            
C) Tighten financial regulation.
D) Reform the credit system.
60. How does Alan Blinder portray Yellen?
A) She possesses strong persuasive power.	   
B) She has confidence in what she is doing.	   
C) She is one of the world’s greatest economists.
D) She is the most powerful Fed chief in history.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Air pollution is deteriorating in many places around the world. The fact that public parks in cities become crowded as soon as the sun shines proves that people long to breathe in green, open spaces. They do not all know what they are seeking but they flock there, nevertheless. And, in these surroundings, they are generally both peaceful and peaceable. It is rare to see people fighting in a garden. Perhaps struggle unfolds first, not at an economic or social level, but over the appropriation of air, essential to life itself. If human beings can breathe and share air, they don’t need to struggle with one another.
　　　Unfortunately, in our western tradition, neither materialist nor idealist theoreticians give enough consideration to this basic condition for life. As for politicians, despite proposing curbs on environmental pollution, they have not yet called for it to be made a crime. Wealthy countries are even allowed to pollute if they pay for it.
　　　But is our life worth anything other than money? The plant world shows us in silence what faithfulness to life consists of. It also helps us to a new beginning, urging us to care for our breath, not only at a vital but also at a spiritual level. The interdependence to which we must pay the closest attention is that which exists between ourselves and the plant world. Often described as “the lungs of the planet”, the woods that cover the earth offer us the gift of breathable air by releasing oxygen. But their capacity to renew the air polluted by industry has long reached its limit. If we lack the air necessary for a healthy life, it is because we have filled it with chemicals and undercut the ability of plants to regenerate it. As we know, rapid deforestation combined with the massive burning of fossil fuels is an explosive recipe for an irreversible disaster.
　　　The fight over the appropriation of resources will lead the entire planet to hell unless humans learn to share life, both with each other and with plants. This task is simultaneously ethical and political because it can be discharged only when each takes it upon herself or himself and only when it is accomplished together with others. The lesson taught by plants is that sharing life expands and enhances the sphere of the living, while dividing life into so-called natural or human resources diminishes it. We must come to view the air, the plants and ourselves as the contributors to the preservation of life and growth, rather than a web of quantifiable objects or productive potentialities at our disposal. Perhaps then we would finally begin to live, rather than being concerned with bare survival.
61. What does the author assume might be the primary reason that people would struggle with each other?
A) To get their share of clean air             
B) To pursue a comfortable life.             
C) To gain a higher social status.
D) To seek economic benefits.
62. What does the author accuse western politicians of?
A) Depriving common people of the right to clean air.
B) Giving priority to theory rather than practical action.
C) Offering preferential treatment to wealthy countries.
D) Failing to pass laws to curb environmental pollution.
63. What does the author try to draw our closest attention to?
A) The massive burning of fossil fuels.	
B) Our relationship to the plant world.	       
C) The capacity of plants to renew polluted air.
D) Large-scale deforestation across the world.
64. How can human beings accomplish the goal of protecting the plant according to the author?
A) By showing respect for plants.	       
B) By preserving all forms of life.	       
C) By tapping all natural resources.
D) By pooling their efforts together.
65. What does the author suggest we do in order not just to survive?
A) Expand the sphere of living.	       
B) Develop nature’s potentials.	       
C) Share life with nature.
D) Allocate the resources.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Inequality Is Not Inevitable

[A] An dangerous trend has developed over this past third of a century. A country that experienced shared growth after World WarⅡ began to tear apart, so much so that when the Great Recession hit in late 2007, one could no longer ignore the division that had come to define the American economic landscape. How did this “shining city on a hill” become the advanced country with the greatest level of inequality?
[B] Over the past year and a half, The Great Divide, a series in The New York Times, has presented a wide range of examples that undermine the notion that there are any truly fundamental laws of capitalism. The dynamics of the imperial capitalism of the 19th century needn’t apply in the democracies of the 21st. We don’t need to have this much inequality in America.
[C] Our current brand of capitalism is a fake capitalism. For proof of this go back to our response to the Great Recession, where we socialized losses, even as we privatized gains. Perfect competition should drive profits to zero, at least theoretically, but we have monopolies making persistently high profits. C. E. O. s enjoy incomes that are on average 295 times that of the typical worker, a much higher ratio than in the past, without any evidence of a proportionate increase in productivity.
[D] If it is not the cruel laws of economics that have led to America’s great divide, what is it? The straightforward answer: our policies and our politics! People get tired of hearing about Scandinavian success stories, but the fact of the matter is that Sweden, Finland and Norway have all succeeded in having about as much or faster growth in per capita（人均的）incomes than the United States and with far greater equality. 
[E] So why has America chosen these inequality-enhancing policies? Part of the answer is that as World War II faded into memory, so too did the solidarity it had created. As America triumphed in the Cold War, there didn’t seem to be a real competitor to our economic model. Without this international competition, we no longer had to show that our system could deliver for most of our citizens.
[F] Ideology and interests combined viciously. Some drew the wrong lesson from the collapse of the Soviet system in 1991. The pendulum swung from much too much government there to much too little here. Corporate interests argued for getting rid of regulations, even when those regulations had done so much to protect and improve our environment, our safety, our health and the economy itself.
[G] But this ideology was hypocritical（虚伪的）. The bankers, among the strongest advocates of laissez-faire（自由放任的）economics, were only too willing to accept hundreds of billions of dollars from the government in the aid programs that have been a recurring feature of the global economy since the beginning of the Thatcher-Reagan era of “free” markets and deregulation.
[H] The American political system is overrun by money. Economic inequality translates into political inequality, and political inequality yields increasing economic inequality. So corporate welfare increases as we reduce welfare for the poor. Congress maintains subsidies for rich farmers as we cut back on nutritional support for the needy. Drug companies have been given hundreds of billions of dollars as we limit Medicaid benefits. The banks that brought on the global financial crisis got billions while a tiny bit went to the homeowners and victims of the same banks’ predatory（掠夺性的）lending practices. This last decision was particularly foolish. There were alternatives to throwing money at the banks and hoping it would circulate through increased lending.
[I] Our divisions are deep. Economic and geographic segregation has immunized those at the top from the problems of those down below. Like the kings of ancient times, they has come to perceive their privileged positions essentially as a natural right.
[J] Our economy, our democracy and our society have paid for these gross inequalities. The true test of an economy is not how much wealth its princes can accumulate in tax havens（庇护所）,but how well off the typical citizen is. But average incomes are lower than they were a quarter-century ago. Growth has gone to the very, very top, whose share has almost increased four times since 1980. Money that was meant to have trickled（流淌）down has instead evaporated in the agreeable climate of the Cayman Islands.
[K] With almost a quarter of American children younger than 5 living in poverty, and with America doing so little for its poor, the deprivations of one generation are being visited upon the next. Of course, no country has ever come close to providing complete equality of opportunity. But why is America one of the advanced countries where the life prospects of the young are most sharply determined by the income and education of their parents?
[L] Among the most bitter stories in The Great Divide were those that portrayed the frustrations of the young, who long to enter our shrinking middle class. Soaring tuitions and declining incomes have resulted in larger debt burdens. Those with only a high school diploma have seen their incomes decline by 13 percent over the past 35 years.
[M] Where justice is concerned, there is also a huge divide. In the eyes of the rest of the world and a significant part of its own population, mass imprisonment has come to define America—a country, it bears repeating, with about 5 percent of the world’s population but around a fourth of the world’s prisoners.
[N] Justice has become a commodity, affordable to only a few. While Wall Street executives used their expensive lawyers to ensure that their ranks were not held accountable for the misdeeds that the crisis in 2008 so graphically revealed, the banks abused our legal system to foreclose（取消赎回权）on mortgages and eject tenants, some of whom did not even owe money.
[O] More than a half-century ago, America led the way in advocating for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948. Today, access to health care is among the most universally accepted rights, at least in the advanced countries. America, despite the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, is the exception. In the relief that many felt when the Supreme Court did not overturn the Affordable Care Act, the implications of the decision for Medicaid were not fully appreciated. Obamacare’s objective —to ensure that all Americans have access to health care—has been blocked: 24 states have not implemented the expanded Medicaid program, which was the means by which Obamacare was supposed to deliver on its promise to some of the poorest.
[P] We need not just a new war on poverty but a war to protect the middle class. Solutions to these problems do not have to be novel. Far from it. Making markets act like markets would be a good place to start. We must end the rent-seeking society we have gravitated toward, in which the wealthy obtain profits by manipulating the system.
[Q] The problem of inequality is not so much a matter of technical economics. It’s really a problem of practical politics. Inequality is not just about the top marginal tax rate but also about our children’s access to food and the right to justice for all. If we spent more on education, health and infrastructure（基础设施）, we would strengthen our economy, now and in the future.
36.In theory, free competition is supposed to reduce the margin of profits to the minimum.
37.The United States is now characterized by a great division between the rich and the poor.
38.America lacked the incentive to care for the majority of its citizens as it found no rival for its economic model.
39.The wealthy top have come to take privileges for granted.
40.Many examples show the basic laws of imperial capitalism no longer apply in present-day America.
41.The author suggests a return to the true spirit of the market.
42.A quarter of the world’s prisoner population is in America.
43.Government regulation in America went from one extreme to the other in the past two decades.
44.Justice has become so expensive that only a small number of people like corporate executives can afford it.
45.No country in the world so far has been able to provide completely equal opportunities for all.


Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　I’ll admit I’ve never quite understood the obsession（难以破除的成见）surrounding genetically modified (GM) crops. To environmentalist opponents, GM foods are simply evil, an understudied, possibly harmful tool used by big agricultural businesses to control global seed markets and crush local farmers. They argue that GM foods have never delivered on their supposed promise, that money spent on GM crops would be better channeled to organic farming and that consumers should be protected with warning labels on any products that contain genetically modified ingredients. To supporters, GM crops are a key part of the effort to sustainably provide food to meet a growing global population. But more than that, supporters see the GM opposition of many environmentalists as fundamentally anti-science, no different than those who question the basics of man-made climate change.
　　For both sides, GM foods seem to act as a symbol: you’re pro-agricultural business or anti-science. But science is exactly what we need more of when it comes to GM foods, which is why I was happy to see Nature devote a special series of articles to the GM food controversy. The conclusion: while GM crops haven’t yet realized their initial promise and have been dominated by agricultural businesses, there is reason to continue to use and develop them to help meet the enormous challenge of sustainably feeding a growing planet.
　　That doesn’t mean GM crops are perfect, or a one-size-fits-all solution to global agriculture problems. But anything that can increase farming efficiency—the amount of crops we can produce per acre of land—will be extremely useful. GM crops can and almost certainly will be part of that suite of tools, but so will traditional plant breeding, improved soil and crop management—and perhaps most important of all, better storage and transport infrastructure（基础设施）, especially in the developing world. (It doesn’t do much good for farmers in places like sub-Saharan Africa to produce more food if they can’t get it to hungry consumers.) I’d like to see more non-industry research done on GM crops—not just because we’d worry less about bias, but also because seed companies like Monsanto and Pioneer shouldn’t be the only entities working to harness genetic modification. I’d like to see GM research on less commercial crops, like corn. I don’t think it’s vital to label GM ingredients in food, but I also wouldn’t be against it—and industry would be smart to go along with labeling, just as a way of removing fears about the technology.
　　Most of all, though, I wish a tenth of the energy that’s spent endlessly debating GM crops was focused on those more pressing challenges for global agriculture. There are much bigger battles to fight.

46.How do environmentalist opponents view GM foods according to the passage?
　A) They will eventually ruin agriculture and the environment.
　B) They are used by big businesses to monopolize agriculture.
　C) They have proved potentially harmful to consumers’ health.
　D) They pose a tremendous threat to current farming practice.

47.What does the author say is vital to solving the controversy between the two sides of the debate?
　A) Breaking the GM food monopoly.	  
　B) More friendly exchange of ideas.	  
　C) Regulating GM food production.
　D) More scientific research on GM crops.
48.What is the main point of the Nature articles?
　A) Feeding the growing population makes it imperative to develop GM crops.
　B) Popularizing GM technology will help it to live up to its initial promises.
　C) Measures should be taken to ensure the safety of GM foods.
　D) Both supporters and opponents should make compromises.
49.What is the author’s view on the solution to agricultural problems?
　A) It has to depend more and more on GM technology.
　B) It is vital to the sustainable development of human society.
　C) GM crops should be allowed until better alternatives are found.
　D) Whatever is useful to boost farming efficiency should be encouraged.
50.What does the author think of the ongoing debate around GM crops?
　A) It arises out of ignorance of and prejudice against new science.
　B) It distracts the public attention from other key issues of the world.
　C) Efforts spent on it should be turned to more urgent issues of agriculture.
　D) Neither side is likely to give in until more convincing evidence is found.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　Early decision—you apply to one school? and admission is binding—seems like a great choice for nervous applicants. Schools let in a higher percentage of early-decision applicants, which arguably means that you have a better chance of getting in. And if you do, you’re done with the whole agonizing process by December. But what most students and parents don’t realize is that schools have hidden motives for offering early decision.
　　Early decision, since it’s binding, allows schools to fill their classes with qualified students; it allows admissions committees to select the students that are in particular demand for their college and know those students will come. It also gives schools a higher yield rate, which is often used as one of the ways to measure college selectivity and popularity. 
　　The problem is that this process effectively shortens the window of time students have to make one of the most important decisions of their lives up to that point. Under regular admissions, seniors have until May 1 to choose which school to attend early decision effectively steals six months from them, months that could be used to visit more schools, do more research, speak to current students and alumni（校友）and arguably make a more informed decision.
　　There are, frankly, an astonishing number of exceptional colleges in America, and for any given student, there are a number of schools that are a great fit. When students become too fixated（专注）on a particular school early in the admissions process, that fixation can lead to severe disappointment if they don’t get in or, if they do? the possibility that they are now bound to go to a school that, given time for further reflection, may not actually be right for them.
　　Insofar as early decision offers a genuine admissions edge, that advantage goes largely to students who already have numerous advantages. The students who use early decision tend to be those who have received higher-quality college guidance, usually a result of coming from a more privileged background. In this regard, there’s an argument against early decision, as students from lower-income families are far less likely to have the admissions know-how to navigate the often confusing early deadlines.
　　Students who have done their research and are confident that there’s one school they would be thrilled to get into should, under the current system, probably apply under early decision. But for students who haven’t yet done enough research, or who are still constantly changing their minds on favorite schools, the early-decision system needlessly and prematurely narrows the field of possibility just at a time when students should be opening themselves to a whole range of thrilling options.
51.What are students obliged to do under early decision?
　A) Look into a lot of schools before they apply.
　B) Attend the school once they are admitted.
　C) Think twice before they accept the offer.
　D) Consult the current students and alumni.
52.Why do schools offer early decision?
　A) To make sure they get qualified students.
　B) To avoid competition with other colleges.
　C) To provide more opportunities for applicants.
　D) To save students the agony of choosing a school.
53.What is said to be the problem with early decision for students?
　A) It makes their application process more complicated.
　B) It places too high a demand on their research ability.
　C) It allows them little time to make informed decisions.
　D) It exerts much more psychological pressure on them.
54.Why are some people opposed to early decision?
　A) It interferes with students’ learning in high school. 
　B) It is biased against students at ordinary high schools.
　C) It causes unnecessary confusion among college applicants.
　D) It places students from lower-income families at a disadvantage.
55.What does the author advise college applicants to do?
　A) Refrain from competing with students from privileged families.
　B) Avoid choosing early decision unless they are fully prepared.
　C) Find sufficient information about their favorite schools.
　D) Look beyond the few supposedly thrilling options.

　　　On Curiosity
　　　Albert Einstein once said, “I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.” Simple as the remark may sound, it informs us of the significance of curiosity. Actually doing everything curiously is conducive to our development and eventually leads us to success.
　　　For one thing, curiosity is an important source of creativity, which is the key to success. Let’s take Edison as an example. It was curiosity that made him invent so many things and achieved great success in his career. For another, curiosity is the driving force for us to go forward. Curiosity can change boredom into freshness, which will make us acquire new knowledge constantly. Last but not least, curiosity is helpful in resolving difficulties one by one. A person with curiosity is prone to find the essence of the problem and overcome various difficulties.
　　　From what has been mentioned above, curiosity is very important and helpful in personal development. Being enthusiastic about curiosity helps us achieve success sooner or later.

Plastic Surgery
A better credit card is the solution to ever larger hack attacks.
[A] A thin magnetic stripe (magstripe) is all that stands between your credit-card information and the bad guys. And they’ve been working hard to break in. That’s why 2014 is shaping up as a major showdown: banks, law enforcement and technology companies are all trying to stop a network of hackers who are succeeding in stealing account numbers, names, email addresses and other crucial data used in identity theft. More than 100 million accounts at Target, Neiman Marcus and Michaels stores were affected in some way during the most recent attacks, starting last November. 
[B] Swipe（刷卡）is the operative word: cards are increasingly vulnerable to attacks when you make purchases in a store. In several recent incidents, hackers have been able to obtain massive information of credit-debit-(借记)or prepaid-card numbers using malware, i.e. malicious software, inserted secretly into the retailers’ point-of-sale system—the checkout registers. Hackers then sold the data to a second group of criminals operating in shadowy corners of the web. Not long after, the stolen data was showing up on fake cards and being used for online purchases.
[C] The solution could cost as little as $2 extra for every piece of plastic issued. The fix is a security technology used heavily outside the U.S. While American credit cards use the 40-year-old magstripe technology to process transactions, much of the rest of the world uses smarter cards with a technology called EMV (short for Europay, MasterCard, Visa) that employs a chip embedded in the card plus a customer PIN (personal identification number) to authenticate（验证）every transaction on the spot. If a purchaser fails to punch in the correct PIN at the checkout, the transaction gets rejected. (Online purchases can be made by setting up a separate transaction code.
[D] Why haven’t big banks adopted the more secure technology? When it comes to mailing out new credit cards, it’s all about relative costs, says David Robertson, who runs the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. “The cost of the card, putting the sticker on it, coding the account number and expiration date, embossing（凸印）it, the small envelope—all put together, you’re in the dollar range. ” A chip- and-PIN card currently costs closer to $3, says Robertson, because of the price of chips. (Once large issuers convert together, the chip costs should drop.
[E] Multiply $3 by the more than 5 billion magstripe credit and prepaid cards in circulation in the U.S. Then consider that there’s an estimated $12.4 billion in card fraud on a global basis, says Robertson. With 44% of that in the U.S. American credit-card fraud amounts to about $5.5 billion annually. Card issuers have so far calculated that absorbing the liability for even big hacks like the Target one is still cheaper than replacing all that plastic.
[F] That leaves American retailers pretty much alone the world over in relying on magstripe technology to charge purchases—and leaves consumers vulnerable. Each magstripe has three tracks of information, explains payments security expert Jeremy Gumbley, the chief technology officer of Credit Call, an electronic-payments company. The first and third are used by the bank or card issuer. Your vital account information lives on the second track, which hackers try to capture. “Malware is scanning through the memory in real time and looking for data,” he says. “It creates a text file that gets stolen.”
[G] Chip-and-PIN cards, by contrast, make fake cards or skimming impossible because the information that gets scanned is encrypted（加密）. The historical reason the U.S. has stuck with magstripe, ironically enough, is once superior technology. Our cheap, ultra-reliable wired networks made credit- card authentication over the phone frictionless. In France, card companies created EMV in part because the telephone monopoly was so maddeningly inefficient and expensive. The EMV solution allowed transactions to be verified locally and securely.
[H] Some big banks, like Wells Fargo, are now offering to convert your magstripe card to a chip-and-PIN model. (It’s actually a hybrid（混合体）that will still have a magstripe, since most U.S. merchants don’t have EMV terminals.) Should you take them up on it? If you travel internationally, the answer is yes.
[I] Keep in mind, too, that credit cards typically have better liability protection than debit cards. If someone uses your credit card fraudulently（欺诈性的），it’s the issuer or merchant, not you, that takes the hit. Debit cards have different liability limits depending on the bank and the events surrounding any fraud. “If it’s available, the logical thing is to get a chip-and-PIN card from your bank,” says Eric Adamowsky, a co-founder of Credit Cardlnsider.com. “I would use credit cards over debit cards because of liability issues.” Cash still works pretty well too.
[J] Retailers and banks stand to benefit from the lower fraud levels of chip-and-PIN cards but have been reluctant for years to invest in the new infrastructure （基础设施）needed for the technology, especially if consumers don’t have access to it. It’s a chicken-and-egg problem: no one wants to spend the money on upgraded point-of-sale systems that can read the chip cards if shoppers aren’t carrying them—yet there’s little point in consumers’ carrying the fancy plastic if stores aren’t equipped to use them. (An earlier effort by Target to move to chip and PIN never gained progress.) According to Gumbley, there’s a “you-first mentality. The logjam（僵局）has to be broken.”
[K] JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently expressed his willingness to do so, noting that banks and merchants have spent the past decade suing each other over interchange fees—the percentage of the transaction price they keep—rather than deal with the growing hacking problem. Chase offers a chip- enabled card under its own brand and several others for travel-related companies such as British Airways and Ritz-Carlton.
[L] The Target and Neiman hacks have also changed the cost calculation: although retailers have been reluctant to spend the $6.75 billion that Capgemini consultants estimate it will take to convert all their registers to be chip-and-PIN-compatible, the potential liability they now face is dramatically greater. Target has been hit with class actions from hacked consumers. “It’s the ultimate nightmare,” a retail executive from a well-known chain admitted to TIME.
[M] The card-payment companies MasterCard and Visa are pushing hard for change. The two firms have warned all parties in the transaction chain—merchant, network, bank—that if they don’t become EMV-compliant by October 2015, the party that is least compliant will bear the fraud risk.
[N] In the meantime, app-equipped smartphones and digital wallets—all of which can use EMV technology—are beginning to make inroads（侵染）on cards and cash. PayPal, for instance, is testing an app that lets you use your mobile phone to pay on the fly at local merchants—without surrendering any card information to them. And further down the road is biometric authentication, which could be encrypted with, say, a fingerprint.
[O] Credit and debit cards, though, are going to be with us for the foreseeable future, and so are hackers, if we stick with magstripe technology. “It seems crazy to me,” says Gumbley, who is English, “that a cutting-edge-technology country is depending on a 40-year-old technology.” That’s why it may be up to consumers to move the needle on chip and PIN. Says Robertson: “	When you get the consumer into a position of worry and inconvenience, that’s where the rubber hits the road.”
36. It is best to use an EMV card for international travel.
37. Personal information on credit and debit cards is increasingly vulnerable to hacking.
38. The French card companies adopted EMV technology partly because of inefficient telephone service.
39. While many countries use the smarter EMV cards, the U.S. still clings to its old magstripe technology.
40. Attempts are being made to prevent hackers from carrying out identity theft.
41. Credit cards are much safer to use than debit cards.
42. Big banks have been reluctant to switch to more secure technology because of the higher costs involved.
43. The potential liability for retailers using magstripe is far more costly than upgrading their registers.
44. The use of magstripe cards by American retailers leaves consumers exposed to the risks of losing account information.
45. Consumers will be a driving force behind the conversion from magstripe to EMV technology.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　What’s the one word of advice a well-meaning professional would give to a recent college graduate? China? India? Brazil? How about trade?
　　When the Commerce Department reported last week that the trade deficit in June approached $50 billion, it set off a new round of economic doomsaying. Imports, which soared to $200.3 billion in the month, are subtracted in the calculation of gross domestic product. The larger the trade deficit,the smaller the GDP. Should such imbalances continue, pessimists say, they could contribute to slower growth.
　　But there's another way of looking at the trade data.Over the past two years, the figures on imports and exports seem not to signal a double-dip recession--a renewed decline in the broad level of economic activity in the United States-but an economic expansion.
　　The rising volume of trade—more goods and services shuttling in and out of the United States—is good news for many sectors. Companies engaged in shipping, trucking,rail freight,delivery, and logistics(物流) have all been reporting better than expected results. The rising numbers signify growing vitality in foreign market—when we import more stuff, it puts more cash in the hands of people around the world, and U.S. exports are rising because more foreigners have the ability to buy the things we produce and market. The rising tide of trade is also good news for people who work in trade-sensitive businesses, especially those that produce commodities for which global demand sets the price-agricultural goods, mining, metals, oil.
　　And while exports always seem to lag, U.S. companies are becoming more involved in the global economy with each passing month.General Motors sells as many cars in China as in America each month. While that may not do much for imports, it does help GM's balance sheet—and hence makes the jobs of U.S.-based executives more stable.
　　One great challenge for the U.S. economy is slack domestic consumer demand.Americans are paying down debt, saving more, and spending more carefully. That's to be expected, given what we've been through. But there’s a bigger challenge. Can U.S.-based businesses,large and small, figure out how to get a piece of growing global demand? Unless you want to pick up and move to India, or Brazil, or China, the best way to do that is through trade. It may seem obvious, but it's no longer enough simply to do business with our friends and neighbors here at home.
　　Companies and individuals who don't have a strategy to export more,or to get more involved in foreign markets, or to play a role in global trade, are shutting themselves out of the lion’s share of economic opportunity in our world.
46. How do pessimists interpret the U,S. trade deficit in June?
A) It reflects Americans' preference for imported goods.
B ) It signifies a change in American economic structure.
C) It could lead to slower growth of the national economy.
D) It is the result of America's growing focus on domestic market.
47. What does the author say about the trade data of the past two years?
A) It indicates that economic activities in the U.S. have increased.
B) It signals decreasing domestic demand for goods and services.
C) It reflects the fluctuations in the international market.
D) It shows that U.S. economy is slipping further into recession.
48. Who particularly benefit from the rising volume of trade?
A) People who have expertise in international trade. 
C) Producers of agricultural goods and raw materials.
B) Consumers who favor imported goods and services.
D) Retailers dealing in foreign goods and services.
49. What is one of the challenges facing the American economy?
A) Decreasing productivity.
B) Competition from overseas.
C) People's reluctance to spend.
D ) Slack trade activities.
50. What is the author's advice to U.S. companies and individuals?
A) To import more cheap goods from developing countries.
B ) To increase their market share overseas.
C) To be alert to fluctuations in foreign markets.
D) To move their companies to where labor is cheaper.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　A recurring criticism of the UK's university sector is its perceived weakness in translating new knowledge into new products and services.
　　Recently, the UK National Stem Cell Network warned the UK could lose its place among the world leaders in stem cell research unless adequate funding and legislation could be assured.We should take this concern seriously as universities are key in the national innovation system.
　　However, we do have to challenge the unthinking complaint that the sector does not do enough in taking ideas to market.The most recent comparative data on the performance of universities and research institutions in Australia, Canada,USA and UK shows that, from a relatively weak starting position, the UK now leads on many indicators of commercialisation activity.
　　When viewed at the national level, the policy interventions of the past decade have helped transform the performance of U.K. universities.Evidence suggests the UK’s position is much stronger than in the recent past and is still showing improvement.But national data masks the very large variation in the performance of individual universities. The evidence shows that a large number of universities have fallen off the back of the pack, a few perform strongly and the rest chase the leaders.
　　This type of uneven distribution is not peculiar to the U.K. and is mirrored across other economies. In the UK, research is concentrated: less than 25% of universities receive 75% of the research funding. These same universities are also the institutions producing the greatest share of PhD graduate, science citations, patents and licence income. The effect of policies generating long-term resource concentration has also created a distinctive set of universities which are research-led and commercially active. It seems clear that the concentration of research and commercialisation work creates differences between universities.
　　The core objective for universities which are research-led must be to maximise the impact of their research efforts. These universities should be generating the widest range of social, economic and environmental benefits. In return for the scale. of investment,they should share their expertise in order to build greater confidence in the sector.
　　Part of the economic recovery of the UK will be driven by the next generation of research commercialisations pilling out of our universities. There are three dozen universities in the UK which are actively engaged in advanced research training and commercialisation work.
　　If there was a greater coordination of technology transfer offices within regions and a simultaneous investment in the scale and functions of our graduate schools, universities could, and should, play a key role in positioning the U.K. for the next growth cycle.
51. What does the author think of UK universities in terms of commercialisation?
A)They still have a place among the world leaders.  
C) They do not regard it as their responsibility.
B) They have lost their leading position in many ways.
D) They fail to convert knowledge into money.
52. What does the author say about the national data on UK universities’ performance in commercialisation?
A) It masks the fatal weaknesses of government policy.
B) It does not reflect the differences among universities.
C) It does not rank UK universities in a scientific way.
D) It indicates their ineffective use of government resources.
53. We can infer from Paragraph 5 that “policy interventions”(Line 1, Para. 4) refers to    .
A) concentration of resources in a limited number of universities
B) compulsory cooperation between universities and industries
C) government aid to non-research-oriented universities
D) fair distribution of funding for universities and research institutions
54. What does the author suggest research-led universities do?
A)Fully utilise their research to benefit all sectors of society.
B) Generously share their facilities with those short of funds.
C) Publicise their research to win international recognition.
D) Spread their influence among top research institutions.
55.How can the university sector play a key role in the UK’s economic growth?
A) By establishing more regional technology transfer offices.
B) By asking the government to invest in technology transfer research.
C) By promoting technology transfer and graduate school education.
D) By increasing the efficiency of technology transfer agencies.

Part Ⅲ        Reading Comprehension        (40 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　According to a report from the Harvard School of Public Health, many everyday products, including some bug sprays and cleaning fluids, could lead to an increased risk of brain and behavioral disorders in children. The developing brain, the report says, is particularly __26__ to the toxic effects of certain chemicals these products may contain, and the damage they cause can be __27__ .
　　The official policy, however, is still evolving. Health and environmental __28__ have long urged US government agencies to __29__ the use of some of the 11 chemicals the report cites and called for more studies on their long-term effects. In 2001, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency   30   the type and amount of lead that could be present in paint and soil in homes and child-care   31   , after concerns were raised about lead poisoning. The agency is now _32__ the toxic effects of some of the chemicals in the latest report.
　　But the threshold for regulation is high. Because children’s brain and behavioral disorders, like hyperactivity and lower grades, can also be linked to social and genetic factors? It’s tough to pin them on exposure to specific chemicals with solid __33__ evidence, which is what the EPA requires. Even the Harvard study did not prove a direct  34   but noted strong associations between exposure and risk of behavioral issues.
　　Nonetheless, it’s smart to __35__ caution. While it may be impossible to prevent kids from drinking tap water that may contain trace amounts of chemicals, keeping kids away from lawns recently sprayed with chemicals and freshly dry-cleaned clothes can’t hurt.

The Impossibility of Rapid Energy Transitions

[A] Politicians are fond of promising rapid energy transitions. Whether it is a transition from imported to domestic oil or from coal-powered electricity production to natural-gas power plants, politicians love to talk big. Unfortunately for them (and often the taxpayers), our energy systems are a bit like an aircraft carrier: they are unbelievably expensive, they are built to last for a very long time, they have a huge amount of inertia (meaning it takes a lot of energy to set them moving), and they have a lot of momentum once they are set in motion. No matter how hard you try, you can’t turn something that large on a dime (10美分硬币), or even a few thousand dimes.
[B] In physics, moving objects have two characteristics relevant to understanding the dynamics of energy systems: inertia and momentum. Inertia is the resistance of objects to efforts to change their state of motion. If you try to push a boulder（大圆石）, it pushes you back. Once you have started the boulder rolling, it develops momentum, which is defined by its mass and velocity. Momentum is said to be “conserved,” that is, once you build it up, it has to go somewhere. So a heavy object, like a football player moving at a high speed, has a lot of momentum—that is, once he is moving, it is hard to change his state of motion. If you want to change his course, you have only a few choices: you can stop him, transferring (possibly painfully) some of his kinetic energy（动能）to your own body, or you can approach alongside and slowly apply pressure to gradually alter his course.
[C] But there are other kinds of momentum as well. After all, we don’t speak only of objects or people as having momentum; we speak of entire systems having momentum. Whether it’s a sports team or a presidential campaign, everybody relishes having the big momentum, because it makes them harder to stop or change direction.
[D] One kind of momentum is technological momentum. When a technology is deployed, its impacts reach far beyond itself. Consider the incandescent（白炽灯的）bulb, an object currently hated by many environmentalists and energy-efficiency advocates. The incandescent light bulb, invented by Thomas Edison, which came to be the symbol of inspiration, has been developed into hundreds, if not thousands, of forms. Today, a visit to a lighting store reveals a stunning array of choices. There are standard-shaped bulbs, flame-shaped bulbs, colored globe-shaped bulbs, and more. It is quite easy, with all that choice, to change a light bulb.
[E] But the momentum of incandescent lighting does not stop there. All of those specialized bulbs led to the building of specialized light fixtures, from the desk lamp you study by, to the ugly but beloved hand-painted Chinese lamp you inherited from your grandmother, to the ceiling fixture in your closet, to the light in your oven or refrigerator, and to the light that the dentist points at you. It is easy to change a light bulb, sure, but it is harder to change the bulb and its fixture.
[F] And there is more to the story, because not only are the devices that house incandescent bulbs shaped to their underlying characteristics, but rooms and entire buildings have been designed in accordance with how incandescent lighting reflects off walls and windows.
[G] As lighting expert Howard Brandston points out, “Generally, there are no bad light sources, only bad applications.” There are some very commendable characteristics of the CFL [compact fluorescent（荧光的）light bulb], yet the selection of any light source remains inseparable from the luminaire（照明装置）that houses it, along with the space in which both are installed, and lighting requirements that need to be satisfied. The lamp, the fixture, and the room, all three must work in concert and for the true benefits of end-users. If the CFL should be used for lighting a particular space, or an object within that space, the fixture must be designed to work with that lamp, and that fixture with the room. It is a symbiotic（共生的）relationship. A CFL cannot be simply installed in an incandescent fixture and then expected to produce a visual appearance that is more than washed out, foggy, and dim. The whole fixture must be replaced—light source and luminaire—and this is never an inexpensive proposition.
[H] And Brandston knows a thing or two about lighting, being the man who illuminated the Statue of Liberty.
[I] Another type of momentum we have to think about when planning for changes in our energy systems is labor-pool momentum. It is one thing to say that we are going to shift 30 percent of our electricity supply from, say, coal to nuclear power in 20 years. But it is another thing to have a supply of trained talent that could let you carry out this promise. That is because the engineers, designers, regulators, operators, and all of the other skilled people needed for the new energy industry are specialists who have to be trained first (or retrained, if they are the ones being laid off in some related industry), and education, like any other complicated endeavor, takes time. And not only do our prospective new energy workers have to be trained, they have to be trained in the right sequence. One needs the designers, and perhaps the regulators, before the builders and operators, and each group of workers in training has to know there is work waiting beyond graduation. In some cases, colleges and universities might have to change their training programs, adding another layer of difficulty.
[J] By far the biggest type of momentum that comes into play when it comes to changing our energy systems is economic momentum. The major components of our energy systems, such as fuel production, refining, electrical generation and distribution, are costly installations that have lengthy life spans. They have to operate for long periods of time before the costs of development have been recovered. When investors put up money to build, say, a nuclear power plant, they expect to earn that money back over the planned life of the plant, which is typically between 40 and 60 years. Some coal power plants in the United States have operated for more than 70 years! The oldest continuously operated commercial hydro-electric plant in the United States is on New York’s Hudson River, and it went into commercial service in 1898.
[K] As Vaclav Smil points out, “All the forecasts, plans, and anticipations cited above have failed so miserably because their authors and promoters thought the transitions they hoped to implement would proceed unlike all previous energy transitions, and that their progress could be accelerated in an unprecedented manner.”
[L] When you hear people speaking of making a rapid transition toward any type of energy, whether it is a switch from coal to nuclear power, or a switch from gasoline-powered cars to electric cars, or even a switch from an incandescent to a fluorescent light, understanding energy system inertia and momentum can help you decide whether their plans are feasible.
36. Not only moving objects and people but all systems have momentum.
37. Changing the current energy system requires the systematic training of professionals and skilled labor.
38. Changing a light bulb is easier than changing the fixture housing it.
39. Efforts to accelerate the current energy transitions didn’t succeed as expected.
40. To change the light source is costly because you have to change the whole fixture.
41. Energy systems, like an aircraft carrier set in motion, have huge momentum.
42. The problem with lighting, if it arises, often doesn’t lie in light sources but in their applications.
43. The biggest obstacle to energy transition is that the present energy system is too expensive to replace.
54. The application of a technology can impact areas beyond itself.
55. Physical characteristics of moving objects help explain the dynamics of energy systems.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　One hundred years ago, “Colored” was the typical way of referring to Americans of African descent. Twenty years later, it was purposefully dropped to make way for “Negro.” By the late 1960s, that term was overtaken by “Black.” And then, at a press conference in Chicago in 1988, Jesse Jackson declared that “African American” was the term to embrace. This one was chosen because it echoed the labels of groups, such as “Italian Americans” and “Irish Americans,” that had already been freed of widespread discrimination.
　　A century’s worth of calculated name changes point to the fact that naming any group is a politically freighted exercise. A 2001 study cataloged all the ways in which the term “Black” carried connotations（涵义）that were more negative than those of “African American.”
　　But if it was known that “Black” people were viewed differently from “African Americans,” researchers, until now, hadn’t identified what that gap in perception was derived from. A recent study, conducted by Emory University’s Erika Hall, found that “Black” people are viewed more negatively than “African Americans” because of a perceived difference in socioeconomic status. As a result, “Black” people are thought of as less competent and as having colder personalities.
　　The study’s most striking findings shed light on the racial biases permeating the professional world. Even seemingly harmless details on a resume, it appears, can tap into recruiters’ biases. A job application might mention affiliations with groups such as the “Wisconsin Association of African-American Lawyers” or the “National Black Employees Association,” the names of which apparently have consequences, and are also beyond their members’ control.
　　In one of the study’s experiments, subjects were given a brief description of a man from Chicago with the last name Williams. To one group, he was identified as “African-American,” and another was told he was “Black.” With little else to go on, they were asked to estimate Mr. Williams’s salary, professional standing, and educational background.
　　The “African-American” group estimated that he earned about $37,000 a year and had a two-year college degree. The “Black” group, on the other hand, put his salary at about $29,000, and guessed that he had only “some” college experience. Nearly three-quarters of the first group guessed that Mr. Williams worked at a managerial level, while only 38.5 percent of the second group thought so.
　　Hall’s findings suggest there’s an argument to be made for electing to use “African American,” though one can’t help but get the sense that it’s a decision that papers over the urgency of continued progress. Perhaps a new phrase is needed, one that can bring everyone one big step closer to realizing Du Bois’s original, idealistic hope: “It’s not the name—it’s the Thing that counts.”
46. Why did Jesse Jackson embrace the term “African American” for people of African descent?
　A) It is free from racial biases.	         
　B) It represents social progress.	             
　C) It is in the interest of common Americans.
　D) It follows the standard naming practice.
47. What does the author say about the naming of an ethnic group?
　A) It advances with the times.	        C) It merits intensive study.
　B) It is based on racial roots.	        D) It is politically sensitive.
48. What do Erika Hall’s findings indicate?
　A) Racial biases are widespread in the professional world.
　B) Many applicants don’t attend to details on their resumes.
　C) Job seekers should all be careful about their affiliations.
　D) Most recruiters are unable to control their racial biases.
49. What does Erika Hall find in her experiment about a man with the last name Williams?
　A) African Americans fare better than many other ethnic groups.
　B) Black people’s socioeconomic status in America remains low.
　C) People’s conception of a person has much to do with the way he or she is labeled.
　D) One’s professional standing and income are related to their educational background.
50. What is Dr. Du Bois’s ideal?
　A) All Americans enjoy equal rights.
　B) A person is judged by their worth.
　C) A new term is created to address African Americans.
　D) All ethnic groups share the nation’s continued progress.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　Across the board, American colleges and universities are not doing a very good job of preparing their students for the workplace or their post-graduation lives. This was made clear by the work of two sociologists, Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa. In 2011 they released a landmark study titled “Academically Adrift,” which documented the lack of intellectual growth experienced by many people enrolled in college. In particular, Arum and Roksa found, college students were not developing the critical thinking, analytic reasoning and other higher-level skills that are necessary to thrive in today’s knowledge-based economy and to lead our nation in a time of complex challenges and dynamic change.
　　Arum and Roksa placed the blame for students’ lack of learning on a watered-down college curriculum and lowered undergraduate work standards. Although going to college is supposed to be a full-time job, students spent, on average, only 12 to 14 hours a week studying and many were skating through their semesters without doing a significant amount of reading and writing. Students who take more challenging classes and spend more time studying do learn more. But the priorities of many undergraduates are with extracurricular activities, playing sports, and partying and socializing.
　　Laura Hamilton, the author of a study on parents who pay for college, will argue in a forthcoming book that college administrations are overly concerned with the social and athletic activities of their students. In Paying for the Party, Hamilton describes what she calls the “party pathway,” which eases many students through college, helped along by various clubs that send students into the party scene and a host of easier majors. By sanctioning this water-down version of college, universities are “catering to the social and educational needs of wealthy students at the expense of others” who won’t enjoy the financial backing or social connections of richer students once they graduate.
　　These students need to build skills and knowledge during college if they are to use their degrees as a stepping-stone to middle-class mobility. But more privileged students must not waste this opportunity either. As recent graduates can testify, the job market isn’t kind to candidate who can’t demonstrate genuine competence, along with a well-cultivated willingness to work hard. Nor is the global economy forgiving of an American workforce with increasingly weak literacy, math and science abilities. College graduates will still fare better than those with only a high school education, of course. But a university degree unaccompanied by a gain in knowledge or skills is an empty achievement indeed. For students who have been coasting through college, and for American universities that have been demanding less work, offering more attractions and charging higher tuition, the party may soon be over.
61. What is Arum and Roksa’s finding about higher education in America?
　A) It aims at stimulating the intellectual curiosity of college students.
　B) It fails to prepare students to face the challenges of modern times.
　C) It has experienced dramatic changes in recent years.
　D) It has tried hard to satisfy students’ various needs.
62. What is responsible for the students’ lack of higher-level skills?
　A) The diluted college curriculum.	  C) The absence of rigorous discipline.
　B) The boring classroom activities.	  D) The outdated educational approach.
63. What does Laura Hamilton say about college administrations?
　A) They fail to give adequate help to the needy students.
　B) They tend to offer too many less challenging courses.
　C) They seem to be out of touch with society.
　D) They prioritize non-academic activities.
64. What can be learned about the socially and financially privileged students?
　A) They tend to have a sense of superiority over their peers.
　B) They can afford to choose easier majors in order to enjoy themselves.
　C) They spend a lot of time building strong connections with businesses.
　D) They can climb the social ladder even without a degree.
65. What does the author suggest in the last paragraph?
　A) American higher education has lost its global competitiveness.
　B) People should not expect too much from American higher education.
　C) The current situation in American higher education may not last long.
　D) It will take a long time to change the current trend in higher education.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
First-Generation College-Goers: Unprepared and Behind

Kids who are the first in their families to brave the world of higher education come on campus with little academic know-how and are much more likely than their peers to drop out before graduation.
[A] When Nijay Williams entered college last fall as a first-generation student and Jamaican immigrant, he was academically unprepared for the rigors of higher education. Like many first-generation students, he enrolled in a medium-sized state university many of his high school peers were also attending, received a Pell Grant, and took out some small federal loans to cover other costs. Given the high price of room and board and the closeness of the school to his family, he chose to live at home and worked between 30 and 40 hours a week while taking a full class schedule.
[B] What Nijay didn’t realize about his school—Tennessee State University—was its frighteningly low graduation rate a mere 29 percent for its first-generation students. At the end of his first year, Nijay lost his Pell Grant of over $ 5,000 after narrowly missing the 2.0 GPA cut-off, making it impossible for him to continue paying for school.
[C] Nijay represents a large and growing group of Americans: first-generation college students who enter school unprepared or behind. To make matters worse, these schools are ill-equipped to graduate these students—young adults who face specific challenges and obstacles. They typically carry financial burdens that outweigh those of their peers, are more likely to work while attending school, and often require significant academic remediation（补习）.
[D] Matt Rubinoff directs I’m First, a nonprofit organization launched last October to reach out to this specific population of students. He hopes to distribute this information and help prospective college- goers find the best post-secondary fit. And while Rubinoff believes there are a good number of four-year schools that truly care about these students and set aside significant resources and programs for them, he says that number isn’t high enough.
[E] “It’s not only the selective and elite institutions that provide those opportunities for a small subset of this population,” Rubinoff said, adding that a majority of first-generation undergraduates tend toward options such as online programs, two-year colleges, and commuter state schools. “Unfortunately, there tends to be a lack of information and support to help students think bigger and broader.” 
[F] Despite this problem, many students are still drawn to these institutions—and two-year schools in particular. As a former high school teacher, I saw students choose familiar, cheaper options year after year. Instead of skipping out on higher education altogether, they chose community colleges or state schools with low bars for admittance.
[G] “They underestimate themselves when selecting a university,” said Dave Jarrat, a marketing executive for Inside Track, a for-profit organization that specializes in coaching low-income students and supporting colleges in order to help students thrive. “The reality of it is that a lot of low-income kids could be going to elite universities on a full ride scholarship and don’t even realize it.”
[H] “Many students are coming from a situation where no one around them has the experience of successfully completing higher education, so they are coming in questioning themselves and their college worthiness,” Jarrat continued. That helps explain why, as I’m First’s Rubinoff indicated, the schools to which these students end up resorting can end up being some of the poorest matches for them. The University of Tennessee in Knoxville offers one example of this dilemma. A flagship university in the South, the school graduates just 16 percent of its first-generation students, despite its overall graduation rate of 71 percent. Located only a few hours apart, The University of Tennessee and Tennessee State are worth comparing. Tennessee State’s overall graduation rate is a tiny 39 percent, but at least it has a smaller gap between the outcomes for first-generation students and those of their peers.
[I] Still, the University of Tennessee deserves credit for being transparent. Many large institutions keep this kind of data secret—or at least make it incredibly difficult to find. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, for instance, admits only that the graduation rate for its first-generation pupils is “much lower” than the percentage of all students who graduate within four years (81 percent).
[J] It is actually quite difficult to find reliable statistics on the issue for many schools. Higher education institutions are, under federal law, required to report graduation rates, but these reports typically only include Pell recipient numbers—not necessarily rates specific to first-generation students. Other initiatives fail to break down the data, too. Imagine how intimidating it can be for prospective students unfamiliar with the complexities of higher education to navigate this kind of information and then identify which schools are the best fit.
[K] It was this lack of information that prompted the launch of I’m First in 2013, originally as an arm of its umbrella organization, the Center For Student Opportunity. “If we can help to direct students to more of these types of campuses and help students to understand them to be realistic and accessible places, have them apply to these schools at greater frequency and ultimately get in and enroll, we are going to raise the success rate,” Rubinoff said, citing a variety of colleges ranging from large state institutions to smaller private schools.
[L] Chelsea Jones, who now directs student programming at I’m First, was a first-generation college student at Howard. Like other students new to the intimidating higher-education world, she often struggled on her path to college, “There wasn’t really a college-bound culture at my high school,” she said. “I wanted to go to college but I didn’t really know the process.” Jones became involved with a college-access program through Princeton University in high school. Now, she attributes much of her understanding of college to that: “But once I got to campus, it was a completely different ball game that no one really prepared me for.”
[M] She was fortunate, though. Howard, a well-regarded historically black college, had an array of resources for its first-generation students, including matching kids with counselors, connecting first-generation students to one another, and TRIO, a national program that supported 200 students on Howard’s campus. Still, Jones represents a small percentage of first-generation students who are able to gain entry into more elite universities, which are often known for robust financial aid packages and remarkably high graduation rates for first-generation students. (Harvard, for example, boasts a six- year graduation rate for underrepresented minority groups of 98 percent.
[N] Christian Vazquez, a first-generation Yale graduate, is another exception, his success story setting him far apart from students such as Nijay. “There is a lot of support at Yale, to an extent, after a while, there is too much support,” he said, half-joking about the countless resources available at the school. Students are placed in small groups with counselors (trained seniors on campus); they have access to cultural and ethnic affinity（联系）groups, tutoring centers and also have a summer orientation specifically for first-generation students (the latter being one of the most common programs for students).
[O] “Our support structure was more like: ‘You are going to get through Yale; you are going to do well,’” he said, hinting at mentors（导师）, staff, and professors who all provided significant support for students who lacked confidence about “belonging” at such a top institution.

36. Many first-generation college-goers have doubts about their abilities to get a college degree.
37. First-generation college students tend to have much heavier financial burdens than their peers.
38. The graduation rate of first-generation students at Nijay’s university was incredibly low.
39. Some top institutions like Yale seem to provide first-generation students with more support than they actually need.
40. On entering college, Nijay Williams had no idea how challenging college education was.
41. Many universities simply refuse to release their exact graduation rates for first-generation students.
42. According to a marketing executive, many students from low-income families don’t know they could have a chance of going to an elite university.
43. Some elite universities attach great importance to building up the first-generation students, self-confidence.
44. I’m First distributes information to help first-generation college-goers find schools that are most suitable for them.
45. Elite universities tend to graduate first-generation students at a higher rate.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　Saying they can no longer ignore the rising price of health care, some of the most influential medical groups in the nation are recommending that doctors weigh the costs, not just the effectiveness of treatments, as they make decisions about patient care.
　　The shift, little noticed outside the medical establishment but already controversial inside it, suggests that doctors are starting to redefine their roles, from being concerned exclusively about individual patients to exerting influence on how healthcare dollars are spent.
　　In practical terms, the new guidelines being developed could result in doctors choosing one drug over another for cost reasons or even deciding that a particular treatment—at the end of life, for example—is too expensive. In the extreme, some critics have said that making treatment decisions based on cost is a form of rationing.
　　Traditionally, guidelines have heavily influenced the practice of medicine, and the latest ones are expected to make doctors more conscious of the economic consequences of their decisions, even though there’s no obligation to follow them. Medical society guidelines are also used by insurance companies to help determine reimbursement（报销）policies.
　　Some doctors see a potential conflict in trying to be both providers of patient care and financial overseers. “There should be forces in society who should be concerned about the budget, but they shouldn’t be functioning simultaneously as doctors,” said Dr. Martin Samuels at a Boston hospital. He said doctors risked losing the trust of patients if they told patients, “I’m not going to do what I think is best for you because I think it’s bad for the healthcare budget in Massachusetts.”
　　Doctors can face some grim trade-offs. Studies have shown, for example, that two drugs are about equally effective in treating macular degeneration, an eye disease. But one costs $50 a dose and the other close to $2,000. Medicare could save hundreds of millions of dollars a year if everyone used the cheaper drug, Avastin, instead of the costlier one, Lucentis.
　　But the Food and Drug Administration has not approved Avastin for use in the eye, and using it rather than the alternative, Lucentis, might carry an additional, although slight, safety risk. Should doctors consider Medicare’s budget in deciding what to use?
　　“I think ethically（在道德层面上）we are just worried about the patient in front of us and not trying to save money for the insurance industry or society as a whole,” said Dr. Donald Jensen.
　　Still, some analysts say that there’s a role for doctors to play in cost analysis because not many others are doing so. “In some ways,” said Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, “it represents a failure of wider society to take up the issue.” 
46. What do some most influential medical groups recommend doctors do?
　A) Reflect on the responsibilities they are supposed to take.
　B) Pay more attention to the effectiveness of their treatments.
　C) Take costs into account when making treatment decisions.
　D) Readjust their practice in view of the cuts in health care.
47. What were doctors mainly concerned about in the past?
　A) Specific medicines to be used.	   C) Professional advancement.
　B) Effects of medical treatment.	   D) Patients’ trust.
48. What may the new guidelines being developed lead to?
　A) The redefining of doctors’ roles.	    C) Conflicts between doctors and patients.
　B) Overuse of less effective medicines.	    D) The prolonging of patients’ suffering.
49. What risk do doctors see in their dual role as patient care providers and financial overseers?
　A) They may be involved in a conflict of interest.
　B) They may be forced to divide their attention.
　C) They may have to use less effective drugs.
　D) They may lose the respect of patients.
50. What do some experts say about doctors’ involvement in medical cost analysis?
　A) It may add to doctors’ already heavy workloads.
　B) It will help to save money for society as a whole.
　C) It results from society’s failure to tackle the problem.
　D) It raises doctors’ awareness of their social responsibilities.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　Economic inequality is the “defining challenge of our time,” President Barack Obama declared in a speech last month to the Center for American Progress. Inequality is dangerous, he argued, not merely because it doesn’t look good to have a large gap between the rich and the poor, but because inequality itself destroys upward mobility, making it harder for the poor to escape from poverty. “Increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American Dream,” he said.
　　Obama is only the most prominent public figure to declare inequality Public Enemy No.1 and the greatest threat to reducing poverty in America. A number of prominent economists have also argued that it’s harder for the poor to climb the economic ladder today because the rungs（横档）in that ladder have grown farther apart.
　　For all the new attention devoted to the 1 percent, a new dataset from the Equality of Opportunity Project at Harvard and Berkeley suggests that, if we care about upward mobility overall, we’re vastly exaggerating the dangers of the rich-poor gap. Inequality itself is not a particularly strong predictor of economic mobility, as sociologist Scott Winship noted in a recent article based on his analysis of this data.
　　So what factors, at the community level, do predict if poor children will move up the economic ladder as adults? What explains, for instance, why the Salt Lake City metro area is one of the 100 largest metropolitan areas most likely to lift the fortunes of the poor and the Atlanta metro area is one of the least likely?
　　Harvard economist Raj Chetty has pointed to economic and racial segregation, community density, the size of a community’s middle class, the quality of schools, community religiosity, and family structure, which he calls the “single strongest correlate of upward mobility.” Chetty finds that communities like Salt Lake City, with high levels of two-parent families and religiosity, are much more likely to see poor children get ahead than communities like Atlanta, with high levels of racial and economic segregation.
　　Chetty has not yet issued a comprehensive analysis of the relative predictive power of each of these factors. Based on my analyses of the data, of the factors that Chetty has highlighted, the following three seem to be most predictive of upward mobility in a given community:
　1. Per-capita（人均）income growth
　2. Prevalence of single mothers (where correlation is strong, but negative
　3. Per-capita local government spending
　In other words, communities with high levels of per-capita income growth, high percentages of two-parent families, and high local government spending—which may stand for good schools—are the most likely to help poor children relive the Horatio Alger’s rags-to-riches story.
51. How does Obama view economic inequality?
A) It is the biggest obstacle to social mobility.
B) It is the greatest threat to social stability.
C) It is the No. 1 enemy of income growth.
D) It is the most malicious social evil of our time.
52. What do we learn about the inequality gap from Scott Winship’s data analysis?
A) It is fast widening across most parts of America.
B) It is not a reliable indicator of economic mobility.
C) It is not correctly interpreted.
D) It is overwhelmingly ignored.
53. Compared with Atlanta, metropolitan Salt Lake City is said to _______.
A) have placed religious beliefs above party politics
B) have bridged the gap between the rich and the poor
C) offer poor children more chances to climb the social ladder
D) suffer from higher levels of racial and economic segregation
54. What is strongly correlated with social mobility according to economist Raj Chetty?
A) Family structure. 	         C) School education.
B) Racial equality.  	         D) Community density.
55. What does the author seem to suggest?
A) It is important to increase the size of the middle class.
B) It is highly important to expand the metropolitan areas.
C) It is most imperative to focus our efforts on the elimination of income inequality.
D) It is better to start from the community to help poor children move up the social ladder.

　　　The Impact of Social Networking Websites on Reading
　　　As we can see from the picture, a pair of lovers is discussing about reading. To our amusement, the boy says his favorite book is Facebook. While the picture is seemingly humorous and ridiculous, it is thought-provoking on second thought, intending to inform us that the social networks have exerted an important impact on our daily reading. Opinions vary when it comes to the impact of social networking websites on reading. Some-people insist that social networking websites provide large collections of information at great speed and stimulate our reading interest. On the other hand, some people claim that it is a common phenomenon that youngsters spend too much time reading on social networking websites, and it is these websites that make teenagers have less opportunities or time to read traditional books.
　　　There is a saying goes like this, “Every coin has two sides”. So there is no surprise that there are different opinions on the impact of social networking websites on reading. However, I, as a college student, am convinced that it is necessary for us to read on social networking websites, but it is also of greater necessity for us to read traditional books, because social networking websites are just tools and a heavy dependence on them will bring more harm than good.

Part Ⅳ Translation
　　　In China, parents always try every means to help their children, and even make important decisions for them. They never care what their children really want, because they believe that it is good for them. As a result, children’s growth and education tend to surrender to the wills of their parents. If parents decide to sign up for their children to take an extra class to increase their chances of being admitted to a key school, they will stick to their decisions, even if their children are not interested in. While in the United States, parents are likely to respect their children’s opinions，and pay more attention to their opinions in making decisions. It may be worthy of praise for the Chinese parents to attach great importance to education. When it comes to education, however, they should learn how to balance the relationship between parents and their children from American parents.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　As it is, sleep is so undervalued that getting by on fewer hours has become a badge of honor. Plus, we live in a culture that __26__ to the late-nighter, from 24-hour grocery stores to online shopping sites that never close.

　　Whether or not we can catch up on sleep—on the weekend, say —is a hotly __28__ topic among sleep researchers. The latest evidence suggests that while it isn’t __29__ , it might help. When Liu, the UCLA sleep researcher and professor of medicine, brought __30__ sleep-restricted people into the lab for a weekend of sleep during which they logged about 10 hours per night, they showed __31__ in the ability of insulin(胰岛素) to process blood sugar. That suggests that catch-up sleep may undo some but not all of the damage that sleep   __32__ causes, which is encouraging given how many adults don’t get the hours they need each night. Still, Liu isn’t __33__ to endorse the habit of sleeping less and making up for it later.
　　Sleeping pills, while helpful for some, are not __34__ an effective remedy either. “A sleeping pill will   __35__ one area of the brain, but there’s never going to be a perfect sleeping pill, because you couldn’t really replicate(复制) the different chemicals moving in and out of different parts of the brain to go through the different stages of sleep,” says Dr. Nancy Collop, director of the Emory University Sleep Center.


Section B
Directions：In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Climate change may be real, but it’s still not easy being green

How do we convince our inner caveman to be greener? We ask some outstanding social scientists.
[A] The road to climate hell is paved with our good intentions. Politicians may tackle polluters while scientists do battle with carbon emissions. But the most pervasive problem is less obvious: our own behaviour. We get distracted before we can turn down the heating. We break our promise not to fly after hearing about a neighbour’s trip to India. Ultimately, we can’t be bothered to change our attitude. Fortunately for the planet, social science and behavioural economics may be able to do that for us.
[B] Despite mournful polar bears and charts showing carbon emissions soaring, most people find it hard to believe that global warming will affect them personally. Recent polls by the Pew Research Centre in Washington, DC, found that 75-80 percent of participants regarded climate change as an important issue. But respondents ranked it last on a list of priorities.
[C] This inconsistency largely stems from a feeling of powerlessness. “When we can’t actually remove the source of our fear, we tend to adapt psychologically by adopting a range of defense mechanisms,” says Tom Crompton, change strategist for the environmental organization World Wide Fund for Nature.
[D] Part of the fault lies with our inner caveman. Evolution has programmed humans to pay most attention to issues that will have an immediate impact. “We worry most about now because if we don’t survive for the next minute, we’re not going to be around in ten years’ time,” says Professor Elke Weber of the Centre for Research on Environmental Decisions at Columbia University in New York. If the Thames were lapping around Big Ben, Londoners would face up to the problem of emissions pretty quickly. But in practice, our brain discounts the risks —and benefits—associated with issues that lie some way ahead.
[E] Matthew Rush worth, of the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford, sees this in his lab every day. “One of the ways in which all agents seem to make decisions is that they assign a lower weighting to outcomes that are going to be further away in the future,”  he says. “This is a very sensible way for an animal to make decisions in the wild and would have been very helpful for humans for thousands of years.”
[F] Not any longer. By the time we wake up to the threat posed by climate change, it could well be too late. And if we’re not going to make rational decisions about the future, others may have to help us to do so.
[G] Few political libraries are without a copy of Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness, by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. They argue that governments should persuade us into making better decisions—such as saving more in our pension plans—by changing the default options. Professor Weber believes that environmental policy can make use of similar tactics. If, for example, building codes included green construction guidelines, most developers would be too lazy to challenge them.
[H] Defaults are certainly part of the solution. But social scientists are most concerned about crafting messages that exploit our group mentality (心态). “We need to understand what motivates people, what it is that allows them to make change,” says Professor Neil Adger, of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Norwich. “It is actually about what their peers think of them, what their social norms are, what is seen as desirable in society.” In other words, our inner caveman is continually looking over his shoulder to see what the rest of the tribe are up to.
[I] The passive attitude we have to climate change as individuals can be altered by counting us in —and measuring us against—our peer group. “Social norms are primitive and elemental,” says Dr. Robert Cialdini, author of Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion. “Birds flock together, fish school together, cattle herd together.. .just perceiving norms is enough to cause people to adjust their behavior in the direction of the crowd.
[J] These norms can take us beyond good intentions. Cialdini conducted a study in San Diego in which coat hangers bearing messages about saving energy were hung on people’s doors. Some of the messages mentioned the environment, some financial savings, others social responsibility. But it was the ones that mentioned the actions of neighbours that drove down power use.
[K] Other studies show that simply providing the facility for people to compare their energy use with the local average is enough to cause them to modify their behaviour. The Conservatives plan to adopt this strategy by making utility companies print the average local electricity and gas usage on people’s bills.
[L] Social science can also teach politicians how to avoid our collective capacity for self-destructive behaviour. Environmental campaigns that tell us how many people drive SUVs unwittingly(不经意地)imply that this behaviour is widespread and thus permissible. Cialdini recommends some careful framing of the message. “Instead of normalising the undesirable behaviour, the message needs to marginalise it, for example, by stating that if even one person buys yet another SUV, it reduces our ability to be energy-independent.” 
[M] Tapping into how we already see ourselves is crucial. The most successful environmental strategy will marry the green message to our own sense of identity. Take your average trade union member, chances are they will be politically motivated and be used to collective action—much like Erica Gregory. A retired member of the Public and Commercial Services Union, she is setting up one of 1,100 action groups with the support of Climate Solidarity, a two-year environmental campaign aimed at trade unionists.
[N] Erica is proof that a great-grandmother can help to lead the revolution if you get the psychology right—in this case, by matching her enthusiasm for the environment with a fondness for organising groups. “I think it’s a terrific idea,” she says of the campaign. “The union backing it makes members think there must be something in it.” She is expecting up to 20 people at the first meeting she has called, at her local pub in the Cornish village of Polperro.
[O] Nick Perks, project director for Climate Solidarity, believes this sort of activity is where the future of environmental action lies. “Using existing civil society structures or networks is a more effective way of creating change... and obviously trade unions are one of the biggest civil society networks in the UK,” he says. The “Love Food, Hate Waste” campaign entered into a collaboration last year with another such network—the Women’s Institute. Londoner Rachel Taylor joined the campaign with the aim of making new friends. A year on, the meetings have made lasting changes to what she throws away in her kitchen. “It’s always more of an incentive if you’re doing it with other people,” she says. “It motivates you more if you know that you’ve got to provide feedback to a group.”
[P] The power of such simple psychology in fighting climate change is attracting attention across the political establishment. In the US, the House of Representatives Science Committee has approved a bill allocating $ 10 million a year to studying energy-related behaviour. In the UK, new studies are in development and social scientists are regularly spotted in British government offices. With the help of psychologists, there is fresh hope that we might go green after all.
36.When people find they are powerless to change a situation, they tend to live with it.
37.To be effective, environmental messages should be carefully framed.
38.It is the government’s responsibility to persuade people into making environment-friendly decisions.
39.Politicians are beginning to realise the importance of enlisting psychologists, help in fighting climate change.
40.To find effective solutions to climate change, it is necessary to understand what motivates people to make change.
41.In their evolution, humans have learned to pay attention to the most urgent issues instead of long-term concerns.
42.One study shows that our neighbours’ actions are influential in changing our behaviour.
43.Despite clear signs of global warming, it is not easy for most people to believe climate change will affect their own lives.	
44.We should take our future into consideration in making decisions concerning climate change before it is too late.
45.Existing social networks can be more effective in creating change in people’s behaviour.
Section C
Directions:There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A) , B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　More than a decade ago, cognitive scientists John Bransford and Daniel Schwartz, both then at Vanderbilt University, found that what distinguished young adults from children was not the ability to retain facts or apply prior knowledge to a new situation but a quality they called “preparation for future learning.” The researches asked fifth graders and college students to create a recovery plan to protect bald eagles from extinction. Shockingly, the two groups came up with plans of similar quality (though the college students had better spelling skills). From the standpoint of a traditional educator, this outcome indicated that schooling had failed to help students think about ecosystems and extinction, major scientific ideas.
　　The researchers decided to go deeper, however. They asked both groups to generate questions about important issues needed to create recovery plans. On this task, they found large differences. College students focused on critical issues of interdependence between eagles and their habitat(栖息地)Fifth graders tended to focus on features of individual eagles (“How big are they?” and “What do they eat?”). The college students had cultivated the ability to ask questions, the cornerstone of critical thinking. They had learned how to learn.
　　Museums and other institutions of informal learning may be better suited to teach this skill than elementary and secondly schools. At the Exploratorium in San Francisco, we recently studied how learning to ask good questions can affect the quality of people’s scientific inquiry. We found that when we taught participants to ask “What if?” and “How can?” questions that nobody present would know the answer to and that would spark exploration, they engaged in better inquiry at the next exhibit —asking more questions, performing more experiments and making better interpretations of their results. Specially, their questions became more comprehensive at the new exhibit. Rather than merely asking about something they wanted to try, they tended to include both cause and effect in their question. Asking juicy questions appears to be a transferable skill for deepening collaborative inquiry into the science content found in exhibits.
　　This type of learning is not confined to museums or institutional settings. Informal learning environment tolerate failure better than schools. Perhaps many teachers have too little time to allow students to form and pursue their own questions and too much ground to cover in the curriculum. But people must acquire this skill somewhere. Our society depends on them being able to make critical decisions about their own medical treatment, say, or what we must do about global energy needs and demands. For that, we have a robust informal system that gives no grades, takes all comers, and is available even on holidays and weekends.
46.What is traditional educators’ interpretation of the research outcome mentioned in the first paragraph?
　A) Students are not able to apply prior knowledge to new problems.
　B) College students are no better than fifth graders in memorizing issues.
　C) Education has not paid enough attention to major environmental issues.
　D) Education has failed to lead students to think about major scientific ideas.
47.In what way are college students different from children?
　A) They have learned to think critically.	       
　B) They are concerned about social issues.	
　C) They are curious about specific features.
　D) They have learned to work independently.
48.What is benefit of asking questions with no ready answers?
　A) It arouses students’ interest in things around them.
　B) It cultivates students’ ability to make scientific inquiries.
　C) It trains students’ ability to design scientific experiments.
　D) It helps students realize not every question has an answer.
49.What is said to be the advantage of informal learning?
　A) It allows for failures.	        C) It charges no tuition.
　B) It is entertaining.	               D) It meets practical need.
50.What does the author seem to encourage educators to do at the end of the passage?
　A) Train students to think about global issues.
　B) Design more interactive classroom activities.
　C) Make full use of informal learning resources.
　D) Include collaborative inquiry in the curriculum.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　“There’s an old saying in the space world: amateurs talk about technology, professionals talk about insurance.” In an interview last year with The Economist, George Whitesides, chief executive of space-tourism firm Virgin Galactic, was placing his company in the latter category. But insurance will be cold comfort following the failure on October 31st of VSS Enterprise, resulting in the death of one pilot and the severe injury to another.
　　On top of the tragic loss of life, the accident in California will cast a long shadow over the future of space tourism, even before it has properly begun.
　　The notion of space tourism took hold in 2001 with a $ 20 million flight aboard a Russian spacecraft by Dennis Tito, a millionaire engineer with an adventurous streak. Just half a dozen holiday-makers have reached orbit since then, for similarly astronomical price tags. But more recently, companies have begun to plan more affordable “suborbital” flights —briefer ventures just to the edge of space’s vast darkness. Virgin Galactic had, prior to this week’s accident, seemed closest to starting regular flights. The company has already taken deposits from around 800 would-be space tourists, including Stephen Hawking.
　　After being dogged by technical delays for years, Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Galactic’s founder, had recently suggested that a SpaceShipTwo craft would carry its first paying customers as soon as February 2015. That now seems an impossible timeline. In July, a sister craft of the crashed spaceplane was reported to be about half-finished. The other half will have to wait, as authorities of America’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board work out what went wrong.
　　In the meantime, the entire space tourism industry will be on tenterhooks (坐立不安). The 2004 Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act, intended to encourage private space vehicles and services, prohibits the transportation secretary (and thereby the FAA) from regulating the design or operation of private spacecraft, unless they have resulted in a serious or fatal injury to crew or passengers. That means that the FAA could suspend Virgin Galactic’s license to fly. It could also insist on checking private manned spacecraft as thoroughly as it does commercial aircraft. While that may make suborbital travel safer, it would add significant cost and complexity to an emerging industry that has until now operated largely as the playground of billionaires and dreamy engineers.
　　How Virgin Galactic, regulators and the public respond to this most recent tragedy will determine whether and how soon private space travel can transcend that playground. There is no doubt that spaceflight entails risks, and to pioneer a new mode of travel is to free those risks, and to reduce them with the benefit of hard-won experience.	
61.What is said about the failure of VSS Enterprise?
　A) It may lead to the bankruptcy of Virgin Galactic.
　B) It has a strong negative impact on space tourism.
　C) It may discourage rich people from space travel.
　D) It has aroused public attention to safety issues.
62.What do we learn about the space-tourism firm Virgin Galactic?
　A) It has just built a craft for commercial flights.
　B) It has sent half a dozen passengers into space.
　C) It was about ready to start regular business.
　D) It is the first to launch “suborbital” flights.
63.What is the purpose of the 2004 Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act?
　A) To ensure space travel safety.               
　B) To limit the FAA’s functions.               
　C) To legalize private space explorations.
　D) To promote the space tourism industry.
64.What might the FAA do after the recent accident in California?
　A) Impose more rigid safety standards.
　B) Stop certifying new space-tourist agencies.
　C) Amend its 2004 Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act.
　D) Suspend Virgin Galactic’s licence to take passengers into space.
65.What does the author think of private space travel?
　A) It is worth promoting despite the risks involved.   
　B) It should not be confined to the rich only.	     
　C) It should be strictly regulated.
　D) It is too risky to carry on.

　　　The Harm Caused by Misleading Information Online
　　　As is revealed in the picture, a man is sitting in front of a computer searching information from the Internet, while a woman is standing by the door, holding a cup of coffee. The most striking feature is the caption under the picture, which reads “I just feel unfortunate to live in a world with so much misleading information! ”
　　　With a large amount of information coming up, the severity of misleading information arises. Unfortunately, if we lack the ability to distinguish the true information from the misleading one, we will finally fall prey to it, because the misleading information may get people into bad habits, even make them commit crimes. Numerous network fraud is a living example. In addition, there may be a trust crisis between individuals and the government, if we cannot correct the misleading news as soon as possible. For instance, the nuclear leakage in Japan in 2011 has caused great panic in Eastern China, where thousands of people went out to rob salt after the rumor that salt has an effect of anti-radiation, which brought about turbulence in the domestic market.
　　　From what have been discussed above, it is therefore, necessary that some effective measures be taken to prevent ourselves from being misled by junk information. And in my opinion, learning to identify the authenticity of information online is the most practical measure.

　　　China is playing an increasingly important role in helping the international community to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030. Since the implementation of the reform and opening up in the late 1970s, China has helped as many as four hundred million people out of poverty. Over the next five years, China will provide assistance to other developing countries in poverty reduction, education development, agricultural modernization, environmental protection and health care. China has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty, and has made unremitting efforts to promote economic growth, which will encourage other poor countries to respond to the challenges of their own developments. These countries can learn from the experience of China when they seek paths of development with their own characteristics.

　　　Pursuing a career is an essential part of adolescent development. “The adolescent becomes an adult when he									26												a real job.” To cognitive researchers like Piaget,  adulthood meant the beginning of an											27											.
　　　Piaget argued that once adolescents enter the world of work, their newly acquired ability to form hypotheses allows them to create representations that are too ideal. The  									28												of such ideals, without the tempering of the reality of a job or profession, rapidly leads adolescents to become											29												of the non-idealistic world and to press for reform in a characteristically adolescent way. Piaget said: “True adaptation to society comes								30											when the adolescent reformer attempts to put his ideas to work.”
　　　Of course, youthful idealism is often courageous, and no one likes to give up dreams. Perhaps, taken									31											out of context, Piaget’s statement seems harsh. What he was   						32 								, however, is the way reality can modify idealistic views. Some people refer to such modification as maturity. Piaget argued
　　　that attaining and accepting a vocation is one of the best ways to modify idealized views and to mature. As careers and vocations become less available during times of      	 		33									, adolescents may be especially hard hit. Such difficult economic times may leave many adolescents										34												about their roles in society. For this reason, community interventions and government job programs that offer summer and vacation work are not only economically												35											but also help to stimulate the adolescent’s sense of worth.

　　　　　　　　　　　H) existence	

Section B 
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
　　Can Societies be rich and green?
　　[A]	“If our economies are to flourish, if global poverty is to be eliminated and if the well-being of the world’s people enhanced—not just in this generation but in succeeding generations—we must make sure we take care of the natural environment and resources on which our economic activity depends.” That statement comes not, as you might imagine, from a stereotypical tree-hugging, save-the-world greenie (环保主义者), but from Gordon Brown, a politician with a reputation for rigour, thoroughness and above all, caution.
　　[B] 	A surprising thing for the man who runs one of the world’s most powerful economies  to say? Perhaps; though in the run-up to the five-year review of the millennium (千年的) Goals, he is far from alone. The roots of his speech, given in March at the roundtable meeting of environment and energy ministers from the G20 group of nations, stretch back to 1972, and the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm.
　　[C] 	“The protection and improvement of the human environment is a major issue which affects the well-being of peoples and economic development throughout the world,” read the final declaration from this gathering, the first of a sequence which would lead to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in 1992 and the World Development Summit in Johannesburg three years ago.
　　[D] 	Hunt through the reports prepared by UN agencies and development groups—many for conferences such as this year’s Millennium Goals review—and you will find that  the linkage between environmental protection and economic progress is a common thread.
　　[E] 	Managing ecosystems sustainably is more profitable than exploiting them, according to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. But finding hard evidence to support the thesis is not so easy. Thoughts turn first to some sort of global statistic, some indicator which would rate the wealth of nations in both economic and environmental terms and show a relationship between the two.
　　[F] 	If such an indicator exists, it is well hidden. And on reflection, this is not surprising; the single word “environment” has so many dimensions, and there are so many other factors affecting wealth—such as the oil deposits—that teasing out a simple economy-environment relationship would be almost impossible.
　　[G]	The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a vast four-year global study which reported its initial conclusions earlier this year, found reasons to believe that managing ecosystems sustainably— working with nature rather than against it—might be less profitable in the short term, but certainly brings long-term rewards.
　　[H]	And the World Resources Institute (WRI) in its World Resources 2005 report, issued at the end of August, produced several such examples from Africa and Asia; it also demonstrated that environmental degradation affects the poor more than the rich, as poorer people derive a much higher proportion of their income directly from the natural resources around them.
　　[I]	But there are also many examples of growing wealth by trashing the environment, in rich and poor parts of the world alike, whether through unregulated mineral extraction, drastic water use for agriculture, slash-and-burn farming, or fossil-fuel-guzzling (大量消耗) transport. Of course, such growth may not persist in the long term—which is what Mr. Brown and the Stockholm declaration were both attempting to point out. Perhaps the best example of boom growth and bust decline is the Grand Banks fishery. For almost five centuries a very large supply of cod (鳕鱼) provided abundant raw material for an industry which at its peak employed about 40,000 people, sustaining entire communities in Newfoundland. Then, abruptly, the cod population collapsed. There were no longer enough fish in the sea for the stock to maintain itself, let alone an industry. More than a decade later, there was no sign of the ecosystem   re-building itself. It had, apparently, been fished out of existence; and the once mighty Newfoundland fleet now gropes about frantically for crab on the sea floor.
　　[J] 	There is a view that modern humans are inevitably sowing the seed of a global Grand Banks-style disaster. The idea is that we are taking more out of what you might call  the planet’s environmental bank balance than it can sustain; we are living beyond our ecological means. One recent study attempted to calculate the extent of this “ecological overshoot of the human economy”, and found that we are using 1.2 Earth’s-worth of environmental goods and services—the implication being that at some point the debt will be called in, and all those services—the things which the planet does for us for free—will grind to a halt.
　　[K]	Whether this is right, and if so where and when the ecological axe will fall, is hard to determine with any precision—which is why governments and financial institutions are only beginning to bring such risks into their economic calculations. It is also the reason why development agencies are not united in their view of environmental issues; while some, like the WRI, maintain that environmental progress needs to go hand-in-hand with economic development, others argue that the priority is to build a thriving economy, and then use the wealth created to tackle environmental degradation.
　　[L] 	This view assumes that rich societies will invest in environmental care. But is this right? Do things get better or worse as we get richer? Here the Stockholm declaration is ambiguous. “In the developing countries,” it says, “most of the environmental problems are caused by under-development,” So it is saying that economic development should make for a cleaner world? Not necessarily. “In the industrialised countries, environmental problems are generally related to industrialisation and technological development,” it continues. In other words, poor and rich both over-exploit the natural world, but for different reasons. It’s simply not true that economic growth will surely make our world cleaner.
　　[M]	Clearly, richer societies are able to provide environmental improvements which lie well beyond the reach of poorer communities. Citizens of wealthy nations demand national parks, clean rivers, clean air and poison-free food. They also, however, use far more natural resources—fuel, water (all those baths and golf courses) and building materials.
　　[N]	A case can be made that rich nations export environmental problems, the most graphic example being climate change. As a country’s wealth grows, so do its greenhouse gas  emissions. The figures available will not be completely accurate. Measuring emissions is not a precise science, particularly when it comes to issues surrounding land use; not all nations have released up-to-date data, and in any case, emissions from some sectors such as aviation are not included in national statistics. But the data is exact enough for a clear trend to be easily discernible. As countries become richer, they produce more greenhouse gases; and the impact of those gases will fall primarily in poor parts of the world.
　　[O]	Wealth is not, of course, the only factor involved. The average Norwegian is better off than the average US citizen, but contributes about half as much to climate change. But could Norway keep its standard of living and yet cut its emissions to Moroccan or even Ethiopian levels? That question, repeated across a dozen environmental issues and across our diverse planet, is what will ultimately determine whether the human race is living beyond its ecological means as it pursues economic revival.
　　36.	Examples show that both rich and poor countries exploited the environment for economic progress.
　　37.	Environmental protection and improvement benefit people all over the world.
　　38.	It is not necessarily true that economic growth will make our world cleaner.
　　39	The common theme of the UN reports is the relation between environmental protection and economic growth.
　　40.	Development agencies disagree regarding how to tackle environment issues while ensuring economic progress.
　　41.	It is difficult to find solid evidence to prove environmental friendliness generates more profits than exploiting the natural environment.
　　42.	Sustainable management of ecosystems will prove rewarding in the long run.
　　43.	A politician noted for being cautious asserts that sustainable human development depends on the natural environment.
　　44.	Poor countries will have to bear the cost for rich nations’ economic development.
　　45.	One recent study warns us of the danger of the exhaustion of natural resources on Earth.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Interactive television advertising, which allows viewers to use their remote controls to click on advertisements, has been pushed for years. Nearly a decade ago it was predicted that viewers of “ Friends”, a popular situation comedy, would soon be able to purchase a sweater like Jennifer Aniston’s with a few taps on their remote control. “ It’s been the year of interactive  television advertising for the last ten or twelve years,” says Colin Dixon of a digital-media consultancy. So the news that Cablevision, an American cable company, was rolling out interactive advertisements to all its customers on October 6th was greeted with some skepticism. During commercials, an overlay will appear at the bottom of the screen, prompting viewers to press a button to request a free sample or order a catalogue. Cablevision hopes to allow customers to buy things with their remote controls early next year.
　　　Television advertising could do with a boost. Spending fell by 10% in the first half of the year. The popularization of digital video recorders has caused advertisers to worry that their commercials will be skipped. Some are turning to the Internet, which is cheaper and offers concrete measurements like click-through rates—especially important at a time when marketing budgets are tight. With the launch of interactive advertising, “many of the dollars that went to the Internet will come back to the TV,” says David Kline of Cablevision. Or so the industry hopes.
　　　In theory, interactive advertising can engage viewers in a way that 30-second spots do not. Unilever recently ran an interactive campaign for its Axe deodorant (除臭剂), which kept viewers engaged for more than three minutes on average.
　　　The amount spent on interactive advertising on television is still small. Magna, an advertising agency, reckons it will be worth about $ 138 million this year. That falls far short of the billions of dollars people once expected it to generate. But DirecTV, Comcast and Time Warner Cable have all invested in it. A new effort led by Canoe Ventures, a coalition of leading cable providers, aims to make interactive advertising available across America later this year. BrightLine iTV, which designs and sells interactive ads, says  interest has surged: it expects its revenues almost to triple this year. BSkyB, Britain’s biggest satellite-television service, already provides 9 million customers with interactive ads. 
　　　Yet there are doubts whether people watching television, a “lean back” medium, crave interaction.Click-through rates have been high so far (around 3-4% , compared with less than 0.3% online), but that may be a result of the novelty. Interactive ads and viewers might not go well together.
46.What does Colin Dixon mean by saying “It’s been the year of interactive television  advertising for the last ten or twelve years” (Lines 4, Para.1)?
　　　A) Interactive television advertising will become popular in 10-12 years.
　　　B) Interactive television advertising has been under debate for the last decade or so.
　　　C) Interactive television advertising is successful when incorporated into situation comedies.
　　　D) Interactive television advertising has not achieved the anticipated results.
47. What is the public’s response to Cablevision’s planned interactive TV advertising program?
　　　A) Pretty positive.	
　　　B) Totally indifferent.	
　　　C) Somewhat doubtful.
　　　D) Rather critical.
48. What is the impact of the wide use of digital video recorders on TV advertising?
　　　A) It has made TV advertising easily accessible to viewers.
　　　B) It helps advertisers to measure the click-through rates.
　　　C) It has placed TV advertising at a great disadvantage.
　　　D) It enables viewers to check the sales items with ease.
49. What do we learn about Unilever’s interactive campaign?
　　　A) It proves the advantage of TV advertising.
　　　B) It has done well in engaging the viewers.
　　　C) It helps attract investments in the company.
　　　D) It has boosted the TV advertising industry.
50. How does the author view the hitherto high click-through rates?
　　　A) They may be due to the novel way of advertising.
　　　B) They signify the popularity of interactive advertising.
　　　C) They point to the growing curiosity of TV viewers.
　　　D) They indicate the future direction of media reform.
Passage Two 
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　What can be done about mass unemployment? All the wise heads agree: there’re no  quick or easy answers. There’s work to be done, but workers aren’t ready to do it—they’re in the wrong places, or they have the wrong skills. Our problems are “ structural,” and will take many years to solve.
　　　But don’t bother asking for evidence that justifies this bleak view. There isn’t any. On the contrary, all the facts suggest that high unemployment in America is the result of inadequate demand. Saying that there’re no easy answers sounds wise, but it’s actually foolish: our unemployment crisis could be cured very quickly if we had the intellectual  clarity and political will to act. In other words, structural unemployment is a fake problem, which mainly serves as an excuse for not pursing real solutions.
　　　The fact is job openings have plunged in every major sector, while the number of workers forced into part-time employment in almost all industries has soared. Unemployment has surged in every major occupational category. Only three states, with a combined population not much larger than that of Brooklyn, have unemployment rates below 5%. So the evidence contradicts the claim that we’re mainly suffering from structural unemployment. Why, then, has this claim become so popular?
　　　Part of the answer is that this is what always happens during periods of high unemployment—in part because experts and analysts believe that declaring the problem deeply rooted, with no easy answers, makes them sound serious.
　　　I’ve been looking at what self-proclaimed experts were saying about unemployment  during the Great Depression; it was almost identical to what Very Serious People are saying now. Unemployment cannot be brought down rapidly, declared one 1935 analysis, because  the workforce is “ unadaptable and untrained. It cannot respond to the opportunities which industry may offer.” A few years later, a large defense buildup finally provided a fiscal  stimulus adequate to the economy’s needs—and suddenly industry was eager to employ those “ unadaptable and untrained” workers.
　　　But now, as then, powerful forces are ideologically opposed to the whole idea of government action on a sufficient scale to jump-start the economy. And that, fundamentally, is why claims that we face huge structural problems have been multiplying: they offer a reason to do nothing about the mass unemployment that is crippling our economy and our society.
　　　So what you need to know is that there’s no evidence whatsoever to back these claims. We aren’t suffering from a shortage of needed skills; we’re suffering from a lack of policy  resolve. As I said, structural unemployment isn’t a real problem, it’s an excuse—a reason not to act on America’s problems at a time when action is desperately needed.
51.What does the author think is the root cause of mass unemployment in America?
　　　A) Corporate mismanagement.	
　　　B) Insufficient demand.	
　　　C) Technological advances.
　　　D) Workers’ slow adaptation.
52. What does the author think of the experts’ claim concerning unemployment?
　　　A) Self-evident.	
　　　B) Thought-provoking.	
　　　C) Irrational.
　　　D) Groundless.
53. What does the author say helped bring down unemployment during the Great Depression?
　　　A) The booming defense industry.	
　　　B) The wise heads’ benefit package.	
　　　C) Nationwide training of workers.
　　　D) Thorough restructuring of industries.
54. What has caused claims of huge structural problems to multiply?
　　　A) Powerful opposition to government’s stimulus efforts.
　　　B) Very Serious People’s attempt to cripple the economy.
　　　C) Evidence gathered from many sectors of the industries.
　　　D) Economists’ failure to detect the problems in time.
55. What is the author’s purpose in writing the passage?
　　　A) To testify to the experts’ analysis of America’s problems.
　　　B) To offer a feasible solution to the structural unemployment.
　　　C) To show the urgent need for the government to take action.
　　　D) To alert American workers to the urgency for adaptation.

Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
The Changing Generation
A)	It turns out today’s teenagers aren’t so scary after all. Results of USA WEEKEND’s  Teens & Parents survey reveal a generation of young people who get along well with their parents and approve of the way they’re being raised. They think of their parents  with affection and respect. They speak with Mom or Dad when they have a problem. Most feel that their parents understand them, and they believe their family is the No. 1 priority in their parents’ lives. Many even think their parents are cool! Although more than a third have an object in their rooms they would like to keep secret from their  parents, rarely is it anything more alarming than a diary or off-color (低俗的) book or CD.
B)	Such results may seem surprising against the background of shocking incidents that color the way the mass media portray the young. In October 2000, the same month the survey was taken, the Washington-based Center for Media and Public Affairs wrote in its publication Media Monitor that, in a recent month of TV news coverage of American youth, just 2% of teens were shown at home, and just 1% were portrayed in a work setting. In contrast, the criminal justice system accounted for nearly one out of every five visual backgrounds. No wonder parents worry their own kids might spin out of control once they hit the turbulent waters of adolescence.
C)	The overall facts ought to reassure us. The survey shows us that today’s teens are affectionate, sensible and far happier than the angry and tortured souls that have been painted for us by stereotypes. From other sources, we also know teenage crime, drug abuse and premarital sex are in general decline. We,of course, need to pay attention to youngsters who are filled with discontent and hostility, but we should not allow these extreme cases to distort our view of most young people.
D)	My own research at the Stanford Center on Adolescence uses in-depth interviews with small samples of youngsters rather than large-scale surveys. Still, in my studies and others I have read, I find the same patterns as in USA WEEKEND’S survey. Today’s teenagers admire their parents and welcome parental guidance about important matters such as career choice—though certainly not Mom and Dad’s advice on matters of personal taste, such as music or fashion. When we ask teens to choose a hero, they usually select an older family member rather than a remote public figure. Most teens say they enjoy the company of both parents and friends.
E)	Contrary to some stereotypes, most adolescents believe they must be tolerant of differences among individuals (though they do not always find this easy in the cliquish (拉帮结派的) environment of high school). Many of them volunteer for community service with disadvantaged people. One prevalent quality we have found in teens’ statements about themselves, their friends and their families is a strikingly positive emotional tone. By and large, these are very nice kids, and as the band The Who used to sing, “ The kids are alright.”
F)	How much is today’s spirit of harmony a change from our more turbulent past? A mere generation ago, parent-child relations were described as “the generation gap”. Yet even then reports of widespread youth rebellion were overdone: Most kids in the ’60s and ’70s shared their parents’ basic values. Still, it is true that American families are growing closer at the dawn of this new millennium (千年). Perhaps there is less to fight about, with the country in a period of tranquility and the dangers of drug abuse and other unwholesome behavior well known. Perhaps in the face of impersonal and intimidating globalization, a young person’s family feels more like a friendly haven than an oppressive trap. And perhaps parents are acting more like parents than in the recent past. Within just the past five years, I have noticed parents returning to a belief that teenagers need the guidance of elders rather than the liberal, “anything goes” mode of child-rearing that became popular in the second half of the 20th century.
G)	But missing from all these data is the sense that today’s young care very much about their country, about the broader civic and political environment, or about the future of their society. They seem to be turning inward-generally in a pro-social manner, certainly with positive benefits for intimate relationships, but too often at the expense of a connection with the present and future world beyond, including the society they will one day inherit.
H)	Recently, we examined more than 400 essays on the “ laws of life ” that teens from two communities had written as part of an educational program initiated by the John Templeton Foundation in Radnor, Pa. In those essays, and in follow-up interviews with a few of the teenagers, we found lots of insight, positive feeling and inspirational thinking. But we also found little interest in civic life beyond the tight circles of their family and immediate friends.
I)	For example, only one boy said he would like to be president when he grows up. When I was in high school, dozens in my class alone would have answered differently. In fact, other recent studies have found there has never been a time in American history when so small a proportion of young people have sought or accepted leadership roles in local civic organizations. It is also troubling that voting rates among our youngest eligible voters—18-to 24-year-olds—are way down: Little more than one in four now go to the polls, even in national elections, compared with almost twice that many when 18-year-olds were first given the vote.
J)	In our interviews, many students viewed politics with suspicion and distaste. “Most  politicians are kind of crooked (不诚实的),” one student declared. Another, discussing national politics, said, “I feel like one person can’t do that much, and I get the impression  most people don’t think a group of people can do that much.” Asked what they would like to change in the world, the students mentioned only personal concerns such as slowing down the pace of life, gaining good friends, becoming more spiritual, becoming either more materially successful or less materially oriented (depending on the student’s values), and being more respectful of the Earth, animals and other people. One boy said, “I’d rather be concentrating on artistic efforts than saving the world or something.”
K)	It is fine and healthy for teens to cultivate their personal interests, and it is good news when young people enjoy harmonious relations with their family and friends. But there is also a place in a young life for noble purposes that include a dedication to the broader society, a love of country and an aspiration to make their own leadership contributions.
L)	In the past, the young have eagerly participated in national service and civic affairs, often with lots of energy and idealism. If this is not happening today, we should ask why. Our society needs the full participation of its younger citizens if it is to continue to thrive. We know the promise is there—this is a well-grounded, talented, warm-hearted group of youngsters. We have everything to gain by encouraging them to explore the world beyond their immediate experience and to prepare themselves for their turn at shaping that world.
36.	Not many young people eligible for voting are interested in local or national elections these days.
37.	Parents are concerned that their children may get involved in criminal offences once they reach their teens.
38.	Even during the turbulent years of last century, youth rebellion was often exaggerated in the media.
39.	Teenagers of today often turn to their parents for advice on such important matters as career choice.
40.	The incidence of teenage crime and misbehavior is decreasing nowadays.
41.	Young people should have lofty ideals in life and strive to be leaders.
42.	Some young people like to keep something to themselves and don’t want their parents to know about it.
43.	It is beneficial to encourage young people to explore the broader word and get ready to make it a better place.
44.	Many teenagers now offer to render service to the needy.
45.	Interviews with students find many of them are only concerned about personal matters.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One 
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage. 
　　　Manufacturers of products that claim to be environmentally friendly will face tighter rules on how they are advertised to consumers under changes proposed by the Federal Trade Commission.
　　　The commission’s revised “Green Guides” warn marketers against using labels that make broad claims, like “eco-friendly”. Marketers must qualify their claims on the product packaging and limit them to a specific benefit, such as how much of the product is recycled.
　　　“This is really about trying to cut through the confusion that consumers have when they are buying a product and that businesses have when they are selling a product,” said Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the commission.
　　　The revisions come at a time when green marketing is on the rise. According to a new study, the number of advertisements with green messages in mainstream magazines has risen since 1987, and peaked in 2008 at 10.4%. In 2009, the number dropped to 9% .
　　　But while the number of advertisements may have dipped, there has been a rapid spread of eco-labeling. There are both good and bad players in the eco-labeling game.
　　　In the last five years or so, there has been an explosion of green claims and environmental claims. It is clear that consumers don’t always know what they are getting.
　　　A handful of lawsuits have been filed in recent years against companies accused of using misleading environmental labels. In 2008 and 2009, class-action lawsuits (集体诉讼) were filed against SC Johnson for using “ Greenlist” labels on its cleaning products. The lawsuits said that the label was misleading because it gave the impression that the products had been certified by a third party when the certification was the company’s own.
　　　“ We are very proud of our accomplishments under the Greenlist system and we believe that we will prevail in these cases,” Christopher Beard, director of public affairs for SC Johnson, said, while acknowledging that “ this has been an area that is difficult to navigate.”
　　　Companies have also taken it upon themselves to contest each other’s green claims.
　　　David Mallen, associate director of the Council of Better Business Bureau, said in the last two years the organization had seen an increase in the number of claims companies were bringing against each other for false or misleading environmental product claims.
　　　“About once a week, I have a client that will bring up a new certification I’ve never even heard of and I’m in this industry,” said Kevin Wilhelm, chief executive officer of Sustainable Business Consulting. “It’s kind of a Wild West, anybody can claim themselves to be green.” Mr. Wilhelm said the excess of labels made it difficult for businesses and consumers to know which labels they should pay attention to.

　　A) Manufacture as many green products as possible.
　　B) Indicate whether their products are recyclable.
　　C) Specify in what way their products are green.
　　D) Attach green labels to all of their products.
47. What does the author say about consumers facing an explosion of green claims?
　　A) They can easily see through the businesses’ tricks.
　　B) They have to spend lots of time choosing products.
　　C) They have doubt about current green certification.
　　D) They are not clear which products are truly green.
48. What was SC Johnson accused of in the class-action lawsuits?

　　A) Businesses compete to produce green products.
　　B) Each business acts its own way in green labeling.
　　C) Consumers grow wild with products labeled green.
　　D) Anything produced in the West can be labeled green.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　America’s education system has become less a ladder of opportunity than a structure to transmit inequality from one generation to the next.
　　　That’s why school reform is so critical. This is an issue of equality, opportunity and national conscience. It’s not just about education, but about poverty and justice.
　　　It’s true that the main reason inner-city schools do poorly isn’t teachers’ unions, but poverty. Southern states without strong teachers’ unions have schools at least as awful as those in union states. Some Chicago teachers seem to think that they shouldn’t be held accountable until poverty is solved. There’re steps we can take that would make some difference, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel is trying some of them—yet the union is resisting.
　　　I’d be sympathetic if the union focused solely on higher compensation. Teachers need to be much better paid to attract the best college graduates to the nation’s worst schools. But, instead, the Chicago union seems to be using its political capital primarily to protect weak performers.
　　　There’s solid evidence that there are huge differences in the effectiveness of teachers. The gold standard study by Harvard and Columbia University scholars found that even in high-poverty schools, teachers consistently had a huge positive or negative impact.
　　　Get a bottom 1% teacher, and the effect is the same as if a child misses 40% of the school year. Get a teacher from the top 20% , and it’s as if a child has gone to school for an extra month or two. The study found that strong teachers in the fourth through eighth grades raised the skills of their students in ways that would last for decades. Just having a strong teacher for one elementary year left pupils a bit less likely to become mothers as teenagers, a bit more likely to go to college and earning more money at age 28.
　　　How does one figure out who is a weak teacher? Yes, that’s a challenge. But researchers are improving systems to measure a teacher’s performance throughout the year, and, with three years of data, it’s usually possible to tell which teachers are failing.
　　　Unfortunately, the union in Chicago is insisting that teachers who are laid off—often for being ineffective—should get priority in new hiring. That’s an insult to students.
　　　Teaching is so important that it should be like other professions, with high pay and good working conditions but few job protections for bottom performers.
　　　This isn’t a battle between garment workers and greedy bosses. The central  figures in the Chicago schools strike are neither strikers nor managers but 350,000 children. Protecting the union demand sacrifices those students, in effect turning a blind eye to the injustice in the education system.
　　　
51. What do we learn about America’s education system?
　　A) It provides a ladder of opportunity for the wealthy.
　　B) It contributes little to the elimination of inequality.
　　C) It has remained basically unchanged for generations.
　　D) It has brought up generations of responsible citizens.
52. What is chiefly responsible for the undesirable performance of inner-city schools?
　　A) Unqualified teachers.	
　　B) Lack of financial resources.	
　　C) Unfavorable learning environment.
　　D) Subconscious racial discrimination.
53. What does the author think the union should do to win popular support?
　　A) Assist the city government in reforming schools.
　　B) Give constructive advice to inner-city schools.
　　C) Demand higher pay for teachers.
　　D) Help teachers improve teaching.
54. What is the finding of the gold standard study by Harvard and Columbia University scholars?
　　A) Many inner-city school teachers are not equal to their jobs.
　　B) A large proportion of inner-city children often miss classes.
　　C) Many students are dissatisfied with their teachers.
　　D) Student performance has a lot to do with teachers.
55.Why does the author say the Chicago union’s demand is an insult to students?
　　A) It protects incompetent teachers at the expense of students.
　　B) It underestimates students’ ability to tell good teachers from poor ones.
　　C) It makes students feel that they are discriminated against in many ways.
　　D) It totally ignores students’ initiative in the learning process.

　　The robotics revolution is set to bring humans face to face with an old fear—man-made creations as smart and capable as we are but without a moral compass.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Reform and Medical Costs
[A]	Americans are deeply concerned about the relentless rise in health care costs and	health insurance premiums. They need to know if reform will help solve the problem. The answer is that no one has an easy fix for rising medical costs. The fundamental fix—reshaping how care is delivered and how doctors are paid in a wasteful, abnormal system—is likely to be achieved only through trial and error and incremental (渐进的) gains.
[B] 	The good news is that a bill just approved by the House and a bill approved by the	Senate Finance Committee would implement or test many reforms that should help slow the rise in medical costs over the long term. As a report in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded, “Pretty much every proposed innovation found in the health policy literature these days is contained in these measures.”
[C] 	Medical spending, which typically rises faster than wages and the overall economy, is propelled by two things: the high prices charged for medical services in this country and the volume of unnecessary care delivered by doctors and hospitals, which often perform a lot more tests and treatments than a patient really needs.
[D] 	Here are some of the important proposals in the House and Senate bills to try to address those problems, and why it is hard to know how well they will work.
[E] 	Both bills would reduce the rate of growth in annual Medicare payments to hospitals, nursing homes and other providers by amounts comparable to the productivity savings routinely made in other industries with the help of new technologies and new ways to organize work. This proposal could save Medicare more than $ 100 billion over the next decade. If private plans demanded similar productivity savings from providers, and refused to let providers shift additional costs  to them, the savings could be much larger. Critics say Congress will give in to lobbyists and let inefficient providers off the hook (放过). That is far less likely to happen if Congress also adopts strong “ pay-go” rules requiring that any increase in payments to providers be offset by new taxes or budget cuts.
[F] 	The Senate Finance bill would impose an excise tax (消费税) on health insurance plans that cost more than $ 8,000 for an individual or $ 21,000 for a family. It would most likely cause insurers to redesign plans to fall beneath the threshold. Enrollees would have to pay more money for many services out of their own pockets, and that would encourage them to think twice about whether an expensive or redundant test was worth it. Economists project that most employers would shift money from expensive health benefits into wages, The House bill has no similar tax. The final legislation should.
[G] 	Any doctor who has wrestled with multiple forms from different insurers, or patients who have tried to understand their own parade of statements, know that simplification ought to save money. When the health insurance industry was still cooperating in reform efforts, its trade group offered to provide standardized forms for automated processing. It estimated that step would save hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. The bills would lock that pledge into law.
[H]	The stimulus package provided money to convert the inefficient, paper⁃driven medical system to electronic records that can be easily viewed and transmitted. This requires open investments to help doctors convert. In time it should help restrain costs by eliminating redundant tests, preventing drug interactions, and helping doctors find the best treatments.
[I]	Virtually all experts agree that the fee⁃for⁃service system—doctors are rewarded for the quantity of care rather than its quality or effectiveness—is a primary reason that the cost of care is so high. Most agree that the solution is to push doctors to accept fixed payments to care for a particular illness or for a patient’s needs over a year. No one knows how to make that happen quickly. The bills in both houses would start pilot projects within Medicare. They include such measures as accountable care organizations to take charge of a patient’s needs with an eye on both cost and quality, and chronic disease management to make sure the seriously ill, who are responsible for the bulk of all health care costs, are treated properly. For the most part, these experiments rely on incentive payments to get doctors to try them.
[G]	Testing innovations do no good unless the good experiments are identified and expanded and the bad ones are dropped. The Senate bill would create an independent commission to monitor the pilot programs and recommend changes in Medicare’s payment policies to urge providers to adopt reforms that work. The changes would have to be approved or rejected as a whole by Congress, making it hard for narrow-interest lobbies to bend lawmakers to their will.
[K]	The bills in both chambers would create health insurance exchanges on which  small businesses and individuals could choose from an array of private plans and possibly a public option. All the plans would have to provide standard benefit packages that would be easy to compare. To get access to millions of new customers, insurers would have a strong incentive to lower their prices, perhaps by accepting slimmer profit margins or demanding better deals from providers.
[L]	The final legislation might throw a public plan into the competition, but thanks to the fierce opposition of the insurance industry and Republican critics, it might not save much money. The one in the House bill would have to negotiate rates with providers, rather than using Medicare rates, as many reformers wanted.
[M]	The president’s stimulus package is pumping money into research to compare how well various treatments work. Is surgery, radiation or careful monitoring best for prostate (前列腺) cancer? Is the latest and most expensive cholesterol⁃lowering drug any better than its common competitors? The pending bills would spend additional money to accelerate this effort.
[N]	Critics have charged that this sensible idea would lead to rationing of care. (That would be true only if you believed that patients should have an unrestrained right to treatments proven to be inferior.) As a result, the bills do not require, as they should, that the results of these studies be used to set payment rates in Medicare.
[O]	Congress needs to find the courage to allow Medicare to pay preferentially for treatments proven to be superior. Sometimes the best treatment might be the most expensive. But overall, we suspect that spending would come down through elimination of a lot of unnecessary or even dangerous tests and treatments.
[P]	The House bill would authorize the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices in Medicare and Medicaid. Some authoritative analysts doubt that the secretary would get better deals than private insurers already get. We believe negotiation could work. It does in other countries.
[Q]	Missing from these bills is any serious attempt to rein in malpractice costs. Malpractice awards do drive up insurance premiums for doctors in high⁃risk specialties, and there is some evidence that doctors engage in “defensive medicine” by performing tests and treatments primarily to prove they are not negligent should they get sued.
36.	With a tax imposed on expensive health insurance plans, most employers will likely transfer money from health expenses into wages.
37.	Changes in policy would be approved or rejected as a whole so that lobbyists would find it hard to influence lawmakers.
38.	It is not easy to curb the rising medical costs in America.
39.	Standardization of forms for automatic processing will save a lot of medical expenses.
40	Republicans and the insurance industry are strongly opposed to the creation of a public insurance plan.
41.	Conversion of paper to electronic medical records will help eliminate redundant tests and prevent drug interactions.
42.	The high cost of medical services and unnecessary tests and treatments have driven up medical expenses.
43.	One main factor that has driven up medical expenses is that doctors are compensated for the amount of care rather than its effect.
44.	Contrary to analysts’ doubts, the author believes drug prices may be lowered through negotiation.
45.	Fair competition might create a strong incentive for insurers to charge less.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Facing water shortages and escalating fertilizer costs, farmers in developing countries are using raw sewage (下水道污水) to irrigate and fertilize nearly 49 million acres of cropland, according to a new report—and it may not be a bad thing.
　　　While the practice carries serious health risks for many, those dangers are outweighed by the social and economic gains for poor urban farmers and consumers who need affordable food.
　　　“There is a large potential for wastewater agriculture to both help and hurt great numbers of urban consumers,” said Liqa Raschid-Sally, who led the study.
　　　The report focused on poor urban areas, where farms in or near cities supply  relatively inexpensive food. Most of these operations draw irrigation water from local rivers or lakes. Unlike developed cities, however, these areas lack advanced water-treatment facilities, and rivers effectively become sewers (下水道).
　　　When this water is used for agricultural irrigation, farmers risk absorbing disease-causing bacteria, as do consumers who eat the produce raw and unwashed. Nearly 2.2 million people die each year because of diarrhea-related (与腹泻相关的) diseases, according to WHO statistics. More than 80% of those cases can be attributed to contact with contaminated water and a lack of proper sanitation. But Pay Drechsel, an environmental scientist, argues that the social and economic benefits of using untreated human waste to grow food outweigh the health risks.
　　　Those dangers can be addressed with farmer and consumer education, he said, while the free water and nutrients from human waste can help urban farmers in developing countries to escape poverty.
　　　Agriculture is a water-intensive business, accounting for nearly 70% of global fresh water consumption.
　　　In poor, dry regions, untreated wastewater is the only viable irrigation source to keep farmers in business. In some cases, water is so scarce that farmers break open sewage pipes transporting waste to local rivers.
　　　Irrigation is the primary agricultural use of human waste in the developing world. But frequently untreated human waste harvested from lavatories is delivered to farms and spread as fertilizer.
　　　In most cases, the human waste is used on grain crops, which are eventually cooked, minimizing the risk of transmitting water-borne diseases. With fertilizer prices jumping nearly 50% per metric ton over the last year in some places, human waste is an attractive, and often necessary, alternative.
　　　In cases where sewage mud is used, expensive chemical fertilizer use can be avoided. The mud contains the same critical nutrients.
　　　“Overly strict standards often fail,” James Bartram, a WHO water-health expert, said. “We need to accept that fact across much of the planet, so waste with little or no treatment will be used in agriculture for good reason.”
46.What does the author say about the use of raw sewage for farming?
　　　A) Its risks cannot be overestimated.
　　　B) It should be forbidden altogether.
　　　C) Its benefits outweigh the hazards involved.
　　　D) It is polluting millions of acres of cropland.
47.What is the main problem caused by the use of wastewater for irrigation?
　　　A) Rivers and lakes nearby will gradually become contaminated.
　　　B) It will drive producers of chemical fertilizers out of business.
　　　C) Farmers and consumers may be affected by harmful bacteria.
　　　D) It will make the farm produce less competitive on the market.
48.What is environmental scientist Pay Drechsel’s attitude towards the use of untreated human waste in agriculture?
　　　A) Favorable.	C) Indifferent.
　　　B) Skeptical.	D) Responsible.
49. What does Pay Dreschsel think of the risks involved in using untreated human waste for farming?
　　　A) They have been somewhat exaggerated.
　　　B) They can be dealt with through education.
　　　C) They will be minimized with new technology.
　　　D) They can be addressed by improved sanitation.
50.What do we learn about James Bartram’s position on the use of human waste for farming?
　　　A) He echoes Pay Drechsel’s opinion on the issue.
　　　B) He challenges Liqa Raschid-Sally’s conclusion
　　　C) He thinks it the only way out of the current food crisis.
　　　D) He deems it indispensable for combating global poverty.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　These days, nobody needs to cook. Families graze on high⁃cholesterol take-aways and microwaved ready-meals. Cooking is an occasional hobby and a vehicle for celebrity chefs. Which makes it odd that the kitchen has become the heart of the modern house: what the great hall was to the medieval castle, the kitchen is to the 21st-century home.
　　　The money spent on kitchens has risen with their status. In America the kitchen market is now worth $ 170 billion, five times the country’s film industry. In the year to August 2007, IKEA, a Swedish furniture chain, sold over one million kitchens worldwide. The average budget for a “major” kitchen overhaul in 2006, calculates Remodeling magazine, was a staggering $ 54,000; even a “minor” improvement cost on average $ 18,000.
　　　Exclusivity, more familiar in the world of high fashion, has reached the kitchen: Robinson & Cornish, a British manufacturer of custom-made kitchens, offers a Georgian-style one which would cost￡145,000-155,000—excluding building, plumbing and electrical work. Its big selling point is that nobody else will have it: “You won’t see this kitchen anywhere else in the world.”
　　　The elevation of the room that once belonged only to the servants to that of design showcase for the modern family tells the story of a century of social change. Right into the early 20th century, kitchens were smoky, noisy places, generally located underground, or to the back of the house, and as far from living space as possible. That was as it should be: kitchens were for servants, and the aspiring middle classes wanted nothing to do with them.
　　　But as the working classes prospered and the servant shortage set in, housekeeping became a matter of interest to the educated classes. One of the pioneers of a radical new way of thinking about the kitchen was Catharine Esther Beecher, sister of Harriet Beecher Stowe. In American Woman’s Home, published in 1869, the Beecher sisters recommended a scientific approach to household management, designed to enhance the efficiency of a woman’s work and promote order.
　　　Many contemporary ideas about kitchen design can be traced back to another American, Christine Frederick, who set about enhancing the efficiency of the housewife. Her 1919 work, Household Engineering: Scientific Management in the Home, was based on detailed observation of a housewife’s daily routine. She borrowed the principle of efficiency on the factory floor and applied it to domestic tasks on the kitchen floor.
　　　Frederick’s central idea, that “stove, sink and kitchen table must be placed in such a relation that useless steps are avoided entirely”, inspired the first fully fitted kitchen, designed in the 1920s by Margarete Schütte-Lihotsky. It was a modernist triumph, and many elements remain central features of today’s kitchen.
51. What does the author say about the kitchen of today?
　　A) It is where housewives display their cooking skills.
　　B) It is where the family entertains important guests.
　　C) It has become something odd in a modern house.
　　D) It is regarded as the center of a modern home.
52. Why does the Georgian-style kitchen sell at a very high price?
　　A) It is believed to have tremendous artistic value.
　　B) No duplicate is to be found in any other place.
　　C) It is manufactured by a famous British company.
　　D) No other manufacturer can produce anything like it.
53. What does the change in the status of the kitchen reflect?
　　A) Improved living conditions.	
　　B) Women’s elevated status.	
　　C) Technological progress.
　　D) Social change.
54. What was the Beecher sisters’ idea of a kitchen?
　　A) A place where women could work more efficiently.
　　B) A place where high technology could be applied.
　　C) A place of interest to the educated people.
　　D) A place to experiment with new ideas.
55. What do we learn about today’s kitchen?
　　A) It represents the rapid technological advance in people’s daily life.
　　B) Many of its central features are no different from those of the 1920s.
　　C) It has been transformed beyond recognition.
　　D) Many of its functions have changed greatly.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　It is important that scientists be seen as normal people asking and answering important questions. Good, sound science depends on   26  , experiments and reasoned methodologies. It requires a willingness to ask new questions and try new approaches. It requires one to take risks and experience failures.  But good science also requires   27   understanding,clear explanation and concise presentation.
　　Our country needs more scientists who are willing to step out in the public   28   and offer their opinions on important matters. We need more scientists who can explain what they are doing in language that is  29  and understandable to the public. Those of us who are not scientists should also be prepared to support public engagement by scientists, and to 30  scientific knowledge into our public communications.
　　Too many people in this country, including some among our elected leadership, still do not understand how science works or why robust, long-range investments in research vitally matter. In the 1960s, the United States  31   nearly 17% of discretionary (可酌情支配的) spending to research and development,32   decades of economic growth. By 2008, the figure had fallen into the single   33    This occurs at a time when other nations have made significant gains in their own research capabilities.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once.Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Are We in an Innovation Lull?

[A] Scan the highlights of this year's Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ), and you may get a slight feeling of having seen them before. Many of the coolest gadgets this year are the same as the coolest gadgets last year--or the year before, even. The booths are still exciting, and the demos are still just as crazy. It is still easy to be dazzled by the display of drones (无人机),3D printers,virtual reality goggles ( 眼镜) and more "smart" devices than you could ever hope to catalog.Upon reflection, however, it is equally easy to feel like you have seen it all before. And it is hard not to think: Are we in an innovation lull ( 间歇期) ?

[B] In some ways, the answer is yes. For years, smartphones, televisions, tablets, laptops and desktops have made up a huge part of the market and driven innovation. But now these segments are looking at slower growth curves--or shrinking markets in some cases--as consumers are not as eager to spend money on new gadgets. Meanwhile, emerging technologies--the drones,3D printers and smart-home devices of the world--now seem a bit too old to be called "the next big thing. "

[C] Basically the tech industry seems to be in an awkward period now.  "There is not any one-hit wonder, and there will not be one for years to come," said Gary Shapiro, president and chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association (CTA). In his eyes, however, that doesn't necessarily mean that innovation has stopped. It has just grown up a little. "Many industries are going out of infancy and becoming adolescents," Shapiro said.

[D] For instance, new technologies that are building upon existing technology have not found their footing well enough to appeal to a mass audience, because, in many cases, they need to work effectively with other devices to realize their full appeal. Take the evolution of the smart home,for example. Companies are pushing it hard but make it almost overwhelming even to dip a toe in the water for the average consumer, because there are so many compatibility issues to think about. No average person wants to figure out whether their favorite calendar software works with their fridge or whether their washing machine and tablet get along. Having to install a different app for each smart appliance in your home is annoying; it would be nicer if you could manage everything together.  And while you may forgive your smartphone an occasional fault, you probably have less patience for error messages from your door lock.

[E] Companies are promoting their own standards, and the market has not had time to choose a winner yet as this is still very new. Companies that have long focused on hardware now have to think of ecosystems instead to give consumers practical solutions to their everyday problems."The dialogue is changing from what is technologically possible to what is technologically meaningful," said economist Shawn DuBravac. DuBravac works for CTA--which puts on the show each year--and said that this shift to a search for solutions has been noticeable as he researched his predictions for 2016.

[F] "So much of what CES has been about is the cool. It is about the flashiness and the gadgets," said John Curran, managing director of research at Accenture. "But over the last couple of years,and in this one in particular, we are starting to see companies shift from what is the largest screen size, the smallest form factor or the shiniest object and more into what all of these devices do that is practical in a consumer's life. " Even the technology press conferences, which have been high- profile in the past and reached a level of drama and theatrics fitting for a Las Vegas stage, have a different bent to them. Rather than just dazzling with a high cool factor, there is a focus on the practical. Fitbit, for example, released its first smartwatch Monday, selling with a clear purpose--to improve your fitness--and promoting it as a "tool, not a toy. " Not only that, it supports a number of platforms: Apple's iOS, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows phone.

[G] That seems to be what consumers are demanding, after all. Consumers are becoming increasingly bored with what companies have to offer: A survey of 28,000 consumers in 28 countries released by Accenture found consumers are not as excited about technology as they once were. For example, when asked whether they would buy a new smartphone this year, only 48 percent said yes--a six-point drop from 2015.

[H] And when it comes to the hyper-connected super-smart world that technology firms are painting for us, it seems that consumers are growing more uneasy about handing over the massive amounts of consumer data needed to provide the personalized, customized solutions that companies need to improve their services. That could be another explanation for why companies seem to be strengthening their talk of the practicality of their devices.

[I] Companies have already won part of the battle, having driven tech into every part of our lives, tracking our steps and our very heartbeats. Yet the persistent question of " Why do I need that?"--or, perhaps more tellingly, "Why do you need to know that?"--dogs the steps of many new ventures.  Only 13 percent of respondents said that they were interested in buying a smartwatch in 2016, for example--an increase of just one percent from the previous year despite a year of high-profile launches. That is bad news for any firm that may hope that smartwatches can make up ground for maturing smartphone and tablet markets. And the survey found flat demand for fitness monitors, smart thermostats (恒温器) and connected home cameras, as well.

[J] According to the survey, that lack of enthusiasm could stem from concerns about privacy and security. Even among people who have bought connected devices of some kind,37 percent said that they are going to be more cautions about using these devices and services in the future. A full 18 percent have even returned devices until they feel they can get safer guarantees against having their sensitive information hacked.

[K] That, too, explains the heavy Washington presence at this year's show, as these new technologies intrude upon heavily regulated areas. In addition to many senior officials from the Federal Trade and Federal Communications commissions, this year's list of policy makers also includes appearances from Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, to talk about smart cities, and Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Michael Huerta, to talk about drones.

[L] Curran, the Accenture analyst, said that increased government interest in the show makes sense as technology becomes a larger part of our lives. "There is an incompatibility in the rate at which these are advancing relative to the way we're digesting it," he said. "Technology is becoming bigger and more aspirational, and penetrating almost every aspect of our lives. We have to understand and think about the implications, and balance these great innovations with the potential downsides they naturally carry with them. "

36. Consumers are often hesitant to try smart-home devices because they are worried about compatibility problems.

37. This year's electronics show featured the presence of many officials from the federal government.

38. The market demand for electronic devices is now either declining or not growing as fast as before.

39. One analyst suggests it is necessary to accept both tlie positive and negative aspects of innovative products.

40. The Consumer Electronics Show in recent years has begun to focus more on the practical value than the showiness of electronic devices.

41. Fewer innovative products were found at this year's electronic products show.

42. Consumers are becoming more worried about giving personal information to tech companies to get customized products and services.

43. The Consumer Technology Association is the sponsor of the annual Consumer Electronics Show.

44. Many consumers wonder about the necessity of having their fitness monitored.

45. The electronic industry is maturing even though no wonder products hit the market.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　The Paris climate agreement finalised in December last year heralded a new era for climate action.For the first time, the world's nations agreed to keep global warming well below 2℃.
　　This is vital for climate-vulnerable nations. Fewer than 4% of countries are responsible for more than half of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. In a study published in Nature Scientific Reports, we reveal just how deep this injustice runs.
　　Developed nations such as Australia, the United States, Canada, and European countries are essentially climate "free-riders": causing the majority of the problems through high greenhouse gas emissions, while incurring few of the costs such as climate change's impact on food and water. In other words, a few countries are benefiting enormously from the consumption of fossil fuels, while at the same time contributing disproportionately to the global burden of climate change.
　　On the flip side, there are many "forced riders", who are suffering from the climate change impacts despite having scarcely contributed to the problem. Many of the world's most climate vulnerable countries, the majority of which are African or small island states, produce a very small quantity of emissions. This is much like a non-smoker getting cancer from second-hand smoke, while the heavy smoker is fortunate enough to smoke in good health.
　　The Paris agreement has been widely hailed as a positive step forward in addressing climate change for all, although the details on addressing "climate justice" can be best described as sketchy.
　　The goal of keeping global temperature rise "well below" 2~C is commendable but the emissions-reduction pledges submitted by countries leading up to the Paris talks are very unlikely to deliver on this.
　　More than $100 billion in funding has been put on the table for supporting developing nations to reduce emissions.  However, the agreement specifies that there is no formal distinction between developed and developing nations in their responsibility to cut emissions, effectively ignoring historical emissions. There is also very little detail on who will provide the funds or, importantly, who is responsible for their provision. Securing these funds, and establishing who is responsible for raising them will also be vital for the future of climate-vulnerable countries.
　　The most climate-vulnerable countries in the world have contributed very little to creating the global disease from which they now suffer the most. There must urgently be a meaningful mobilisation of the policies outlined in the agreement if we are to achieve national emissions reductions while helping the most vulnerable countries adapt to climate change.
　　And it is clearly up to the current generation of leaders from high-emitting nations to decide whether they want to be remembered as climate change tyrants or pioneers.

46. The author is critical of the Paris climate agreement because
A. it is unfair to those climate-vulnerable nations
B. it aims to keep temperature rise below 2℃ only
C. it is beneficial to only fewer than 4% of countries
D. it burdens developed countries with the sole responsibility

47. Why does the author call some developed countries climate "free-riders"?
A. They needn't worry about the food and water they consume.
B. They are better able to cope with the global climate change.
C. They hardly pay anything for the problems they have caused.
D. They are free from the greenhouse effects affecting "forced riders".

48. Why does the author compare the "forced riders" to second-hand smokers?
A. They have little responsibility for public health problems.
B. They are vulnerable to unhealthy environmental conditions.
C. They have to bear consequences they are not responsible for.
D. They are unaware of the potential risks they are confronting.

49. What does the author say about the $100 billion funding?
A. It will motivate all nations to reduce carbon emissions.
B. There is no final agreement on where it will come from.
C. There is no clarification of how the money will be spent.
D. It will effectively reduce greenhouse emissions worldwide.

50. what urgent action must be taken to realise the Paris climate agreement?
A. Encouraging high-emitting nations to take the initiative.
B. Calling on all the nations concerned to make joint efforts.
C. Pushing the current world leaders to come to a consensus.
D. Putting in effect the policies in the agreement at once.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Teenagers at risk of depression, anxiety and suicide often wear their troubles like a neon (霓虹灯)sign. Their risky behaviors--drinking too much alcohol, using illegal drugs, smoking cigarettes and skipping school--can alert parents and teachers that serious problems are brewing.
　　But a new study finds that there's another group of adolescents who are in nearly as much danger of experiencing the same psychiatric symptoms: teens who use tons of media, don't get enough sleep and have a sedentary (不爱活动的) lifestyle.
　　Of course, that may sound like a description of every teenager on the planet. But the study warns that it is teenagers who engage in all three of these practices in the extreme who are truly in jeopardy.Because their behaviors are not usually seen as a red flag, these young people have been dubbed the "invisible risk" group by the study's authors.
　　"In some ways they're at greater risk of falling through the cracks," says researcher Vladimir Carli. "While most parents, teachers and clinicians would react to an adolescent using drugs or getting drunk, they may easily overlook teenagers who are engaging in inconspicuous behaviors."
　　The study's authors surveyed 12,395 students and analyzed nine risk behaviors, including excessive alcohol use, illegal drug use, heavy smoking, high media use and truancy (逃学). Their aim was to determine the relationship between these risk behaviors and mental health issues in teenagers.
　　About 58% of the students demonstrated none or few of the risk behaviors. Some 13% scored high on all nine of the risk behaviors. And 29%, the "invisible risk" group, scored high on three in particular: They spent five hours a day or more on electronic devices. They slept six hours a night or less. And they neglected "other healthy activities."
　　The group that scored high on all nine of the risk behaviors was most likely to show symptoms of depression; in all, nearly 15% of this group reported being depressed, compared with just 4% of the low-risk group. But the invisible group wasn't far behind the high-risk set, with more than 13% of them exhibiting depression.
　　The findings caught Carli off guard. "We were very surprised," he says. "The high-risk group and low-risk group are obvious. But this third group was not only unexpected, it was so distinct and so large--nearly one third of our sample--that it became a key finding of the study. "
　　Carli says that one of the most significant things about his study is that it provides new early-warning signs for parents, teachers and mental health-care providers. And early identification, support and treatment for mental health issues, he says, are the best ways to keep them from turning into full-blown disorders.

51. What does the author mean by saying "Teenagers at risk of depression, anxiety and suicide often wear their troubles like a neon sign" (Lines 1 - 2, Para.1 ) ?
A. Mental problems can now be found in large numbers of teenagers.
B. Teenagers' mental problems are getting more and more attention.
C. Teenagers' mental problems are often too conspicuous not to be observed.
D. Depression and anxiety are the most common symptoms of mental problems.

52. What is the finding of the new study?
A. Teenagers' lifestyles have changed greatly in recent years.
B. Many teenagers resort to drugs or alcohol for mental relief.
C. Teenagers experiencing psychological problems tend to use a lot of media.
D. Many hitherto unobserved youngsters may have psychological problems.

53. Why do the researchers refer to teens who use tons of media, don't get enough sleep and have a sedentary lifestyle as the "invisible risk" group?
A. Their behaviors can be an invisible threat to society.
B. Their behaviors do not constitute a warning signal.
C. Their behaviors do not tend towards mental problems.
D. Their behaviors can be found in almost all teenagers on earth.

54. What does the new study find about the invisible group?
A. They are almost as liable to depression as the high-risk group.
B. They suffer from depression without showing any symptoms.
C. They do not often demonstrate risky behaviors as their peers.
D. They do not attract the media attention the high-risk group does.

55. What is the significance of Vladimir Carli's study?
A. It offers a new treatment for psychological problems among teenagers.
B. It provides new early-warning signals for identifying teens in trouble.
C. It may have found an ideal way to handle teenagers with behavioral problems.
D. It sheds new light on how unhealthy behaviors trigger mental health problems.

Part Ⅲ                 Reading Comprehension            (40 minutes)

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices.  Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　The tree people in the Lord of the Rings--the Ents--can get around by walking. But for real trees, it's harder to uproot. Because they're literally rooted into the ground, they are unable to leave and go 26 .
　　When a tree first starts growing in a certain area, it's likely that the   27   envelope—the temperature, humidity, rainfall patterns and so on--suits it. Otherwise, it would be unable to grow from a seedling. But as it  28, these conditions may change and the area around it may no longer be suitable for its  29  .
　　When that happens, many trees like walnuts, oaks and pines, rely  30  on so-called "scatter hoarders," such as birds, to move their seeds to new localities. Many birds like to store food for the winter, which they  31   retrieve.when the birds forget to retrieve their food--and they do sometimes--a seedling has a chance to grow. The bird Clark's nutcracker, for example, hides up to 100,000 seeds per year, up to 30 kilometers away from the seed source, and has a very close symbiotic (共生的) relationship with several pine species, most  32   the whitebark pine.
　　As trees outgrow their ideal  33  in the face of climate change, these flying ecosystem engineers could be a big help in  34   trees. It's a solution for us--getting birds to do the work is cheap and effective--and it could give  35   oaks and pines the option to truly "make like a tree and leave. "
　　

A. ages
B. breathing
C. climatic
D. elsewhere
E. exclusively
F. forever
G. fruitful
H. habitats

Section B
Directions : In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once.Each paragraph is marked with a letter.  Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

The American Workplace Is Broken. Here's How We Can Start Fixing It.

[A] Americans are working longer and harder hours than ever before.83% of workers say they're stressed about their jobs, nearly 50% say work-related stress is interfering with their sleep, and 60% use their smartphones to check in with work outside of normal working hours. No wonder only 13% of employees worldwide feel engaged in their occupation.

[B] Glimmers (少许) of hope, however, are beginning to emerge in this bruising environment: Americans are becoming aware of the toll their jobs take on them, and employers are exploring ways to alleviate the harmful effects of stress and overwork. Yet much more work remains to be done. To call stress an epidemic isn't exaggeration. The 83% of American employees who are stressed about their jobs--up from 73% just a year before--say that poor compensation and an unreasonable workload are their number-one sources of stress. And if you suspected that the workplace had gotten more stressful than it was just a few decades ago, you're right. Stress levels increased 18% for women and 24% for men from 1983 to 2009. Stress is also starting earlier in life, with some data suggesting that today's teens are even more stressed than adults.

[C] Stress is taking a significant toll on our health, and the collective public health cost may be enormous. Occupational stress increases the risk of heart attack and diabetes, accelerates the aging process, decreases longevity, and contributes to depression and anxiety, among numerous other negative health outcomes. Overall, stress-related health problems account for up to 90% of hospital visits, many of them preventable. Your job is "literally killing you," as The Washington Post put it. It's also hurting our relationships. Working parents say they feel stressed, tired, rushed and short on quality time with their children, friends and partners.

[D] Seven in 10 workers say they struggle to maintain work-life balance. As technology (and with it, work emails) seeps (渗入) into every aspect of our lives, work-life balance has become an almost meaningless term.  Add a rapidly changing economy and an uncertain future to this 24/7 connectivity, and you've got a recipe for overwork, according to Phyllis Moen. "There's rising work demand coupled with the insecurity of mergers, takeovers, downsizing and other factors," Moen said. "Part of the work-life issue has to talk about uncertainty about the future."

[E] These factors have converged to create an increasingly impossible situation with many employees overworking to the point of burnout. It's not only unsustainable for workers, but also for the companies that employ them. Science has shown a clear correlation between high stress levels in workers and absenteeism ( 旷工 ), reduced productivity, disengagement and high turnover. Too many workplace policies effectively prohibit employees from developing a healthy work-life balance by barring them from taking time off, even when they need it most.

[F] The U. S. trails far behind every wealthy nation and many developing ones that have family-friendly work policies including paid parental leave, paid sick days and breast-feeding support.according to a 2007 study. The U. S. is also the only advanced economy that does not guarantee workers paid vacation time, and it's one of only two countries in the world that does not offer guaranteed paid maternity leave. But even when employees are given paid time off, workplace norms and expectations that pressure them to overwork often prevent them from taking it. Fulltime employees who do have paid vacation days only use half of them on average.

[G] Our modern workplaces also operate based on outdated time constraints. The practice of clocking in for an eight-hour workday is a leftover from the days of the Industrial Revolution, as reflected in the then-popular saying, "Eight hours labor, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest."

[H] We've held on to this workday structure--but thanks to our digital devices, many employees never really clock out. Today, the average American spends 8.8 hours at work daily, and the majority of working professionals spend additional hours checking in with work during evenings, weekends and even vacations. The problem isn't the technology itself, but that the technology is being used to create more flexibility for the employer rather than the employee. In a competitive work environment, employers are able to use technology to demand more from their employees rather than motivating workers with flexibility that benefits them.

[I] In a study published last year, psychologists coined the term "workplace telepressure" to describe an employee's urge to immediately respond to emails and engage in obsessive thoughts about returning an email to one's boss, colleagues or clients. The researchers found that telepressure is a major cause of stress at work, which over time contributes to physical and mental burnout. Of the 300 employees participating in the study, those who experienced high levels of telepressure were more likely to agree with statements assessing burnout, like "I've no energy for going to work in the morning," and to report feeling fatigued and unfocused. Telepressure was also correlated with sleeping poorly and missing work.

[J] Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow explains that when people feel the pressure to be always "on," they fmd ways to accommodate that pressure, including altering their schedules, work habits and interactions with family and friends. Perlow calls this vicious cycle the "cycle of responsiveness" : Once bosses and colleagues experience an employee's increased responsiveness, they increase their demands on the employee's time. And because a failure to accept these increased demands indicates a lack of commitment to one's work, the employee complies.

[K] To address skyrocketing employee stress levels, many companies have implemented workplace wellness programs, partnering with health care providers that have created programs to promote employee health and well-being. Some research does suggest that these programs hold promise. A study of employees at health insurance provider Aetna revealed that roughly one quarter of those taking in-office yoga and mindfulness classes reported a 28% reduction in their stress levels and a 20% improvement in sleep quality. These less-stressed workers gained an average of 62 minutes per week of productivity. While yoga and meditation (静思) are scientifically proven to reduce stress levels, these programs do little to target the root causes of burnout and disengagement. The conditions creating the stress are long hours, unrealistic demands and deadlines, and work-life conflict.

[L] Moen and her colleagues may have found the solution. In a 2011 study, she investigated the effects of implementing a Results Only Work Environment (ROWE. on the productivity and well-being of employees at Best Buy's corporate headquarters.

[M] For the study,325 employees spent six months taking part in ROWE, while a control group of 334 employees continued with their normal workflow. The ROWE participants were allowed to freely determine when, where and how they worked--the only thing that mattered was that they got the job done. The results were striking. After six months, the employees who participated in ROWE reported reduced work-family conflict and a better sense of control of their time, and they were getting a full hour of extra sleep each night. The employees were less likely to leave their jobs, resulting in reduced turnover. It's important to note that the increased flexibility didn't encourage them to work around the clock. "They didn't work anywhere and all the time--they were better able to manage their work," Moen said. "Flexibility and control is key," she continued.

36. Workplace norms pressure employees to overwork, deterring them from taking paid time off.

37. The overwhelming majority of employees attribute their stress mainly to low pay and an excessive workload.

38. According to Moen, flexibility gives employees better control over their work and time.

39. Flexibility resulting from the use of digital devices benefits employers instead of employees.

40. Research finds that if employees suffer from high stress, they will be less motivated, less productive and more likely to quit.

41. In-office wellness programs may help reduce stress levels, but they are hardly an ultimate solution to the problem.

42. Health problems caused by stress in the workplace result in huge public health expenses.

43. If employees respond quickly to their job assignments, the employer is likely to demand more from them.

44. With technology everywhere in our life, it has become virtually impossible for most workers to keep a balance between work and life.

45. In America today, even teenagers suffer from stress, and their problem is even more serious than grown-ups'.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　Dr. Donald Sadoway at MIT started his own battery company with the hope of changing the world's energy future. It's a dramatic endorsement for a technology most people think about only when their smartphone goes dark. But Sadoway isn't alone in trumpeting energy storage as a missing link to a cleaner, more efficient, and more equitable energy future.
　　Scientists and engineers have long believed in the promise of batteries to change the world.Advanced batteries are moving out of specialized markets and creeping into the mainstream, signaling a tipping point for forward-looking technologies such as electric cars and rooftop solar propels.
　　The ubiquitous (无所不在的) battery has already come a long way, of course. For better or worse, batteries make possible our mobile-first lifestyles, our screen culture, our increasingly globalized world. Still, as impressive as all this is, it may be trivial compared with what comes next.Having already enabled a communications revolution, the battery is now poised to transform just about everything else.
　　The wireless age is expanding to include not just our phones, tablets, and laptops, but also our cars, homes, and even whole communities. In emerging economies, rural communities are bypassing the wires and wooden poles that spread power. Instead, some in Africa and Asia are seeing their first lightbulbs illuminated by the power of sunlight stored in batteries.
　　Today, energy storage is a $ 33 billion global industry that generates nearly 100 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year. By the end of the decade, it's expected to be worth over $ 50 billion and generate 160 gigawatt-hours, enough to attract the attention of major companies that might not otherwise be interested in a decidedly pedestrian technology. Even utility companies, which have long Viewed batteries and alternative forms of energy as a threat, are learning to embrace the technologies as enabling rather than disrupting.
　　Today's battery breakthroughs come as the. world looks to expand modern energy access to the billion or so people without it, while also cutting back on fuels that warm the planet.Those simultaneous challenges appear less overwhelming with increasingly better answers to a centuries-old question: how to make power portable.
　　To be sure, the battery still has a long way to go before the nightly recharge completely replaces the weekly trip to the gas station. A battery-powered world comes with its own risks, too. What happens to the centralized electric grid, which took decades and billions of dollars to build, as more and more people become "prosumers," who produce and consume their own energy onsite?
　　No one knows which--if any--battery technology will ultimately dominate, but one thing remains clear. The future of energy is in how we store it.
　　
46. What does Dr. Sadoway think of energy storage?
A. It involves the application of sophisticated technology.
B. It is the direction energy development should follow.
C. It will prove to be a profitable business.
D. It is a technology benefiting everyone.

47. What is most likely to happen when advanced batteries become widely used?
A. Mobile-first lifestyles will become popular.
B. The globalization process will be accelerated.
C. Communications will take more diverse forms.
D. The world will undergo revolutionary changes.

48. In some rural communities of emerging economies, people have begun to ___________.
A. find digital devices simply indispensable
B. communicate primarily by mobile phone
C. light their homes with stored solar energy
D. distribute power with wires and wooden poles

49. Utility companies have begun to realize that battery technologies ___________.
A. benefit their business
B. transmit power faster
C. promote innovation
D. encourage competition

50. What does the author imply about the centralized electric grid?
A. It might become a thing of the past.
B. It might turn out to be a "prosumer".
C. It will be easier to operate and maintain.
D. It will have to be completely transformed.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　More than 100 years ago, American sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois was concerned that race was being used as a biological explanation for what he understood to be social and cultural differences between different populations of people. He spoke out against the idea of "white" and "black" as distinct groups, claiming that these distinctions ignored the scope of human diversity.
　　Science would favor Du Bois. Today, the mainstream belief among scientists is that race is a social construct without biological meaning. In an article published in the journal Science, four scholars say racial categories need to be phased out. "Essentially, I could not agree more with the authors," said Svante Pääbo, a biologist and director of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany.  In one example that demonstrated genetic differences were not fixed along racial lines, the full genomes (基因组) of James Watson and Craig Venter, two famous American scientists of European ancestry, were compared to that of a Korean scientist, Seong-Jin Kim. It turned out that Watson and Venter shared fewer variations in their genetic sequences than they each shared with Kim.
　　Michael Yudell, a professor of public health at Drexel University in Philadelphia, said that modem genetics research is operating in a paradox: on the one hand, race is understood to be a useful tool to illuminate human genetic diversity, but on the other hand, race is also understood to be a poorly defined marker of that diversity.
　　Assumptions about genetic differences between people of different races could be particularly dangerous in a medical setting. "If you make clinical predictions based on somebody's race, you're going to be wrong a good chunk of the time," Yudell told Live Science. In the paper, he and his colleagues used the example of cystic fibrosis, which is underdiagnosed in people of African ancestry because it is thought of as a "white" disease.
　　So what other variables could be used if the racial concept is thrown out? Yudell said scientists need to get more specific with their language, perhaps using terms like "ancestry" or "population" that might more precisely reflect the relationship between humans and their genes, on both the individual and population level. The researchers also acknowledged that there are a few areas where race as a construct might still be useful in scientific research: as a political and social, but not biological, variable.
　　"While we argue phasing out racial terminology (术语) in the biological sciences, we also acknowledge that using race as a political or social category to study racism, although filled with lots of challenges,  remains  necessary  given  our need to  understand how  structural  inequities  and discrimination produce health disparities (差异) between groups. " Yudell said.
　　
51. Du Bois was opposed to the use of race as ________.
A. a basis for explaining human genetic diversity
B. an aid to understanding different populations
C. an explanation for social and cultural differences
D. a term to describe individual human characteristics

52. The study by Svante Pääbo served as an example to show ________.
A. modern genetics research is likely to fuel racial conflicts
B. race is a poorly defined marker of human genetic diversity
C. race as a biological term can explain human genetic diversity
D. genetics research should consider social and cultural variables

53. The example of the disease cystic fibrosis underdiagnosed in people of African ancestry demonstrates that ________.
A. it is absolutely necessary to put race aside in making diagnosis
B. it is important to include social variables in genetics research
C. racial categories for genetic diversity could lead to wrong clinical predictions
D. discrimination against black people may cause negligence in clinical treatment

54. What is Yudell's suggestion to scientists?
A. They be more precise with the language they use.
B. They refrain from using politically sensitive terms.
C. They throw out irrelevant concepts in their research.
D. They examine all possible variables in their research.

55. What can be inferred from Yudell's remark in the last paragraph?
A. Clinging to racism prolongs inequity and discrimination.
B. Physiological disparities are quite striking among races.
C. Doing away with racial discrimination is challenging.
D. Racial terms are still useful in certain fields of study.

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Countries Rush for Upper Hand in Antarctica

[A] On a glacier-filled island with fjords (峡湾) and elephant seals, Russia has built Antarctica's first Orthodox church on a hill overlooking its research base. Less than an hour away by snowmobile,Chinese labourers have updated the Great Wall Station, a vital part of China's plan to operate five bases on Antarctica, complete with an indoor badminton court and sleeping quarters for 150 people. Not to be outdone, India's futuristic new Bharathi base, built on stilts (桩子) using 134 interlocking shipping containers, resembles a spaceship. Turkey and Iran have announced plans to build bases, too.

[B] More than a century has passed since explorers raced to plant their flags at the bottom of the world, and for decades to come this continent is supposed to be protected as a scientific preserve,shielded from intrusions like military activities and mining. But an array of countries are rushing to assert greater influence here, with an eye not just towards the day those protective treaties expire,but also for the strategic and commercial opportunities that already exist.

[C] The newer players are stepping into what they view as a treasure house of resources. Some of the ventures focus on the Antarctic resources that are already up for grabs, like abundant sea life.South Korea, which operates state-of-the-art bases here, is increasing its fishing of krill (磷虾),found in abundance in the Southern Ocean, while Russia recently frustrated efforts to create one of the world's largest ocean sanctuaries here.

[D] Some scientists are examining the potential for harvesting icebergs from Antarctica, which is estimated to have the biggest reserves of fresh water on the planet. Nations are also pressing ahead with space research and satellite projects to expand their global navigation abilities.

[E] Building on a Soviet-era foothold, Russia is expanding its monitoring stations for Glonass, its version of the Global Positioning System (GPS). At least three Russian stations are already operating in Antarctica, part of its effort to challenge the dominance of the American GPS, and new stations are planned for sites like the Russian base, in the shadow of the Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity.

[F] Elsewhere in Antarctica, Russian researchers boast of their recent discovery of a freshwater reserve the size of Lake Ontario after drilling through miles of solid ice. "You can see that we're here to stay," said Vladimir Cheberdak,57, chief of the Bellingshausen Station, as he sipped tea under a portrait of Fabian Gottlieb yon Bellingshausen, a high-ranking officer in the Imperial Russian Navy who explored the Antarctic coast in 1820.

[G] Antarctica's mineral, oil and gas wealth are a longer-team prize. The treaty banning mining here, shielding coveted ( 令人垂涎的 ) reserves of iron ore, coal and chromium, comes up for review in 2048. Researchers recently found kimberlite (金伯利岩 ) deposits hinting at the existence of diamonds. And while assessments vary widely, geologists estimate that Antarctica holds at least 36 billion barrels of oil and natural gas.

[H] Beyond the Antarctic treaties, huge obstacles persist to tapping these resources, like drifting icebergs that could jeopardise offshore platforms. Then there is Antarctica's remoteness, with some mineral deposits found in windswept locations on a continent that is larger than Europe and where winter temperatures hover around minus 55 degrees Celsius.

[I] But advances in technology might make Antarctica a lot more accessible three decades from now.And even before then, scholars warn, the demand for resources in an energy-hungry world could raise pressure to renegotiate Antarctica's treaties, possibly allowing more commercial endeavours here well before the prohibitions against them expire. The research stations on King George Island offer a glimpse into the long game on this ice-blanketed continent as nations assert themselves, eroding the sway long held by countries like the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.

[J]Being stationed in Antarctica involves adapting to life on the planet's driest, windiest and coldest continent, yet each nation manages to make itself at home. Bearded Russian priests offer regular services at the Orthodox church for the 16 or so Russian speakers who spend the winter at the base, largely polar scientists in fields like glaciology and meteorology. Their number climbs to about 40 in the warmer summer months. China has arguably the fastest-growing operations in Antarctica. It opened its fourth station last year and is pressing ahead with plans to build a fifth. It is building its second ice-breaking ship and setting up research drilling operations on an ice dome13,422 feet above sea level that is one of the planet's coldest places. Chinese officials say the expansion in Antarctica prioritises scientific research, but they also acknowledge that concerns about "resource security" influence their moves.

[K] China's newly renovated Great Wall Station on King George Island makes the Russian and Chilean bases here seem outdated. "We do weather monitoring here and other research," Ning Xu,53, the chief of the Chinese base, said over tea during a fierce blizzard (baofengxuE. in late November.The large base he leads resembles a snowed-in college campus on holiday break, with the capacity to sleep more than 10 times the 13 people who were staying on through the Antarctic winter.Yong Yu, a Chinese microbiologist, showed off the spacious building, with empty desks under an illustrated timeline detailing the rapid growth of China's Antarctic operations since the 1980s. "We now feel equipped to grow," he said.

[L] As some countries expand operations in Antarctica, the United States maintains three year-round stations on the continent with more than 1,000 people during the southern hemisphere's summer, including those at the Amundsen-Scott station, built in 1956 at an elevation of 9,301 feet on a plateau at the South Pole. But US researchers quietly complain about budget restraints and having far fewer icebreakers than Russia, limiting the reach of the United States in Antarctica.

[M] Scholars warn that Antarctica's political drift could blur the distinction between military and civilian activities long before the continent's treaties come up for renegotiation, especially in parts of Antarctica that are ideal for intercepting (拦截) signals from satellites or retasking satellite systems, potentially enhancing global electronic intelligence operations.

[N] Some countries have had a hard time here. Brazil opened a research station in 1984, but it was largely destroyed by a fire that killed two members of the navy in 2012, the same year that a diesel-laden Brazilian barge sank near the base. As if that were not enough, a Brazilian C-130 Hercules military transport plane has remained stranded near the runway of Chile's air base here since it crash-landed in 2014.

[O] However, Brazil's stretch of misfortune has created opportunities for China, with a Chinese company winning the $100 million contract in 2015 to rebuild the Brazilian station.

[P] Amid all the changes, Antarctica maintains its allure. South Korea opened its second Antarctic research base in 2014, describing it as a way to test robots developed by Korean researchers for use in extreme conditions. With Russia's help, Belarus is preparing to build its first Antarctic base. Colombia said this year that it planned to join other South American nations with bases in Antarctica.

[Q] "The old days of the Antarctic being dominated by the interests and wishes of white men from European, Australasian and North American states are over," said Klaus Dodds, a politics scholar at the University of London who specialises in Antarctica.  "The reality is that Antarctica is geopolitically contested."

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　Any veteran nicotine addict will testify that fancy packaging plays no role in the decision to keep smoking. So, it is argued, stripping cartons of their branding will trigger no mass movement to quit.
　　But that isn't why the government--under pressure from cancer charities, health workers and the Labour party--has agreed to legislate for standardised packaging. The theory is that smoking should be stripped of any appeal to discourage new generations from starting in the first place. Plain packaging would be another step in the reclassification of cigarettes from inviting consumer products to narcotics (麻醉剂).
　　Naturally, the tobacco industry is violently opposed. No business likes to admit that it sells addictive poison as a lifestyle choice. That is why government has historically intervened, banning advertising, imposing health warnings and punitive ( 惩罚性的) duties. This approach has led over time to a fall in smoking with numbers having roughly halved since the 1970s. Evidence from Australia suggests plain packaging pushes society further along that road. Since tobacco is one of the biggest causes of premature death in the UK, a measure that tames the habit even by a fraction is worth trying.
　　So why has it taken so long? The Department of Health declared its intention to consider the move in November 2010 and consulted through 2012. But the plan was suspended in July 2013. It did not escape notice that a lobbying firm set up by Lynton Crosby, David Cameron's election campaign director, had previously acted for Philip Morris International. (The prime minister denied there was a connection between his new adviser's outside interests and the change in legislative programme.) In November 2013, after an unnecessary round of additional consultation, health minister Jane Ellison said the government was minded to proceed after all. Now we are told Members of Parliament (MPs) will have a free vote before parliament is dissolved in March.
　　Parliament has in fact already authorised the government to tame the tobacco trade. MPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of Labour amendments to the children and families bill last February that included the power to regulate for plain packaging. With sufficient will in Downing Street this would have been done already. But strength of will is the missing ingredient where Mr. Cameron and public health are concerned. His attitude to state intervention has looked confused ever since his bizarre 2006 lament (叹惜) that chocolate oranges placed seductively at supermarket checkouts fueled obesity.
　　The government has moved reluctantly into a sensible public health policy, but with such obvious over-cautiousness that any political credit due belongs to the opposition. Without sustained external pressure it seems certain Mr. Cameron would still be hooked on the interests of big tobacco companies.

46. What do chain smokers think of cigarette packaging?
A. Fancy packaging can help to engage new smokers.
B. It has little to do with the quality or taste of cigarettes.
C. Plain packaging discourages non-smokers from taking up smoking.
D. It has little impact on their decision whether or not to quit smoking.

47. What has the UK government agreed to do concerning tobacco packaging?
A. Pass a law to standardise cigarette packaging.
B. Rid cigarette cartons of all advertisements.
C. Subsidise companies to adopt plain packaging.
D. Reclassify cigarettes according to packaging.

48. What has happened in Australia where plain packaging is implemented?
A. Premature death rates resulting from smoking have declined.
B. The number of smokers has dropped more sharply than in the UK.
C. The sales of tobacco substitutes have increased considerably.
D. Cigarette sales have been falling far more quickly than in the UK.

49. Why has it taken so long for the UK government to consider plain packaging?
A. Prime Minister Cameron has been reluctant to take action.
B. There is strong opposition from veteran nicotine addicts.
C. Many Members of Parliament are addicted to smoking.
D. Pressure from tobacco manufacturers remains strong.

50. What did Cameron say about chocolate oranges at supermarket checkouts?
A. They fueled a lot of controversy.
B. They attracted a lot of smokers.
C. They made more British people obese.
D. They had certain ingredients missing.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　What a waste of money! In return for an average of ~44,000 of debt, students get an average of only 14 hours of lecture and tutorial time a week in Britain. Annual fees have risen from ￡1,000 to ￡9,000 in the last decade, but contact time at university has barely risen at all. And graduating doesn't even provide any guarantee of a decent job : six in ten graduates today are in non-graduate jobs.
　　No wonder it has become fashionable to denounce many universities as little more than elaborate con-tricks (骗术). There's a lot for students to complain about: the repayment threshold for paying back loans will be frozen for five years, meaning that lower-paid graduates have to start repaying their loans; and maintenance grants have been replaced by loans, meaning that students from poorer backgrounds face higher debt than those with wealthier parents.
　　Yet it still pays to go to university. If going to university doesn't work out, students pay very little--if any--of their tuition fees back: you only start repaying when you are earning ￡21,000 a year.
　　Almost half of graduates--those who go on to earn less--will have a portion of their debt written off.
　　It's not just the lectures and tutorials that are important. Education is the sum of what students teach each other in between lectures and seminars. Students do not merely benefit while at university; studies show- they go on to be healthier and happier than non-graduates, and also far more likely to vote.
　　Whatever your talents, it is extraordinarily difficult to get a leading job in most fields without having been to university. Recruiters circle elite universities like vultures (兀鹰). Many top firms will not even look at applications from those who lack a 2.1, i. e., an upper-second class degree, from an elite university. Students at university also meet those likely to be in leading jobs in the future, forming contacts for life. This might not be right, but school-leavers who fail to acknowledge as much risk making the wrong decision about going to university.
　　Perhaps the reason why so many universities offer their students so little is they know studying at a top university remains a brilliant investment even if you don't learn anything. Studying at university will only become less attractive if employers shift their focus away from where someone went to university--and there is no sign of that happening anytime soon. Schoololeavers may moan, but they have little choice but to embrace university and the student debt that comes with it.

51. What is the author's opinion of going to university?
A. It is worthwhile after all.
B. It is simply a waste of time.
C. It is hard to say whether it is good or bad.
D. It is too expensive for most young people.

52. What does the author say about the employment situation of British university graduates?
A. Few of them are satisfied with the jobs they are offered.
B. It usually takes a long time for them to find a decent job.
C. Graduates from elite universities usually can get decent jobs.
D. Most of them take jobs which don't require a college degree.

53. What does the author say is important for university students besides classroom instruction?
A. Making sure to obtain an upper-second class degree.
B. Practical skills they will need in their future careers.
C. Interactions among themselves outside the classroom.
D. Developing independent and creative thinking abilities.

54. What is said to be an advantage of going to university?
A. Learning how to take risks in an ever-changing world.
B. Meeting people who will be helpful to you in the future.
C. Having opportunities of playing a leading role in society.
D. Gaining up-to-date knowledge in science and technology.

55. What can we infer from the last paragraph?
A. It is natural for students to make complaints about university education.
B. Few students are willing to bear the burden of debt incurred at university.
C. University education is becoming attractive to students who can afford it.
D. The prestige of the university influences employers' recruitment decisions.

The most importantfactor, for the majority ofthe people interviewed,  was 1Bhaving friendly,  supportive colleagues.   In fact,  2D73%  people interviewed puttheir relationship with colleagues as the key factor contributing to happiness at work, which is a very high percentage.

1— W : Mr.  De keyzer, Iam a great lover of your book,  MomentsBeforetheFlood.  canyoutellushow you firstbecameinterestedin thissubjectmatter?
2— M : In2006,  when the concert hall of the city of Bruges asked me to 6ctake some pictures for a catalogue for a new concert season around the themeofwater, I foundmyselfworkingalongthe Belgian coastline.   As there had been numerous alarming articles in the press about a climate catastrophewaiting to happen, I started looking atthesea and thebeach verydifferently, a place where I spent so many perfect days as a child.   This fearofaloomingdangerbecamethesubject of5Da large-scalephoto project.
3— W : You wrotein the book “I don,twantto photograph the disaster;  I want to photograph the disaster waitingto happen. ”can you talk abitaboutthat?
4— M : Itis clearnow that7A it,sa matteroftime before the entire European coastline disappears under water.  The same goes for numerous big cities around the world.    My idea was to photograph thisbeautiful and very unique coastline, rich in history, beforeit,s too late- as a lastwitness.
5— W : can you talk abitabouthow historyplaysarole in this project?
6— M : sure.  The project is also about the history of Europe looking at the sea and wondering when the next enemy would appear.   In the images,  you   see   all   kinds   of   possible   defense constructions   to   hold   back   the   Romans,  Germans,  vikings,  and now nature as enemy number one.  Forexample, thereisthe imageof the bridge into thesea taken at the Normandy D-Day landing  site.    Also,   venice,  the city eternally threatened by thesea, 8Dwhere every morning wooden pathways have to be set up to allow touriststo reach theirhotels.

　　　[技巧补充] 本题考查开篇所提作品的属性/内容 ,属于整体感知类题目 ,此类题目解题线索通常不  止一处 ,应抓住文中提示正确答案的蛛丝马迹 。本题最直接的解题线索 为 2 段末句 a large-scale photo project,但即使错过此信息 ,根据之后女士在问题中提到的 photograph the disasterwaiting to happen以  及男士在回答中提到的 photograph this beautiful and very unique coastline也可以推断出正确答案 。

　　　	I when facing anew situation, somepeople tend to 9crehearse their defeat by spending too much time anticipating the worst.    I remember talking with  a young lawyer who was about to begin her first jury trial.  she was very nervous.  I asked what impression she wanted to make on thejury.  she replied, “I don,t wantto look too inexperienced; I don,t want them to suspectthis is myfirsttrial. ”
　　　Ⅱ  This lawyer had fallen victim  to the “don,ts” syndrome, aform ofnegativegoalsetting.  The“don,ts”can   be self-fulfilling because your mind responds to pictures.     Research conducted at stanford university shows 10Da   mental image fires the nervous system  the same way as   actuallydoing something.  That means when a golfer tells   himself“Don,thittheballintothewater,”hismindseesthe   imageoftheballflyinginto thewater. so guesswhere the   ballwillgo.  Consequently, before going into any stressful   situation, 11cfocusonlyonwhatyouwanttohavehappen.

A) 预想可能出现的问题 。	C) 想象他们自己获得成功 。

　　　[答案精析] C) o  A) 恰恰是“不要做 ”综合征的表现 ,是需要避免的 。B) 主观臆断 “列清单 ”,文中未  提及 。C) 是对 Ⅱ段末建议 focus only on whatyou wantto have happen的同义改写 。 D) 源于 Ⅲ段 look professional and self-assured,但这是新人律师对自己的期望 ,而非作者给出的一般性建议 。
　　　[ 技巧补充] 新人律师的情况是“不要做 ”综合征的实例 ,故本题亦可通过下文对他的指导解题 :说 明者引导其做出具体的积极想象(庭审中的体态 、音量 、陈词等等) 。 由此可知 ,应对 “不要做 ”综合征的 思路是用正面想象取代负面想象 , 即想象自己成功 。

[答案精析] B) o  A) 错将结尾处的 positive dress rehearsal(积极预演) 误解为 “名牌连衣裙 ”。B) 符
合文末律师参加判决的结局 did win(确实赢了) 。 C) 、D) 均源于 Ⅲ段律师的设想 , 但庭审胜利的结果 (did win) 暗示其表现与正面想象 一 致 , C) “音量不够 ”恰恰相反 , D) 的积极导向正确 , 但 “自信地走动 (moving confidently) ”≠“展示动态图 ”。

13. Its long-term effects、Itshealthbenefits、Ithelpspeople、Itenablespatients提示本题关乎某事对

　健康的影响 ,其中后两项“肯定该影响 ”,而前两项 yetto be improved、overestimated提示 “谨慎怀疑/否 定该影响 ”的大方向 , 听时应着重留意开篇对 It指代对象的定性说明 。
　　　14. 谓语 focused/tracked 暗示主语 It指代某项研究 ,theirdifference from men暗示 they指代女性 , 推测题干询问某项以女性为对象的研究 。
　　　15. 各项主语都为 Fiber,谓语 help, improve, 宾语 benefits都含 “(对健康的) 助益 ”之意 ,推测题干 询问膳食纤维对健康的益处 。
　　　结合对 13、15题的分析 ,13题的 “某种事物 ”要 么 指代膳食纤维 , 题目直接考查其益处 , 要么指代 “与健康相关的引 子 事 物 ”, 题目考查其局限性 , 反衬膳食纤维对健康的价值 。 14题结合  13题 c 的 breastcancer提示文章着重从“女性 ”切入探讨膳食纤维的益处 , 听到“有关女性的实验 ”时 ,应格外留意 实验内容 、方式 、结论等信息 。
　　　[看选项复现词预测主题] 选项中的高频词集中于两类 :一 、与饮食(具体为食物偏好 、纤维摄入) 有 关的名词 food preferences, fiber intake, eating habits, fiber。 二 、表 “助益 ”的动词 help(s) , enables, improve,名词 benefits。 由此推测本文谈及“饮食习惯对健康的影响(膳食纤维对健康的益处) ”。
　

　　　	I   Most  Americans  don,t  eat  enough  fruits,  vegetablesorwhole grains.  Research now saysaddingfiber to the teendietmay13chelplowertherisk ofbreastcancer.
　　　Ⅱ  conversations about the benefits of fiber are probably more common in nursing homes than high schools.  Butalong comes a new study that could change that.  kristi king, a diet specialist at Texas children,s Hospitalfinds it,shard to getteenager patients, attention abouthealthy eating but telling them that eating lots of high-fiber foods could reduce the risk of breast cancer beforemiddleage.  That,sa powerfulmessage.
　　　Ⅲ The new finding is based on a study of44,000 women.  They were surveyed abouttheir14Ddietsduring highschool, andtheireatinghabitsweretrackedfortwo decades.   It turns out that those 13cwho consumed the highest levels of fiber during adolescence had a lower risk of developing breast cancer,  compared to  the women who ate the least fiber.  This important study demonstrates that13cthemore fiberyou eatduringyour highschoolyears, the lower your risk is in developing breastcancerin later life.
　　　Ⅳ  The finding points to long-standing evidence that 15A   fiber may reduce circulating female hormone levels,   which  could explain the reduced risk.   The bottom line here is 15A the more fiber you eat, perhaps,  a lowerlevelofhormonein yourbody, and therefore, a lower lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.  High- fiber diets are also linked to a reduced risk of heart diseaseanddiabetes.  That,s whywomen are told to eat 25 gramsa fiberaday-men even more.

　　　	I   Well,   my  current  research  is  really  about 16Bconsumer behavior.  so recently I,ve looked at 16cyoung people,s drinking and it,s obviously a major concern to governmentatthe moment.   I,ve also looked athow older peopleare represented in the media.  Again, it,s of major currentinterestwith olderpeoplebecoming amuch larger proportion of Uk,  and indeed,  world society.   I,m also interested in how consumers operate online and how that online behavior might be different from how they operate offline when theygoto the shops.


Ⅱ  well, I think that the important thing here is to
　actually understand what,s happening from the consumers, perspective.  one ofthe things that businesses and indeed governmentorganizations often fail to do is to really see what is happening from the consumers, perspective.   For example, in thecaseofyoungpeople,sdrinking, oneofthe things that I,ve identified is that 17D drinking for people,  say, between the ages of18 and24 is allaboutthe social activity.  A lot of the government advertising has been aboutindividualresponsibility, butactually understanding thatdrinking is 17D  very much aboutthe social activity and finding ways to help youngpeople gethome safely and not end up in hospitalis one ofthe things that we,ve tried to presentthere.
　　　Ⅲ Thekeything aboutconsumerbehavioristhatit,s very much abouthow consumers change.  Markets always change faster than marketing, so wehave to look atwhat consumers aredoing.  currentlyIteach consumerbehavior to undergraduates in their second year and we look at all kinds of things in consumerbehaviorand particularlyhow  consumers are presented in  advertising.   So  they get involved by looking at advertising and really critically assessing the consumer behavior aspects of it and getting involved,    sometimes   doing   primary   research.      For example,last year 18Amy students spent a week looking at their own  purchasing  and  analysed  it  in  detail  from  shopping to the relationship that they have with their retailbanks andtheirmobile phoneproviders.  Ithink they found it very useful and it also helped them identify just whatkind ofbudgetstheyhad too.  The factofthe matter is thatthere is a whole range of interesting research out there.  AndIthink as the yearsgoon, thereisgoingto be much more forusto considerand certainlymuch morefor students to become involved in.

　　　22. 四项以方式状语形式出现 ,putting/drawing money、limiting. . . spending、refusing to buy涉及存 钱 、花钱 ,故推测题干询问跟金钱有关的行为方式 。
　　　[看选项复现词预测主题] 选项中的高频词集中于两类 :一 、与金钱 ,尤其是纸 币 相 关 的 名 词 dirty/ papermoney、physicalcurrency、cash、papermoney/currency;二 、“无纸币及其影响 ”相关的表达 :do away with、use creditcards、give up、the absence of、causes. . . to/going to affect;三 、金钱使用方式相关的短语  acceptcash only、putting/drawingmoney、limiting. . . spending、refusingto buyanythingon credit,综合推  断本文着重探讨“无纸币对生活 、消费行为的影响 ”。


　　　	I Sweden was the firstEuropean country to print and use paper money, but it may 19D  soon do away with physicalcurrencies.  Banks can save a lot of money and avoid regulatory headaches by moving to a cash-free system ,   and they can  also 19B avoid bank robberies,  theft, and dirty money.
　　　Ⅱ  Claer Barrett,  the editor of FinancialTimes Money,   says the western world is headed toward a world without physical currency.   “Andy Holder—the chief economistatTheBank ofEngland—suggested that the Uk  move  towards  a  government-backed  digital currency.  But does a cashless society really make good economic sense? “The factthatcashisbeingdrawn out of society, is less a feature of our everyday lives, and the ease of electronic payments—is this actually making usspend moremoney withoutrealizing it?”
　　　Ⅲ Barrett wanted to 20c  find out ifthe absence of physical currency does indeed cause a person to spend more, so she decided to conduct an experiment a few  months ago.  she decided that she was going to try to justusecash for two weeks to make allofher essential purchases and see whatthat would do to her spending.   she found she did spend a lot less money because it is incredibly20Bhard to predicthow much cash one is going to need — she was forever drawing money out of cash points.  Months later, she was stillfinding cash stuffed in hertrouserpockets and the pocketsofherhandbags.


　　　Ⅳ  During the experiment,  Barrett took a train ride.  on the way, there was an announcementthatthe 21crestaurantcarwasnotcurrentlyacceptingcreditcards.   The train cars were filled with groansbecause many of the passengerswere travelingwithoutcash.
　　　V  “It underlines just how  much  things  have changed in the last generation,” Barrett says.   “My parents, when they were younger, used to 22Abudgetby puttingmoneyintoenvelopes—they,d getpaid andthey,d immediately separatethe cash into pilesand putthem in envelopes, so theyknew whattheyhad to spendweekby week.  Itwasavery effectivewayforthem to keep track of their spending.
　　　Ⅵ  Nowadays,  we,re all on  credit cards,  we,re doing online purchases, and money is kind ofbecoming a lessphysicalandmoreimaginarytypeofthing thatwe can,t getourhands around. ”

[看选项关键词预测问题及听音重点]
　　　23. 各项中心词 explosion、hunger、extinction、deterioration都带有明显的负面色彩 ,故推测本题关 于“某问题/坏处/负面影响 ”;限定词 population、of rare species、Environmental提示问题焦点:人口 (膨 胀 、饥荒)、物种(灭绝)、环境(污染) ,开篇应注意识别全文聚焦哪项 。

I  Why should you consider taking a course in
　demographyin college? You willbe growing up in the generation where the baby boomers are going into retirement and dying.   You will face problems in the aging of the population that have never been faced before.  You will hear more and more about migration between countries, and between rural areas and cities.   You need to understand as a citizen and as a taxpayer and as a voterwhat,s really behind the arguments.
　　　Ⅱ I want to tell you about the past, present and future ofthehuman population, so let,s startwith afew  problems.  Rightnow, a billion people are23Bchronically hungry.  That means they wake up hungry,  they are hungry allday and they go to sleep hungry.  A billion people are living in slums, notthe same billion people,  butthere is some overlap.  Living in slums means they don,t have infrastructure to take the garbage away.   Theydon,thave secure water supplies to drink.  Nearly a billion people are illiterate.  Try to imagine your life being illiterate.  You can,treadthe labels on thebottlesin the supermarket, if you can get to a supermarket.  Two  thirds of those people who are illiterate are women and about200to250million women don,thave access to birth control they want so that they can control their own fertility.   This  is  not  only  a  problem   in  developing countries;  24Babout half of all pregnancies globally  are unintended.  So thoseareexamplesofpopulation problems.


　　　Ⅲ Demography gives you the tools to understand and to addresstheseproblems.  It,snotonlythestudyof human population,  but the populations of non-human species, including viruses, like influenza, thebacteriain your gut, plantsthatyou eat, animals thatyou enjoyor thatprovide you with meat.

26.  答案:L) significant
【确定词性】 由空格所在位置 made no             gains可推测其为名词 gains的修饰成分 ,可能为 “形
　容词 、ing分词 、ed分词或名词 ”, 可选范围 : C) demanding、D) doubtful、G) monopolized、H) outcome、I) predominance、J) presuming、K)reputation、L)significant、O) standardized。
【锁定答案】空格所在句指出“两年前研究显示 ,三分之一以上的学生在大学就 读 期 间 ,并没有在心

智能力方面取得              进步 ”, 空格词应能说明 “进步 (gains) ”的性质 、程度等 。 可选范围中只有 significant符合要求 ,made significantgains意为“收获/进步程度很大 ”。
　　【点拨技巧】①②句以时间照应 (in2013. . . Two years before. . . )、关键词回指 (critical thinking skills. . . such mentalabilities)及动词呼应(ask. . . to prove. . . . haveactually achieved importantgoals与  had shown. . . . had made no        gains)形成倒叙结构 ,传递因果逻辑 :校长如今要求教师证明自己的  学生达到了目标 ,是因为两年前的调查表明很大一部分学生没有 取 得               进展 。很容易判断空格词  为“正向词(令人满意的 ,巨大的等) ”。
27. 答案:F) justify
　　【确定词性】空格位于 needed to之后 、名词词组 the high cost之前 ,故应填入 动词原形 ,可选范围 : B)confirm、F)justify、M)signify。
　　【锁定答案】空格句指出 ,Daniels先生(普渡大学校长)需要向学生和家长               就读大学的高昂成 本 。随后则以 After all(毕竟 ,终究) 引出背景 :越来越多的美国人认为读大学不重要 。可见 ,justify“证 明……是合理的 ,为……辩护 ”符合语义要 求 :(鉴于当前情形) Daniels有必要为大学教育 、为普渡大学 的高昂学费“正名 ”。
　　　confirm“确认 ”单看语义可与 thehigh cost搭配 ,但上下文没有提及学生和家长“不清楚学费问题 ”,因 而不存在校长向他们“进行确认 ”的必要性 ,而且 “与某人确认某事 ”用 with sb而不是 to sb。signify符合 signify sth to sb结构要求 ,但该词后接“某人的感觉 、意见等(如 signifyhisdissatisfaction to them) ”。
　　【点拨技巧】逻辑词(yet, however, despite等表示转折/反向关系 ;because, given, after all等表示顺 接/同向关系)是推断空格语义的重要依据 。如本题 ,由 Afterall可知 ④句解释 ③句的背景原因 ,两句逻 辑关系为 :(因为)公众不理解 、信任度下降 — 所以校长需“正名 ”、证明其必要性 ,从而确定选 justify。
28. 答案:E) drastically
　　【确定词性】空格所在句为完整的主谓结构(the percentage. . . has fallen        ) ,所以空格处应填 入副词 ,修饰不及物动词 fallen,可选范围 :A)accurately、E)drastically、N)simultaneously。
　　【锁定答案】空格词修饰“比例下降(the percentage. . . hasfallen) ”,应能说明下降的“程度 、幅度或速 度 ”,drastically“急剧地 ”符合此语义要求 。
　　　accurately“精确地 ”不能与 fallen搭配 。simultaneously“同步地 、同时地 ”单看语义可以和 fallen搭 配 ,用以说明“两个或多个下降趋势同时发生 ”,但上文中并未提及其他下降变化 。

29. 答案:D) doubtful
【确定词性】空格位于系动词 remain之后 ,从句引导词 that之前 ,可判断空格填入 “形容词 、ing分
词或  ed 分 词 ”作 表 语 , 可 选 范  围 : C) demanding、D) doubtful、G) monopolized、J) presuming、O) standardized。
　　【锁定答案】由 the faculty remain   29  that. . . 结构可知空格处应填入能表现教师们 “心理活动 、 心理状态 ”的词语 。该段 ①句指出 “普渡大学正推行 一 项测 试 ,评估学生的批判性思维能力 ”; ②句(空   格所在句) 以 yet引发转折 ,暗示教师们对此有不同看法 ; ③句再次转折(However)指出 “教师们不必如   此担心(need not worry so much) ”。据此可推断 , ②句中教师们的状态与 “担心 ”相近 ,可选范围中   doubtful“怀疑的 ”符合语义要求 。
　　　demanding用作形容词 时 意 为 “要求高的 ”,能用于修饰 faculty,但和下文的 “不必如此 担 心(need  notworry so much) ”无法衔 接 。monopolized“被垄断的 ”、presuming“推测的 ”、standardized“标准化 的 ” 与 faculty不搭配 。
　　【点拨技巧】so/such、this/that/these/those等的回指功能是解题的重要线索 。如本题 , 由后文 worry so much很容易反推空格词与“担忧 ”语义相近 。
　　【补充语法】系动词 十表示心理状态/精神作用的形容词  (或 ed分词) 在语法上相当 于 一 个 及 物 动 词 ,后面可跟 that引导的宾语从句 。如 :Heappeared surprisedthatIrefusedhisinvitation. (他似乎很惊 讶我拒绝了他的邀请 。)
30. 答案:H) outcome
　　【确定词 性】由 . . . can be measured by a “learning        ”可 推 断 空 格 处 应 为 单 数 可 数 名 词 (learning为其修饰成分) ,可选范围 :H)outcome、K)reputation。
补充:从语法角度看 ,ing分词也可充当名词 ,但由于其兼有动词特征且往往不可数 ,故先不考虑 。
　　【锁定答案】由紧跟空格所在词 组 的 such as结构举出的例子 a graduate,s ability to investigate and reason(毕业生的探究和推理能力) 可判断空格词从语义上包含 “能力 ”,outcome“结果 ,成果 ”符合该语  义 :“探究和推理能力 ”属于一项“学习成果 ”。
31. 答案:O) standardized
　　【确定词性】由空格所在位置 can use        metrics to measure. . . 可推断其为名词 metrics的修饰 成分 ,可 能 是 “形 容 词、ing 分 词、ed 分 词 或 名 词 ”, 可 选 范  围 : C) demanding、G) monopolized、I) predominance、J)presuming、K)reputation、O)standardized。
　　【锁定答案】空格所在句及上下文均未描述 metrics特征 ,故只能将可选范围的词代入空格 ,看是否   符合语义逻辑 。standardized可和 metrics搭配 ,且“标准化指标 ”强调衡量学生表现的标准统一 、具有可   比性 ,可契 合上文 “老师们不必如此担心 , 教 育 者的工作可通过学生学习的成果来 (有效) 衡量 。 demanding作形容词 ,意为“要求 严 格 的 ”或 “费时费力的 ”,一 般用于修饰 “人 ”或 “工作 ”, 不用于修饰

metrics。
　　【点拨技巧】选择名词的“修饰成分 ”时可有两种解题思路 :1. 如果上下文中有对中心词特征的描 述 ,则概括这些信息然后对比选项 ,最契合的即为 答 案 ;2. 如果上下文中没有直接的描述性信息 ,则将 词性合适的备选项试着带入空格 ,从两个标准进行判断 : ①是否能够修饰中心词 , ②是否符合上下文语 境及暗含的逻辑关系(如本题)。

32. 答案:B) confirm
　　【确定词性】空格所在句的主语为 the actual results, 带有 and连接的两个并列谓语 :第一个为系表 结构 are worrisome,第二个为 mostly        earlier studies。可推断空格应为 及物动词的原形 ,可选范 围 :B)confirm、M)signify。
　　【锁定答案】可选范围中 ,语义上能和 earlier studies搭配的只有 confirm,即 :当前实验结果证实了 先前的研究 。signify“表示 ,意味着 ”不能和 studies搭配 。
　　　【点拨技巧】纵览文章可发现 ,the actual results主要指本段 ②③句实验结论 :在即将毕业的学生中 , “拥有高水平批判思维能力者 ”远少于“拥有高水平书面交流和数理能力者 ”。而 earlier studies应包括 首段 ②句所提及的两年前研究发现 :很大一部分学生大学期间心智能力并未取得显 著 提 升 。 比对可发 现 :如今实验验证了先前的研究 。

33. 答案:K)reputation
　　【确定词性】“theirglobal        ”整体作介词 despite的宾语 ,为 “物主代词 their十名词 ”结构 ,所以 空格词为 “名词或  ing分词 ”(global为 其 修 饰 成 分 ) , 可 选 范 围 : C) demanding、I) predominance、J) presuming、K)reputation。
　　【锁定答案】首先看空格所在短语(despite. . . )大意 :美国大学凭借优异的教学在全球             。 随后 看整句主句(与空格所在短语为 转 折/反向关系) :美国大学在展 示 就 “真实世界的学习中 ”能教给学生 哪些本领方面刚刚起 步 。 可见 , reputation“声誉 ”符合该语义逻辑 :尽管美国大学的优异教学享誉全 球 ,但真实世界教学刚刚起步 。
　　　predominance“优势 ;主导地位 ”在语义上能和 global搭配 ,干扰性较强 ,但该词侧重表示“数量或影 响力的绝对优势 ”,与“excellence in teaching(教学质量优异) ”不能构成合理的因果关系 。
　　【补充语法】despite为介词 ,为“让步转折 ”标记 ,后接名词性成分 ,若要接 that从句 ,需插入 the fact 等名词成分 。如 :she wentto spain despite the factthather doctorhad toldher to rest. (尽管医生告诉   她要休息 ,她还是去了西班牙 。)
34. 答案:C) demanding
　　【确定词性】空格所在分句谓语部分不完整 ,空格位于系动词 are之后 ,宾语 advanced thinking skills 之前 ,据此判断应填入及物动词的 ing分词 ,可选范围 :C)demanding、J)presuming。
　　　【锁定答案】句子前后以 but形成转折 ,先让步指出“基于知识的学位依然重要 ”,再转折指出雇主对 “高级思维能力 ”的态度 。可推断句子整体意在说明比起“学位 ”、雇主更看重“高级思维能力 ”,空格处应 填入带有“看重 ,强调 ,要求 ”含义的词 ,demanding符合语义 ,demand sth from sb意为 “要求某人具备某 物/某种能力 ”。
　　　presuming“推测 ,假定 ”一般用于 “presuming sth十 形容词/名词  十 for sb”结构(如  presume advanced thinking skillsimportant/ an essentialcapacityforcolleges) ,不能用于本句的               sthfrom sb结构。
35. 答案:A) accurately
　　【确定词性】由空格所在位置 can be        measured推测其为动词 measure的修饰成分 ,应填入副 词 ,可选范围 :A)accurately、N)simultaneously。
　　【锁定答案】空格所在句和 上下文均没有明确提示 “测量 ”特征 , 因此只能将可选范围的词代入空 格 ,看是否能构成合理搭配 ,并符合语义逻辑 。accurately“精确地 ”能与 measure搭配 ,也能形成合理的 句内逻辑 :“大学学位的价值能得以准确测量 ”可吸引“更多人选择高等教育 ”。

　　　simultaneously“同步地 ”能与 can be             measure搭配 ,但上下文提及 的 “测量的对象 ”只有 “大 学学位的智力价值 ”,而非多个对象(advancedthinking skills与 intellectualworth实为同一事物) ,故“同 步测量 ”不成立 。

　　　[c] ooilpriceshavedroppedbyover60% sinceJune 2014.  @A commonly held view in the oilindustry is that “the best cure for low oilprices is low oilprices. ”ΘThe 		reasoning  behind  this  saying  is  that  low   oil  prices discourage   investment   in   new    production   capacity,  eventually shifting  the oil supply curve backward and bringingpricesbackup①   asexistingoilfields— which can be 	tapped②   atrelativelylow marginalcost③ — aredepleted④  .④  	In fact, inlinewith⑤   pastexperience, capitalexpenditurein 		the oil sector has dropped sharply in many producing 			countries,  including the united states.

	　　　自 2014年 6 月以来 ,石油价格 已下 跌 60% 以上 。 石油行业普遍 认为 , “油价低的最好解 决 方 法 是 低油价 ”。这种论断背 后 的 理 由 是 低油价会 抑制对新产能 的 投 资 , 而 随着现有 油 田 (以相对较低的边 际 成本 被 开 采) 枯竭 , 最 终将导致石 油供应曲 线 下 行 、油价回升 。 事实 上 ,与 以 往经验相符的是 , 包括美 国在 内的许多石油生产国 家 的 石 油行业资本支出已大幅下降 。 不 过 ,本轮对 于 低 油 价 的 动态调整可 能会有所不同 。


　　　[D]  0oil prices are expected to remain lower for longer.   @ The advent⑥      of new technologies has added about4. 2millionbarrels⑦   perdayto the crudeoilmarket,
　contributing to a global over-supply. 36     Θ In addition,  otherfactorsareputtingdownward pressureon oilprices:  change in the strategic behavior of the organization of petroleum⑧    Exporting countries,  the projected⑨    increase in Iranian exports,  the scaling-down⑩     of global demand (especially from emerging markets) , the long-term drop in petroleum consumption in the unitedstates, and some displacement of  oil  by  substitutes.    ④  These  likely persistent forces,  like the growth of shale( 页 岩 )  oil,  pointto a “low for long”scenarioO11 .

　　　[E]  0Natural gas and coal—also fossilfuels—have similarly seen price declines thatlook to belong-lived.  @
coal and  natural gas are mainly used for electricity
generation,   whereas  oil  is   used  mostly  to  power
transportation, yet the prices of all these energy sources are linked.   Θ The North American shale gas boom has resulted in  record  low   prices  there.    ④  The  recent
discovery ofthe giantzohrgasfieldofftheEgyptian coast
will   eventually   have   impact   on   pricing   in   the
Mediterranean region andEurope, and there is significant
development potential in  many other places,  notably
Argentina. 39 Θcoal prices also are low, owing to over- supply and the scaling-down of demand,  especially from  china, which burns halfofthe world,s coal.

　　　[L] OThenationsparticipating atCOp21arefocusing on quantitative④    emissions-reduction commitments. 37   @  Economic reasoning shows thatthe least expensive way for each country is to put a price on carbon emissions. ΘThe reason is that when carbon is priced, those emissions reductions that are least costly to implement⑤  will happen first. ④ The International Monetary Fund calculates that countriescan generatesubstantialfiscalrevenuesby eliminating fossilfuelsubsidies⑥  and levying⑦  carbon charges thatcapture⑧   the domestic damage caused by emissions.  Θ A tax on upstream⑨  carbon sources is one easy way to put a price on carbon emissions, although some countries may wish to use othermethods, such asemissionstradingschemes⑩ . ΘIn order to maximize global welfare, every country,s carbon pricing should reflect not only the purely domestic damage from emissions, butalso the damageto foreign countries.


　　　[M]  0setting the right carbon price will therefore efficientlyalign the costspaidbycarbon userswithO11  the true socialopportunitycostofusing carbon.  @Byraising relative demand for clean energy sources, a carbon price would also help to align the market return to clean-energy innovation withits social return, spurringO12  the refinementO13  of existing technologies and the development of new ones.   Θ And it would raise the demand for technologies such as carbon capture and storage, spurring theirfurtherdevelopment.④  Ifnot corrected by the appropriate carbon price, low fossil fuelprices are not accurately signaling to markets the true social profitability of clean energy.   Θ while alternative estimates ofthe damage from carbon emissions differ, and it,s especially hard to reckonO14   the likely costs of possible catastrophic  climate   events,    most   estimates   suggest substantialnegative effects.

A) Itis imperative to protectscientists,patents.	A) 保护科学家专利极其重要 。
B) Repositories are essential to scientific research.	B) 数据库于科学研究必不可少 。
C) open data sharing is mostimportantto medical science.	C) 开放数据共享对医学非常重要 。
D) open data sharing is conducive to scientific advancement.	D) 开放数据共享有助科学进步 。
　　　[精准定位]本题考查 “研究者大体接受的观点 ”, 由 many researchers generally accept可定位至首 段 ②句从句 many researchers broadly agree. . . 。 注 : 题干  generally对应文中 broadly,故取 “总体上来 说 ,大致 ”之意 ,而不取“普遍地 ,广泛地 ”之意 。
　　　[锁定答案]D) o  该从句指出诸多研究者大体接受的观点:对原始数据的公开访问(即开放 的 数 据 共享) 能增进科学 ,正确项 D是对 public access to raw data would accelerate science的同义改写 。
　　　[排除干扰]A、C项 scientists,patents、medical science均为文中未提及信息 。 B项虽复现第二段 ① 句 repository,但该句只传递出少数科学团体支持使用数据 库 ,并不能由此推出他们认为数据库是科研 必需 ;且题干所问为“多数研究者支持观点 ”,而本项指向 “少数研究团体行为 ”。提醒:聪明学生从常识 即能排除 B项 :数据库是信息技术发展的产物 ,而科学研究自古有之 ,前者并非后者必需 。
　　　[提炼思路]本道事实细节题虽说考 查 细 节 , 实质可采取 “紧扣话题 、缩窄范围 、排除不匹配信息所  在项 ”的思路来解答 :据由首段 open data sharers、publicaccessto raw data、postthe resultsoftheirown labours online所组建的语义场“数据共享 ”可先锁定 C、D项 ; 而后排除 medical science这一文中缺失信  息所在的 C项 。

47.  whatistheattitude ofmostresearchers towards makingtheirown datapublic?	47.  大多数研究者对公开 自 己 数据的态度是 什么?
A) opposed.	A) 反对的 。
B) Ambiguous.	B) 模棱两可的 。
C) Liberal.	C) 开明的 。
D) Neutral.	D)  中立的 。
　　　[精准 定 位] 本题考查 “多数研究者对数据共享的态度 ”, 由  attitude of most researchers towards making theirown data public可定位至首段 ②句主句 mostare reluctantto postthe results oftheir own labours online和第二段 . . . scientists have objected to sharing. . . 。
　　　[锁定答案]A) 。首段 ②句即指 出 “大多数研究者不愿意将其原始数据共享 ”,第二段虽指出 “少数 科学团体同意共享 ”,但随后否定这是一种常规做法 ,意即大多数群体并不同意共享 。 正确项 A是对首 段 ②句 reluctant、第二段 ②句 objected 的合理概括 。
　　　[排除干扰]B、D项将首段 ②句让步-转折关联 “虽认可但并不愿这么做 ”偷换为并列关联 “一 面认  可 、一面又不认可 ”,从而捏造出“模棱两可的 、中立的 ”两种态度 。C项“开明 ”实指“支持 ”,与文意相悖 。
　　　[提炼思路]命题人于“语义转折处 ”(首段 ②句 Although many researchers broadly agree. . . , most are reluctant. . . ;第二段 ①句  some communities have agreed to share online. . .  , but these. . . not the rule. . .  scientists have objected to sharing. . . ) 设置人物态度题 ,解题需 : 1. 意识到转折后才是人物观点   的集中体现 ,关键词 reluctant、notthe rule、have objected to表明多数研究者反对数据共享 ;2. 借人物观   点与作者观点间关系(用以佐证 、还是用以批驳) 验证选项 , 由 “数据共享者过少(stillin the minority in manyfields) Vs 数 据 共 享 大 有 裨 益 ( not purely altruistic. . .  get plenty of personal benefits. . .  can benefit. . . ) ”可知作者旨在批驳“多数研究者不共享研究数据的行为 ”。

48.  According to the passage,  what might hinder open data sharing?	48.  根据这篇文章 , 什么有可能 阻 碍 开放数据共享?
A) The fearofmassive copying.	A) 对大规模复制的担心 。
B) The lack ofa research culture.	B) 研究文化的欠缺 。


C) Thebeliefthatresearch dataisprivateintellectualproperty.	C) 研究数据是个人知识财产的信念 。
D) The concernthatcertainagenciesmaymakea profitoutofit.	D) 某些机构可能会从中获利的担忧 。
　　　[精准定位]本题考查“数据共享的阻碍因素 ”,可定位至直接阐述 “研究者不愿共享数据 之 因 ”的第 二段 ②句(scientistshaveobjected to sharingformanyreasons. . . ) 和可能间接提及“数据共享障碍 ”的第 三段(the barriers are disappearing, in partbecause. . . ) 。
　　　[锁定答案]c) 。第二段 ②句罗列科学家反对数据共享的五项原 因/数据共享的五重阻碍 : 工作量  大 、数据库质量低 、基金资助者不重视 、科学家们就 “数据如何编码 、数据如何归功 ”难以达成 一 致 ,但无  一契合选项 。第三段先指出数据共享阻碍消失部分源于期刊和资助机构的鼓励敦促 , 随后以实例力  证 :伦敦皇家学会称 ,科学家们需要“改变‘数据被视作私有品9 的研究文化 ”,反向可 推 知 “‘以数据为私  有品的研究文化9阻 碍了数据共 享 ”, 正确项 C 是  a research culture where data is viewed as a private preserve的同义改写 。
　　　[ 排除干扰]A项 copying源自第四段末词 reproducible,但该句意在讲述 “共享数据的好处 :有利于 共享者研究成果被引用 、被复制 ”, 即 ,“被复制 ”是 “开放共享数据的益处 ”而非题干所问 “共享数据的障 碍 ”。B项虽复现第三段 ②句 a research culture,但却将文意 “以数据为私有品的固有研究 文 化 ”篡改为 “研究文化的欠缺 ”。D项根据第三段 ③句碎片信息 Funding agencies、publicmoney捏造而来 ,而该句实 际是对资助机构思想意识转变的赞赏 ,而非像选项所述对其贬低 。
　　　[ 提炼思路]本题考查文章细节 ,却涉及逆向推理 ,难点在于 “答案的准确定位 ”: 由题干 hinder可定 位至第三段段首 the barrier,the barrier显然回指第二段 ②句科学家反对数据共享的诸多原因 ,但发现 选项均无法匹配原文 。此时 ,意识到第三段 “共享阻碍消失的原 因 ”中亦可能提及 “阻碍数据共享的因 素 ”, ②句佐证部分“伦敦皇家学会敦促改变‘以数据为私有品的研究文化9”逆推即可得正确项 C。
49.  whathelpsliftsomeofthebarriersto open data sharing?	
49.  什么有助消除开放数据共享的一些障碍?
A) The ever-growing demand forbig data.	A) 对大数据日益增长的需求 。
B) The advancementofdigital technology.	B) 数字技术的进步 。
C) The changing attitude ofjournals and funders.	C) 期刊和资助方态度的转变 。
D) The trend ofsocial and economic development.	D) 社会和经济发展的趋势 。
　　　[精准定 位] 本题考查 “数据共享的推动因素 ”, 由  lift some of the barriers可定位至第 三 段 (the barriers are disappearing. . . ) 。
　　　[锁定答案]c) 。第三段 ①句指出 “数据共享阻碍正趋消失 ,这部分源于全球期 刊 和 资 助 机 构 的 鼓  励 ”,上溯至第二段 ②句明确“数据共享过去阻碍之一即基金资助方未敦促共享 ”,两相对比 ,可知 “期刊  和资助方态度的转变 ”是数据共享推动因素之一 ,正确项 C是 grantfunderswerenotpushingfor. . .  Vs funding agencies. . . are encouraging. . . 昔今变化的正确阐述 。
　　　[ 排除干扰]A项虽复现第三段 ④句 the growing demand,但将其指代内容 “对数据共享日益增长的 需求 ”篡改为“对大数据日益增长的需求 ”。B项源自第三段 ③句第二分句的宾语“共享方式实现数字化 变革(. . . digitallyin waysthatwerenotpossiblebefore) ”,但这是客观局势 ,这一局势本身与数据共享障 碍消除之间并无因果关联 ,真正与数据共享障碍消除有因果关联的 是 整 个 句 子 “科学家对这 一 客观形 势的积极认知 ”。D项“社会经济发展趋势 ”文中并未提及 。
　　　[ 提炼思路]本题考查因果 , 关键在把握因果关联 词 , 而第三段首句即由  in part because 引出了  journals and funding agencies这两个主体 , 由此可以很快将正确答案锁定在 C 项 。 本题最大干扰在 A 项 , 区辨关键在对段末句 the growing demand 的正确理解 ,而由上下文可知该词应该指代 “对数据共享  行为日益增长的需求 ”而非“对大数据日益增长的需求 ”,如果实在不愿费时费力进行区 辨 ,亦可从全文

论述主题是“数据共 享 ”而非 “大数据 ”上加以排除 。 干扰项 B、D 实质性质类似 ,且 D 涵盖 B(甚至 A、 C) ,若选择只能选择 D,但考题多半 由文章大意而出 ,正确项不可能大 而 泛 之 ,将其无节制扩放到毫无   精准性的“社会经济发展趋势 ”。

第一 、二段就事件“梅西百货实体店在假日购物旺季中销售额惨淡 ”分析原因 。 第一段引出事件并分析原因 。
　　　①句详述事件:梅西百货实体店在 11、12月的节日购物旺季中 销 售 额 骤 降 。 主句以反向对比强调  事件本身的糟糕 :plunged“骤降 ”一举打破 NovemberandDecember与 storesopen morethan ayear暗藏  文意 “门 店 节 假  日 生 意 本 应 更 好 ”; 同 位 语  以 多 重 负 面 词  (disappointing、difficult、wide-ranging challenges) 凸显事件的糟糕程度 :年底惨淡 的销售业绩使得本就举步维艰 、困难重重的 一 年雪上加霜 ,  两者借 capped“使结束 ”相连 ,更是形象传递出公司被压得喘不过气来 、毫无回旋余地的艰难处境 。
　　　②③句分析原因 。Meanwhile明确两句间并列 关 联 。 两句借 Its这 一 第三人称手法表明此乃作者 分析评价(与下段所述公司的官方说辞相区别) 。
　　　②句分析原因一:美元强劲使外国游客旅游消费减少 。dependheavilyon、astrongdollar、shrank三 者之间构成紧密的“前提— 事件— 后果 ”逻辑链 :严重依赖国际旅游消费 ,而 一 旦美元强劲 , 国际旅游消 费将缩水 。 注 :美元强劲意味着美元升值 ,外国游客要兑换等量美元需付出更多本国货币 。
　　　③句分析原因二:消费者的消费意向难以为梅西百货创收 。本句形似借 has simply struggled强调  梅西百货在竭力留住消费者 (simply“简直 , 实在 ”起到强调作用) , 实则借  consumers who are more interested in spending on. . . than on. . . 凸显消费者的消费兴趣根本不在“百货 ”这一方面 ,深层暗示梅西  百货的消费者群体定位不当 ,该另辟蹊径以求提升其冷清的门店销售额 。

51.  whatdoes the author say aboutthe shrinking spending ofinternationaltouristsin theU. S. ?	51.  对国际游客在美消费的缩减 ,作者有 什么说法?
A) Itisattributable to the rising valueoftheU. S.  dollar.	A) 这是由美元升值导致的 。
B) Itis a directresultofthe global economic recession.	B) 这是全球经济衰退的直接后果 。
C) Itreflects a shiftoftheirinterestin consumergoods.	C) 这反映了他们对消费品兴趣的转变 。
D) Itposesapotentialthreatto the retailbusinessintheU. S.	D) 这对美国零售行业是潜在威胁 。
　　　[精准定位] 本题询问作者对在美外国游客开销变少的意见 , 由 shrinking spending of international tourists可定位至第一段 ②句(international touristspending) 。
　　　[锁定答案] A) 。第一段 ②句指出 ,梅西百货在美国大城市的旗舰店极度依赖外国游客的消费 , 而 美元强势使得外国游客的 旅 游 消 费 减 少 , 从而使得各门店销量萎缩 。 由此可知 , 美元强势(即美元升

值)是国际游客在美消费缩减的原因 ,正确项 A是对 a strong dollar的同义改写 。
　　　[排除干 扰] B 项中 “全球经济衰退 ”文中并未提及 。 C 项利用 ③ 句  consumers who are more interested in spending on. . . than on. . . “消费者消费兴趣 ”设障 ,但句中只涉及消费者具体兴趣 ,而选项  首先将对象缩窄为国际游客(theirinterest指代题干的 international tourists,interest) ,其次将内容偷换  为兴趣改变 。D项将 ②句所述国际游客在美消费缩减的影响“梅西百货旗舰店销量减少(因其主要依赖  国际游客消费) ”夸大为“整个零售业均受到潜在威胁 ”。
　　　[提炼思路] 本题形似考查作者态度(whatdoes the author say) ,实质考查 “在美游客开销 变 少 ”的  前因后果(A项 attributable提示原因 、B项 result提示结果 、C项 reflects a shift提示因果 ,D 项 poses a threat提示影响)。而文中提及“国际游客 ”的唯有首段 ②句 ,且该句呈现 shrank. . . due to因果关联 , 由  此将正确答案锁定在 which从句中 。注 :若有一定货币知 识 ,可知货币强势意味着货币升值 ;若不了解  相关知识仍可根据词汇字面意思(strong往往代表 “正面的 ”或 “向上的 ”,应该对应货币升值) 或历史事  件(2008年金融危机 ,全球经济衰退 ,美元大幅贬值 ,与 B项刚好相反)确定答案 。

第二段给出官方说辞。
　　　①②句给出官方解释:主要由于气候异常(暖冬) ,使得防寒用品需求量减少、销售额降低 。两句借 引号及同义表达(blamed much of. . . on. . . ≈About80% of. . . can be attributed to. . . )形成引证关联 , 其中 unseasonably一方面借其本义“违反时令地 ”以“暖冬现象是异常的 ”来说明“这一影响是偶然的 、短 暂的 ”,另一方面借其隐含义“不合时宜地 ”说明这 一 影响是负面的 、不受欢迎的 。 注 :year-over-year“同 比 ”又作 year-on-year,指与上年同期的比较 。
　　　③句补充这一因素给公司带来 的 影 响:下 调 整 个 季度业绩预测 。This实际回指前 一 句 CEO 所述 “因暖冬而造成的销售缺口 ”;prompted明确因果关联 :暖冬使得销量下降 → 降低整个第四季度预期(整 个季度都将会受到暖冬影响) ;full强调这一因素对整个第四季度的销售业绩影响 。

第三至五段阐述梅西百货针对实体店销售额惨淡景象采取的“开源节流 ”措施 。 第三 、四段介绍“节流 ”措施 。
第三段介绍“节流 ”措施一 :缩减开支 、大幅裁员 。
　　　①句转承 上 段 “官方 说 辞 ”指出内部看法 : 意识到并非天气原因这么简单 。 deeper、temporary aberration两词深层表明梅西百货已然 认 识 到 自 己 的 问 题 并 非 偶 然 的 、暂时的 , 而是长期 、必然 的 。 it,s clear实际传递作者判断 :梅西百货“肯定 ”认为自己麻烦很大 ,为下文作者列举梅西百货种种措施(以证  实自身判断) 埋下伏笔 。
　　　②句进而指出其解决办法:开始执行 4 亿美元开支缩减计划 。pushed这一隐性因果词表达出梅西 百货开支缩减的终极原因是全年业 绩 问 题 、而 非 官 方 所 示 的 年底暖冬现象所造成的销售锐减问题 ,从 而凸显问题的严重性 ,复现上句 deeper之意 。
　　　③至 ⑤句详细说明这一计划的具体 措 施( 之 一):裁员 。本句群 一 方面借具体数字(600back-office positions, 165 senior executives,  770stores,  3000 employees) 凸 显 裁 员 规 模 之 大 , 另 一 方 面 又 借  reassigned、voluntary separation、slash 体现出裁员过程中有所偏倚 ,不少后勤人员只是调职 , 资深主管  亦可选择“自愿 ”离职 ,而对门店的裁员措施则最为直接 ,反映出公司当前对门店的战略定位偏低 。

　　　[排除干扰] A项根据 ③④句 “约 150个后勤职位被调整 、约 165位高管可选择 自 愿 离 职 ”臆断出 “更好的管理 ”,而该句实际意在说明梅西百货采取了 “裁员措施 ”而非 “更好的管理措施 ”。C项利用末 段“线上销售增长快 ”设障 ,但文中并未提及 “线上(存在) 问题 ”,而只谈及 “门店(即线下) (存在) 问题 ”, 可比性无中生有 。D项反向干扰 , 由 ②句 “4亿元开支缩减计划 ”反向捏造而来( ,对于实体店销售不 佳 问题 ,梅西百货采取的是缩减开支措施 、而非加大投资力度)。
　　　[提炼思路] 本题形似考查梅西百货对其自 身 问 题 的 看 法 ,实则考查对段落群中语义逻辑的掌握 。 文章第二段首句谈及梅西百货将销售不佳主要归咎于不合时宜的暖冬 ,而第三段首句借 However转而   指出该公司很清楚地知道其问题的 原 因 不 仅 仅 是 气 温 这 么 简 单 。本题考查的就是这 一 转折的段落群   语义逻辑 ,因 However而将语义重点落于第三段首句,而重点即考点,答案为 B项 。

C) adjustits promotion strategies	C) 调整推广策略
D) reduce the size ofits staff	D) 减小员工规模
　　　[精准定位] 本题考查梅西 百货削减开支的具体做法 , 由 cut cost定位至第三段 ②句(cost-cutting measures)。
　　　[锁定答案] D)。第三段 ②句概述指出梅西已开始实施开支缩减计划 , ③至 ⑤句详述具体措施 :削  减后勤岗 位 、劝退高级管理人员 、裁减门店员工 。 正确项  D 是对  cut. . . back-office positions、offer “voluntary separation”packages to. . . senior executives、slash staffing atits stores的合理概括 。
　　　[排除干扰] A项将段中 ④句 “让高级管理人员自愿离职 ”偷换为 “削减高级管理人员薪水 ”。B项 将第四段“关闭门店(close) ”偷换为“让门店迁址(relocate) ”。C项中“推广策略 ”文中并未提及 。
　　　[提炼思路] 本文考查梅西百货的做法 ,由于选项涉及多项具体措施 ,所以可从选项出发 。具体解   题步骤有 :一 、提取选项关键词(senior executives、chain stores、promotion strategies、the size of staff) ; 二 、按关键词定位原文(A对应第三段 ④句 ,B对应第四段 ①句 ,C无直接对应 ,D对应第三段 ⑤句) ;三 、 结合选项与原文确定答案 。注 :D项“减小员工规模 ”虽然可按照选项关键词定位原文“裁减门店员工 ”, 但事实上也概括了前两个措施(削减后勤岗位 、劝退资深主管)。

　　　[ 排除干扰] B项利用第五段 ②句 bettercompetewith ambitiousT.  J.  Maxx设障 ,而句中只谈及这 只是一 种可能 “might”, 文中后续并未谈及事实性结果 。 C 项倒置第五段 ④ 句 “( 梅西百货 希 望) Bluemercury巩固自身在美妆销售中的 地 位 ”, 且文中后续并未提及 Bluemercury的扩张进度 。 D 项利 用第六段 ①句 itfilled设障 ,但 此处指订单的 “完成 ”而非商品的 “填充 ”, 且订单完成量的增长指线上 (online channel) ,与实体店(stores) 无直接联系 。
　　　[提炼思路] 解答本题甚至可以跨越文章细节 ,而只从文章主旨上去考虑 。 诸如 B、C项所述 T.  J.  Maxx、Bluemercury与题干所述假日季根本不存在任何关系 ,而 D项“货品供应 ”实际上与文中多次重复 的“销售业绩不佳 ”无甚关联 ,可从“不贴合主旨 ”角度排除 ,故选择 A项 。

明朝

　　　The Ming Dynasty, which ruled China for276 years, is described as one of the greatest eras of orderly governance and social stability in human history.   During this period,   the development of handicraftindustry promoted the market economy and urbanization.  A large number of commodities,  including alcohol and silk, were soldin the market.  Meanwhile, many foreign goods such as clocks and tobacco were also imported.  A series of commercialmetropolises including Beijing, Nanjing, yangzhou andsuzhou were successivelyformed.  Itwas also in the Ming Dynasty thatthe fleets led by zheng He made seven large-scale expeditionary voyages to the Indian ocean.  Itis also worth mentioning thatthree of the fourgreatclassicalmasterpieces ofChinese literature were written during this time.

1.  明朝统治中国 276年 ,被人们描绘成人类历史上治理有序 、社会稳定的最伟大的时代之 一 。
　　　[ 词 汇 准 备] 明 朝  the Ming Dynasty; 统 治  reign;  rule; 描 绘  depict;  describe; 治 理  governance; government;有序 orderly;时代 era; time; epoch
　　　[ 句子解析]本句总括明朝的伟大历史成就 。句子含有两个谓语信息 :“统治中国 276年 ”以及“被人 们描绘成…… ”;前者属事实信息 、通常属于次要信息 ,可译为表示解释说明作用 的 非 限 制 性 定 语 从 句 , 并据其时态和语态分别选择一般过去时和主动语态 ;后者属于评论信息 、通常属于重要信息 ,故将其译 为主句 ,并据其时态和语态分别选择一般现在时和被动语态 。 主句中 “人类历史上…… 的时代之 一 ”实 际上是以“时代 ”为中心词的偏正 结 构 ,其修饰语可拆解为 “人 类历史上最伟大的之 一 ”、“治理有序 、社 会稳定的 ”,前者可直译为 one of the greatesteras in human history,后者可译为带有所属性质的(eras) oforderlygovernance and social stability。
2.  这一时期 ,手工业的发展促进了市场经济和城市化 。
　　　[ 词汇准 备] 手工业 handicraft industry; 促进 promote;  boost; facilitate; contribute to; 市场经济 marketeconomy;城市化 urbanization
　　　[ 句子解析]本句总述明朝手工业发展对市场经济及城市化的作用 。“这一时 期 ”是时间状语 ,可有   多种选择 ,duringthisperiod/time/age。“手工业的发展促进了市场经济和城市化 ”,主要考查词汇表达 。 如果在考场上一时想不出对应的表达 ,还可以尝试采用解释的方法翻译 , 比如 “城市化 ”就是 “城市的形   成 ”、“乡村变成城市 ”,译为 formation ofcities、transformation ofvillages into cities也可接受 。

3.  大量商品 ,包括酒和丝绸 ,都在市场销售 。
　　　[ 词汇 准 备] 大量 a great/large number/amount of; 商品 goods; commodity; 酒 alcohol; alcoholic drink;丝绸 silk;销售 sell
　　　[ 句子解析]本句介绍明朝市场经济的繁荣景象 。 先提取主干 “大量商品(在市 场) 销售 ”,显然这里  指商品“被卖 ”,所以直接译为被动态 be sold;由于这里指商品处于“待售 ”状态 , 因此亦可译为 be for/on sale,还可转换叙述角度“商品待售 = 商品可买 ”从而译为 be available。“在市场 ”是地点状语,译为介词  结构 in/on themarket。“包括酒和丝绸 ”是插入语 ,可译为 including结构 ;一说到“酒 ”,也许最容易想到  wine,但 wine特指葡萄酒 ,而这里应泛指各种酒类 ,更准确的译法是 alcohol。
4.  同时 ,还进口许多外国商品 ,如时钟和烟草 。
　　　[ 词汇准备] 同时 meanwhile/in themeantime; atthesametime;simultaneously;进口 import;外国商 品 foreign commodity/product/goods;烟草 tobacco
　　　[ 句子解析]本句继续介绍明朝市场经济的繁荣景象 。本句主干 “进口许多外 国 商 品 ”无主语 ,适合 译为被动句 。“如时钟和烟草 ”直接借用 such as或 for instance结构 ,其中 clock 用复数形式表示泛指 , 而 tobacco是不可数名词 ,不加 s。
5.  北京 、南京 、扬州 、苏州这样的大商业中心相继形成 。
　　　[ 词汇准备] 商业中心 commercialcenter; businesscenter;相继 successively; in succession; oneafter another;形成 form; come into being; take shape
　　　[ 句子解析]本句介绍明朝的城市化 。先处理句子主干 “大商业中心形成 ”,这是 “主 十谓 ”结构 ,“大  商业中心 ”可译为  commercial metropolises(商业大都市) , 也 可以按照字面直译为  large commercial/ business centers, “形 成 ”最 直 接 的 是 译 为  were formed。“相 继 ”是 修 饰 “形 成 ”的 状 语 , 译 为 副 词  	successively,也可以译为短语 in succession、one after another置于句末 。“北京 、南京 、扬州 、苏州 ”是对  “大商业中心 ”的举例 ,“这样的 ”说明这种举例是非穷尽式的(穷尽式应该说“这几个 ”) ; 由于中文习惯先  分述后总提 ,而英文恰好相反 , 习惯先总提后分述 ,所以英文译文中应该把所举城市放在后面 ,译为 A 	series of. . . including. . . 、或 . . . such as. . . 。
6.  也是在明代 , 由郑和率领的船队曾到印度洋进行了七次大规模探险航行 。
　　　[ 词汇 准 备 ]  率 领  lead; 船 队  fleet; 印 度 洋  the Indian ocean; 大 规 模  large-scale; 探 险 ( 的 ) expeditionary; exploration;航行 voyage; sail
　　　[ 句子解析] 本句介绍明朝辉煌的航海成就 。“是 在明代 ”蕴含强调意味 , 可译为强调句 it was. . .   that. . . 。剥离出句子主干是“船队曾进行了航行 ”,译为 fleets made voyages。 修饰成分中 , “由郑和率  领的 ”修饰“船队 ”, 是带有主谓结构(“郑和 ”十 “率领 ”) 的复杂修饰语 , 可译为过去分词 led by zheng He,做后置定语 ;“七次大规模探险 ”修饰“航行 ”,虽然较长但结构不复杂 , 根据英语习惯 ,按 “数量词 →  评述词 → 目的词 ”顺序排列 ,译为前置定语 seven large-scale expeditionary;“到印度洋 ”是 “航行 ”地点状  语 ,可译为 to介词短语放在其后 。
7.  还值得一提的是 , 中国文学的四大经典名著中有三部写于明朝 。
　　　[ 词汇 准 备 ]值 得 一 提  worth mentioning;  noteworthy; 中 国 文 学  chinese literature; 经 典 名 著 classicmasterpieces
　　　[ 句子解析]本句介绍明朝的文学成就 。“还 ”使本句与上句形成并列关系 ,通常译为 also; “值得 一  提的 是 ”引 出 强 调 内 容 , 英 语 中 类 似 的 表 达 包 括  It is worth mentioning that. . . 、what is worth mentioning isthat. . . 、Itisnoteworthythat. . . ,平时可多积累 。逗号后内容的主干是“三部(被) 写 ”, 由  于英文没有量词概念 ,“部 ”无需译出 ,所以译为被动句 three. . . were written。“中国文学的四大经典名  著中 ”是修 饰 “三部 ”的定语 , 可以按照字面直接译为  the four great classical masterpieces ofchinese literature;但根据常识可知“四大经典名著 ”即小说 , 因此亦可灵活处理成 theFourGreatclassicNovels,  并大写首字母 ,体现这种说法约定俗成 。 “于明朝 ”是时间状语 , 考 虑 到 上文已经出现两次 the Ming Dynasty,因此这里可以用 this time,让译文更加自然 。

重难点词汇短语	高分翻译	低分翻译
治理有序 、社会稳定	orderlygovernance and social stability	　( which  is)   organized  and  stable;   an organized and stable society
进口…… 外国商品	foreign goods/commodities were imported	goods/things were boughtfrom other countries
相继形成	　came into being/were formed successively/ in succession	were continuously/continually formed
进行了 …… 航行	made/conducted voyages	carried outboattravels
值得一提	worth bringing up/mentioning; noteworthy	worth putting forward
　
　　　名词前有多个形容词做定语时的 排 列 规 律 。 英语中 , 当有两个或两个以上前置定语时 , 形容词排   列顺序通常有一定的规则 : 限定词(the, this, his) → 数词(three) → 评述词(good) → 大小形状(big, long)  → 新旧年龄(new, young) → 颜色(red) → 产地(chinese) → 材料(wooden) → 用途目的(medical) 十名词 。 其内在规律在于 :形容词所代表的性质越客观 、越本质 , 就离名词越近 。 限定词(如物主代词 、指示代   词 、冠词) 和数词与名词关系最不密切 ,无关名词本身属性 ,所以距离最远 。 以此类推 ,用途目的和人类   生活最为密切 ,是事物深刻的属性 ,所以离名词最近 。 如第 6 句中 ,就出现多个形容词做定语修饰名词   的情况 ,“七次 ”、“大规模 ”、“探险(的) ”共同修饰“航行 ”,译文  seven large-scale expeditionary voyages恰   好和中文顺序一致 ,但实际上是经过安排的 :seven(数词) → large-scale(评述词) → expeditionary( 目的)  十voyages(名词) 。

Typically, traditional universities offer programs that are intended to provide students with a
solid foundation of skills and knowledge related to a broad area of study. In addition, they include
learning requirements for general education and liberal arts courses. Often, these programs are
designed to take approximately four years of full-time study, and they equip students with the
prerequisites to enter a variety of fields or pursue a graduate education.
一般来说,传统大学课程为学生提供坚实的技能和知识基础,这些技能和知识与广泛的研究
领域相关。另外,它还要求学生学习通识和人文课程。通常,这些课程项目需要大约四年的全日

 The biggest drawback in choosing a vocational college is that the creda are not as
prestigious as those of traditional colleges. Moreover, they may not be considered as Qerequisites if
a person desires to attend a regular college later.选择职业院校最大的缺点是它的学八不如传统大
学的学分权威。此外,如果想从职业院校毕业后去普通本科院校读书,它的学分可能不被认可。

　11-12.  男士对于创作 完成的看法

　
1.  男士发现自己的书出现在二手书书店时会作何感想?
A) 他会感觉到耻辱 。	C) 他会感到尴尬 。
B) 他会非常伤心 。	D) 他会很失望 。


[设题要点] 人物观点处(Ithink)。
[答案精析] A)。feelinsulted是对 Thatkind ofthingisdifficult、thisisan insult、Ifeelit,san insult
too等信息的综合判断 。B)、C)、D) 都是从 difficult一 词做出的主观臆测 ,但由下文可知 ,difficult此处 指“很难说希望在二手书店看到自己的书还是不希望 ,因为觉得都有损颜面 ”。
2. 男士的妻子如何看待他的书?
A) 它们值得获奖 。	C) 它们读起来不错 。
B) 它们没有价值 。	D) 它们需要改进 。
　　　[设题要点] 观点处(This isn,t really whatmy wife is trying to criticizeme about. It,s always about execution. )。
　　　[答案精析] D)。A)、C)均表“赞赏 ”,与 veryharsh(特别苛刻)、She thoughtitwas rubbish. . . 所体 现的“总爱批评 ”的形象 不 符 。B) 干扰很大 ,She thought为观点标记词 ,rubbish与 of little value也契 合 ,但这是妻子对他 04年新书的看法(itwas. . . ) ,用以说明 “脸皮厚(无视 外 界 否 定 ,坚持自己) 的必要 性 ”,而题干实际询问“妻子对作品的总体态度(books) ”,因此题眼在 always about execution(“总批评写 作手法 ”)。D)是“总批评写作手法(而非主题思想) ”暗含的信息 :操作(手法)还需要改进 。

3. 男士写书时会怎么做?
A) 他很少一口气写完一本书 。	C) 他利用自己的真实经历 。
B) 他同时写几本书 。	D) 他经常向妻子寻求帮助 。
[设题要点] 细节处(I,ve often)。
[答案精析] A)。A)是对 often stopped writing a book and leftitfora few years(经常停写某书 ,把
　它放上几年) 的合理推断 。B)、C)男士并未提及“同时写书 ”和“利用真实经历(写书) ”。D) 由 “男士提到 其妻子对他手稿的评价 ”过度推断“他写书常求助于妻子 ”。
4. 男士提及足球比赛是想说明什么?
A) 写作就像观看足球比赛 。	C) 他喜欢在完成一本书后看足球比赛 。
B) 作家其实和足球队员一样竭尽全力 。	D) 和足球比赛不同 ,写书没有终点 。
[设题要点] 细节处(There,s never. . . )。
　　　[答案精析] D)。A)、B)在“写作 VS看足球赛 ”、“作家 VS足球队员 ”之间强加类比关系 。C)在问  题中的“结束写作 ”(finish a book)和作家提到的“看球赛 ”(watch footballers atthe end ofthe match)之  间强加时间先后关系 。D) 同义改写对话信息 :at that moment they know it,s over与 Inever have the momentwhen Ifeel. . . finished、never a finishing whistle显然为类比内容 ,凸显球赛与写作的不同 。

1— W :  According to a study of Race &  Equity in Education, 5cblack athletes are dropping out of college across the country at alarming rates.   With us to talk about the findings in the study iswashington post columnist kevin Blackstone.   Good morning!
2— M : Good morning.  How are you?
3— W : Fine, thankyou.  Whatisnew thatyou found in this study?


4— M : well, this is Shaun Harper,s study.  And he points out that on major college campuses across the country, 5Dblackmalesmakeuplessthan3percentof undergraduate enrollments.  yet,  when you look at their numbers  or  percentages  on  the  revenue- generating sports teams of football and basketball,  theymakeupwellinto50-60percentofthoseteams.   Sotheideaisthattheyare6Dreallytheretobepartof the revenue-generating working class of athletes on campus and not necessarily there to be part of the educatingclassasmoststudentsinothergroupsare.
5— w :  Compared  with  other  groups,   I think  the numbers in this group at those65 schools are something like 7B  just barely more than half of the black maleathletesgraduate atall.
6— M : Exactly.   And what,s really bad about this is these athletes are supposedly promised at least one thing as reward for all their blood and sweat.  And thatis a college degree, which can be a transformative toolin oursociety when you talk about upward mobility.   And that,s really the troubling partaboutthis.
7— w :  well,  this has been talked about so much, really, in recentyears.  whyhasn,t changed?

　　　Ⅱ  However,  today is a new  era in which taking antibiotics can cause some very dangerous and potentially life-threatening situations.   In fact,  you may have heard about the new  “superbugs”,   which  are  13D antibiotic- resistant bacteria that have developed as a result of overprescribed antibiotics.    In  the past,  health  experts warned us that the day would come in which it would become very difficult to provide medical care for even common problems, such as lung infection or severe sore throat.    And,  apparently,  that day has come because seemingly routine operations such as knee replacements are now much 14Dmorehazardousdueto theloomingthreat oftheseinfections.


　　　　Ⅲ  The problem  has grown  into such epidemic proportions thatthis severe strain of resistantbacteria is being blamed  for nearly  700, 000  deaths  each  year throughout  the  world,    and,    unfortunately,   health experts worry that the number will rise to10million or more on a yearly basis by2050.

I  taught  a  seminar  on globalization and I assigned a reading that I had written aboutglobal capital flows.  And as I did each week,  I asked one ofthe students to introduce the readings.  And 		this young man,  in october of his freshman year,  said 				something like the following.  “The reading by president 		summers on the flow of capital across countries, it was kind of interesting,  but the data did not come close to 	supporting the conclusions. ” And Ithought to myself,  “what a fantastic thing this was! How could somebody who hadbeen thereforfiveweeks telltheperson whohad 		the title 6president, thathedidn,treallyknow whathewas 		talking about?”And itwas a specialmoment.

　underestimateourmentalpowers.  Ifyou think thisdoes notapply to you, then here is a simple test to show  you are wrong.   write down the names of all the American states you can remember.  putthe list away and then set yourself the same task a week later.   provided you have not cheated by consulting an atlas,  you willnoticesomething rathersurprising.  20B Thetwo listswillcontain roughlythesamenumberofstates, but they will not be identical.   Some names will have slipped away,  but others will have replaced them.   This suggests that somewhere in your mind you may wellhavea record ofvirtually every state.  So it is not reallyyour memory letting you down; justyour ability to retrieveinformation from it.

You can do this by learning a set number of lines of poetry at different times ofthe day and seeing when most lines stick.  when you have done this, try to organize your life so that the time set aside for learning coincides with the time when yourmemoryis atits best.

	I Hello, today I,m going to talk aboutpoverty.
　　　Ⅱ  poverty has become a critical issue in today,s world.   It concerns not only 23cus sociologists,  but also economists, politicians and businesspeople.  poverty has been understood in manydifferentways.  oneusefulway is to distinguishbetween threedegreesofpoverty: extreme poverty, moderatepoverty, and relativepoverty.
　　　Ⅲ The firsttype of povertyis extremepoverty; it,s also  called  absolute  poverty.    In   extreme  poverty,  households cannot meetbasic needs for survival.  people are chronically hungry.   They are unable to access safe drinkingwater, letalonehealth care.  They cannotafford education fortheirchildren.  In short, people who live in extreme poverty do nothave even the minimum resources to support themselves and their families.   where does extreme poverty occur? well, you can find it only 24D in developing countries.
　　　Ⅳ  well,   what about moderate poverty?  Unlike extreme poverty,  moderate poverty generally refers to conditionsoflifein which basicneedsaremetbutbarely.   people living in moderate poverty have the resources to keep themselvesalive, butonly ata very basic level.  For example, they may have access to drinking water, but notclean, safedrinkingwater.  Theymayhaveahometo shelterthemselves, but itdoes nothave power supply, a telephone orplumbing.
　　　V  The third kind of poverty is relative poverty.   Relative povertyisgenerally consideredto be ahousehold incomelevel, which isbelow agiven proportion ofaverage family income.  The relatively poor live in high-income countries, buttheydo nothaveahigh incomethemselves.   The method of calculating the poverty line is different from country to country, butwe can saythatbasically a family  living  in  relative  poverty  has  less  than  a percentage of the average family income.  For example,  25Bin the united states, a family can be considered poor iftheir income islessthan 50% ofthenationalaverage


　familyincome.  They can meettheirbasicneeds, butthey lack accessto culturalguts, entertainmentand recreation.   They also do not have access to quality health care,  or otherprerequisites for upward socialmobility.
　　　Ⅵ well, Ihavebriefly explained to youhow poverty can bedistinguished asextremepoverty, moderatepoverty and relativepoverty.  we shouldkeep thesedistinctionsin mind when weresearch people,s living conditions, either in the developing or the developed world.
Q23. whatdoes the speaker do?
Q24.  where does  the  speaker  say  we  can  find  extreme poverty?
Q25.  what do  we learn  about American people living in relative poverty?

　　【确定词性】根据空格所在位置 This phenomenon is often   26  to as. . . ,可知它是过去分词 ,与 is 构成被动语态 ,初步确 定 选 择 范 围 :A) classified、E)identified、K) referred。但  classified, identified为及  物动词 ,其后不必接 to(即 ,应为 is classified/identified as. . . ) ,故可填入此 空 的 只 有 不及物动词的过去  分词 K)referred。
　　【锁定答案】空格句指出 ,这种现象(当在新的 地 方 睡 觉 时 ,你的 一 半大脑会保持警觉 ,准备应对危 险)      为“首夜效应 ”,可见该句是在 对现象下定义 ,空格处应为 “被称作 、被视为 ”之意 ,referred符合 文意 , refer to sthas sth(文中为被动语态)为固定搭配 ,意为“把……称作 … …”。
　　【补充 语 法】“界定事物 ”的常用表述 : . . . is referred to as. . . /is named(called). . . /is classified/ identified as. . . /is known as. . . 。
27. 答案:O) volunteers
　　【确定词性】首先根据空格所在位置 the rightearsof   27  可知其为名词 。其次由后文 them、their leftears可 进 一 步 推 断 空 格 词 为 复 数 名 词 。 可 选 范 围 : J) predators、L) species、N) varieties、O)  volunteers。
　　【锁定答案】空格句指出“向          右耳播放声音比向他们的左耳播放声音更有可能把他们叫醒 ”,因 此初步推断 空格词为 “动物或人 ”;再联系段落首 句 (当你 … … ) 可知该实验是以 “人 ”为实验对象 , volunteers为正确项 ,指“自愿做研究对象的人 ”。
　　　其他几个选项中 ,只有  predators有表示“人 ”的释义“掠夺他人的人 ,损人利己的人 ”,但不符合文中 语境(文中并未提及掠夺关系或损人利己等)。
　　【补充语法】1. 动名词兼有动词和名词的特征和作用 ,其动词特征表现在可带有宾语、状语等 ,其名     词特征表现在可担当主语、宾语等 。2. 若语义需要 ,比较标记词 than 后可接 “if引导的条件状语 从 句 ”

　或“when 引导的时间状语从句 ”。本段 ④句包含上述两个语法点:playing. . . of volunteers为长动名词 短语作主语 ;than后接 if引导的条件状语从句 。

…………………
28. 答案:M) specifically
　　【确定词性】句子主干成分完整 :It(主语) 十was observed(被动谓语) 十that(宾语从句) ,所以空格处 只能填入副词 ,修饰被动谓语 ,可选范围 :B)consciously、C)dramatically、M)specifically。
　　【锁定答案】空格句上文(上段)指出“实验观察到 ,睡眠过程中 ,大脑左半球的网 络比大脑右半球的 网络更活跃 ”。空格句指出“研究者          观察到 ,深度睡眠中 ,大脑左半球更加活跃 ”。可见二者逻辑关 系为 :由“睡眠过程中的情形 ”进一步具体 、特定到 “深度睡眠中的情形 ”,specifically“具体地 ,特定地 ,特 别地 ”符合语义 。
　　　B)consciously强调“有意识地 , 自觉地 ”,但空格句为客观观察到的实验结果 ,并非有意 、刻意为之 。 C)dramatically“戏剧性地 、显著地 ”与 observed无法搭配 。
　　【点拨技巧】consciously此处语义搭配较为微妙 ,且涉及 一 定背景知识 ,若考生没有把握完全排除 , 可以暂时标记 ,若下文有更适合处 ,则此处自然排除 。

29.  答案:H) novel
　　【确定词性】根据空格所在位置 a    29    environment可推断其为“以辅音音素开始的形容词 、ed分 词 、ing分词或单数名词 ”,可选范围 :A) classified、G)marine、H) novel、I) potential。
　　【锁定答案】首先空格句指出研究者(对于上文所述研究发现的) 解释 :“我们处于 一 个          环境时 , 大脑部分保持警觉 , 以保护自己 … … ”。空格词需要描述 “环境 ”的主要特 征 ,需要从前文寻找 。 前文指 出实验发现 :第一晚很容易刺激大脑左半球 ,而第二 、三晚以同样的方法则不再 能 刺 激 到 , 即 :这种警觉 仅适用于“新到一个环境 ”,novel“新的 ,新奇的 ”正确 。 其次 , 开篇句也已概括说明研究发现 “当在 一 个 新的地方(anew place) 睡觉时 ,你的大脑有 一 半会保持警惕 ”, 这和本空格句相呼应 , 因此完全确定 与 new 近义的 novel正确 。
classified、marine、potential与上文语境不符 ,文中并未提及“分类的 、海洋的或潜在的 ”环境 。
　　【点拨技巧】科普类文章往往会在 “详细介绍研究发现 ”之后 “给出研究者的解释 、提炼 ”, 常见引出  结构 为  the researchers/research suggest( suggests、suggested)/indicate explain/reveal/demonstrate that. . . , 阅读时可借其把握层次 ,并关注二者对应关系 。
30.  答案:I) potential
　　【确定词性】根据空格所在位置 any    30    danger可推断其为 “形容词 、ed分词 、ing分词 或 单数名 词 ”,可选范围 :A) classified、D)exotic、E)identified、F)inherent、G)marine、I) potential。
　　【锁定答案】空格句指出“大脑部分保持警觉 , 以便人们可以保 护 自 己 免 受 任 何          危险 ”。保持警 觉的目的往往是预防潜在的 、可能的威胁 ,potential“潜在的 ,可能发生的 ”正确 。
　　　A) classified“分类的 ”与 danger无法搭配 ;D)exotic“异国的 ”、G)marine“海洋的 ”上文未提及相关信 息 ; F)inherent“内在的(危险) ”找不到从属对象(谁的内在危险) 。
　　【点拨技巧】假若考生不知 exotic的具体含义“异域风情的 ,外国情调的(含褒义) ”,而是知道它大概 指“外来的 ,外在的 ”,则很容易认为 它 可 以 和 danger语义搭配合理 ,从而误选此项 。 故提醒考生: 学习 词汇时不能只知“大概意思 ”,而是要知“准确含义 ”。
　　【补充语法】so that用法 : 1.   引导目的状语 从 句 ( 功用等同于  in order that, 意为 “为了 , 目的是  …… ”) ,从句谓语中常用情态动词 may/might、can/could、should、would等 ,表示尚未完成的目的或意  图 ,如本段 ③句 。2. 引导结果状语从句(功用相当 于 so,意为 “因此 ,所以 ”) , so that从句常用逗号同主  句隔开 ,有明显 的 “结果 、完成 ”意味 。 如 : He made a wrong decision, so that half ofhis lifetime was wasted. (他做了错误的决定 , 因此毁掉了半生) 。

31. 答案:E) identified
　　【确定词性】空格所在从句结构为“主语(the“first-night-effect”) 十系动词/完成时(hasbeen) 十      in humans”,空格词有三种情形 :1. ed分词(构成现在完成时的被动语态) ;2. 形容词或不可数 名 词(作 主系表结 构的表语) ; 3. ing分词 (构成现在完成进行时)。 综合三种情形 , 空格处可选范围 : A) classified、D)exotic、E)identified、F)inherent、G)marine。
　　【锁定答案】空格句指出 :这是第一次在人类身上不同大脑状态 下 的 “首夜效应 ”。下文转而指 出 :但“首夜效应 ”并不是第一次被发现 ,一些动物也显示出这种现象 。故空格也应 该 体 现 出 “(第 一 次) 被发现 、被识别 ”之意 ,E)identified正确 。
　　　D)exotic“外来的 、异国的 ”、F)inherent“内在的 ”、G)marine“海洋的 ”语义无法衔接 。A) classified填 入空格 ,与下文无法构成转折逻辑 。
　　【点拨技巧】若两句关系为“转折/对比 ”(体现为 however, but, although等),需重点关注两句间“差 异的集中体现 ”、并意识到其他背 景 信 息 大 致 同 指 。如本段 ①②句 :对比两句可发现 ,差异集中体现于 is. . . in humans,可推测其大致语义“这是第一次在人类身上看到 ,但(总体上)并非第一次看到 ”,从而推 测空格词应与 seen近义 。
32. 答案 : L) species
　　【确定词性】some animal   32  also display this phenomenon 主干成分看似完整 ,但主语  some animal为单数 ,而谓语 play为原形 ,故判断 animal为修饰成分 ,空格为 名词复数 做句子主语 。可选范  围 :J)predators、L)species、N)varieties。
　　【锁定答案】空格上文讨论“人的首夜效应 ”,空格句指出 :一些动物          也显示出这种现象 ,下文则 以海豚为例进行说明 。 因此 animal      整体应表示 “动物们 ”之意 ,species符合文意 ,animal species意 为“各动物物种 ”。
　　　predators“捕食者 ,掠夺者 ”与下文关于海豚的举 例 不 相 符 ,无论从常识上还是从下文看 ,都可知海 豚并非动物捕食者 ,可排除 。varieties虽也能表示“种类 ,品种 ”,似乎符合空格要求 ,但 varieties实际指 的是“某一类别/物种中的不同品种 ”(如 :The lakehasmorethan20varietiesoffish. 那个湖里有二十多

种鱼) ,不符合文中 animal和 dolphins的关系 。 注 :animalvarieties指“某种动物或某些动物的新品种 ”,  如 :Farmers continually created new animal varieties by selecting who survived to breed, thus handing Charles Darwin an idea.  农民们选那些幸存下来的继续繁殖 ,不断创造出动物新 品 种(注 :新品种的鸡 、 猪等) ,这给了查尔斯达尔文一个启示 。
　　【点拨技巧】“根据上下文推知事物之间的逻辑关系 ”是确定 “名词性选项 ”的有效思路 。如本题 :若 根据上下文(主要体现于 however体现的转折逻辑以及 For example体现的例证关系) 推知 animal	 和 humans的之间的“相对关系 ”以及和 dolphins的“包含关系 ”,则很容易确定答案 。
33.  答案:G) marine
　　【确定词性】根据空格所在位置 other    33    animals可知其为 animals的修饰限定成分 ,可能是“形 容词 、ed分词 、ing分词或名词 ”,可选范围 :A) classified、D)exotic、F)inherent、G)marine。
　　【锁定答案】“dolphins, aswellasother             animals(海豚 , 以及其他         动物) ”暗含之意 :空格词 应体现“海豚和其他动物的共同特 征 、属性 ”,marine符合文意 : 海豚属于 “海洋类 ”动物 。 另外 , 下文的 具体描述中 ,drown(淹死 ,溺死) 也表明这是在描述“水中情形 ”,可确定答案 。
　　　inherent“内在的 ”、classified“分类的 ”与 animals无法衔接 ; exotic“外来的 ,异国的 ”不符合上下文语 境(文中没有任何信息表明海豚是异域动物) 。
34.  答案:B) consciously
　　【确定词性】宾语从句主干成分完整 :dolphins(主语) 十control(谓语) 十theirbreathing(宾语) ,故推 断空格需填入副词做状语 。 可选范围 :B)consciously、C)dramatically。
　　【锁定答案】空格所在句指出 ,海豚总是          控制呼吸 。 下句指出 :如果睡觉时不保持大脑活跃 ,它 们就有可能会溺死 。 可见 ,两句间为解 释 说 明 关 系 : 海豚控制呼吸是故意的 、有意识的行为 , 意在防止 溺水 ,B) consciously符合文意 。C) dramatically“戏剧性地 ;显著地 ”无法衔接空格前后 。
35.  答案:J) predators
　　【确定词性】根据空格所在位置 they can lookoutfor    35    while asleep可判断其为 名词 作宾语 。 可选范围 :J) predators、N)varieties。
　　　【锁定答案】空格所在 句 指 出 ,海豚睡觉时眼睛睁开是为了留意(lookoutfor 意为 “小心 , 留意 , 提 防 ”)         ,可见 ,predators“捕食 者 , 掠夺者 ”符合文意 。 另外 ,上文在介绍关于 “人 ”的类似研究时指出 “人们到了新环境 , 睡觉时会保持 部 分 大 脑 警 觉 , 以便保护自己免受危险 ”,predators显然属于 “重大危 险 ”,故正确 。varieties“种类 ”无法与 lookoutfor搭配 ,且不符合语义要求 。
　　【补充语法】while(当…… 时) 引导时间状语从句时 ,如果主句和从句主语 一 致 ,则从句中可省略主 语和 be动词 ,变形为“while十现在分词 、过去分词 、名词 、形容词或介词短语 ”,如本句中 while asleep。

　　　[ D]   0  Most  of  the  training  for  advanced-math 	competitions happens outside the confines①      of the normal 	school day.  @students attend after-school clubs,  summer 	camps,  online forums②      and classes,  and university-based “math circles,”to prepareforthe competitions.
　　　[E]  0One of the largest feeders③    for high school math competitions—including those that eventually lead to  the  IMO—is  a  middle  school  program   called Mathcounts.   @ About100, 000  students around the country participate in the program,s competition series,  which culminates④   in a national game-show-style contest held each May.  ΘThe most recent one took place last week in washington,  D. c.   41  ④ students join a team  through their schools,  which provide a volunteer coach
and pay a nominal⑤    fee to send students to regional and state competitions.  ΘThe224students who make it to the national competition getan all-expenses-paid trip.


　　　[F]  0Nearly all members of last year,s winning U. s.   IMo  team  took part in Mathcounts as middle school students,  as did Loh,  the coach.   @ 36    “Middle schoolis an important age because students have enough
math capability⑥    to solve advanced problems,  but they haven,t really decided what they want to do with their lives,”saidLoh.  Θ“They often gethooked⑦    then. ”
　　　[G]   39  0 Another influential feeder for advanced- math students is an online school called Art ofproblem  solving, which began about13 years ago and now has 15, 000 users.   @ students use forums to chat,  play games, and solve problems together at no cost, or they can pay a few  hundred dollars to take courses with trained teachers.  ΘAccording to Richard Rusczyk, the company founder,  the six U.  s.   team  members who competed at the IMo last year collectively⑧    took more than40 courses on the site.  ④parents ofadvanced-math students andMathcounts coaches saythe children areon the website constantly.
　　　[H]  0There are also dozens of summer camps—  many attached to universities—that aim to prepare elite math  students.    45  @  some  are  pricey— a  three-week intensive⑨   program can cost$4, 500or more—but most offer scholarships.

　　　④⑤句重评论 ,指出“美国时尚/现代 着装规范 ”相较 “巴黎时尚/传统权威时尚 ”的进步:具有民主 性(遵循女性意愿)。logical and answerable to the willofthe women(answerable to sth意为 “对某物负 责的 ;适合某物的 ”)、addressed a democracy(address意为“设法解决 、满足 ”) 凸显美国时尚的合理性 、民 主性 ;prescriptive and imposed on women, willing or not(prescriptive意为 “规定性的 ,指定性的 ”,与 democratic相对)述出传统巴黎式时尚的规范性 、强制性 。
　　【段落深层解读】本段主旨为“介绍并评述时尚界的重大历史事件 ”,难词非常之多 ,考场之上难以  完全读懂 。对此需抓大放小:1、借 liberatedA from the confines ofB(将 A 从 B 的桎梏中解放出来) 和  independence(独立) 的同义呼应意识到本段讲述事件为 “美国女性设计师脱离传统法国时尚 ,创立美国  时尚/现代 着装规范 ”,段落关键词为 American fashion/the modern dress code(与之相对 的 是 parisian design/paris-based fashion)。2、借  letting. . . allowing. . . and prizing. . . 的详释 , 以及段末 两 句 的 对 比  (集中体现于 whereas) ,明确美国时尚完全不同于传统巴黎时尚的鲜明特征 。

①②句指出 ,品牌运动装(designersportswear)是美国时尚独立于欧洲品味的开端。
　　　①句反向铺垫、强调早期美国时尚对巴 黎 时 尚 的 “遵循 ”。三个动词 followed(遵循)、copied(复制 , 模仿)、pirated(抄袭 ,剽窃)强调早期美国时尚对传统时尚的亦步亦趋 。
　　　②句转折、引出美国品牌运动服装对巴黎时尚的 “打破 ”。was notmodeled on thatofEurope(that 回指 designer sportswear)和 itwas genuinelyinvented anddeveloped in America一正一 反 ,共同强调美   国品牌运动装是“真正的美国造 ”(genuinely意为“真正地 ,名副其实地 ”,起强调作用)。
③-⑦句具体介绍美国品牌运动装的设计特点。
　　　③句指出其设计师 特 点 — 并 不 是 配 有 一 系列辅助人员的高端设计师  (were not high-end with supplementary lines),言外之意是美国品牌运动装和巴黎时尚的对比 :“亲民 、实用 ”Vs“高端 ,精致 ”。

　　　四句为总(④句) —分(⑤⑥句) — 总(⑦句) :先指出无论是设计目的和商业承诺都指向“运动装 ”(言 外之意 :实用性是首要的) ,其鲜明特点是解决问题的独创 性 和 现 实 生 活 中 的 实 用 性 ;随后具体说明其 特征“方便打理 ,门襟简单实用 ,穿衣方便等 ”;最后概括指出美国设计师珍视应变能力 以及着装者的灵 活自由 。
　　【段落深层解读】本段整体为“总分 ”结构 : ①句铺垫 — ②句引领全段(引出美国突破传统时尚的  先锋“品牌运动装 ”) — ③至 ⑦句具体 描 述 。阅读时重在 :1. 从 ①②句 “早 期的美国时尚 一 直哈法 ,但  品牌运动装不再效仿欧洲模式 ”意识到 :designer sportswear代表着上段  liberated American fashion from the confinesofparisian design的开端 。2. 本段 ③-⑦句所描述的“美国品牌运动装的特征 ”(实用的  运动装 ,方便打理 ,穿脱方便 ,珍视穿衣者的自由) 与上段 ③④⑤句所述 “美国时尚的总体特征 ”应该 一  致 ,可结合理解 。3. 前两段重在说明现象“美国时 尚 不 再 ‘哈法 9 , 打造出全新风格的运动装 ,建立了独  立的美国时尚 ,并确立了现代着装规范 ”。显然 ,这一现象意义重大 ,必有特定的驱动因素 ,预测下文会  进行分析 。

C) Itrepresented genuine American art.	C) 它代表真正的美国艺术 。
D) Itwas a completely new invention.	D) 它是一项全新的发明 。
　　　[精准定位] 本题考查“美国品牌运动装 ”的相关信息 。 由名称关键词 American designersportswear 先大致定位至第二 、三 、四段 ,随后需根据选项分别具体定位 。
　　　[锁定答案] D)。第二段 ②句指出品牌运动装并非效仿欧洲模式,它是真正在美国发明并发展起来 的 ,D项符合此信息,completely new invention近义对应 genuinelyinvented anddevelopedin America。
　　　[排除 干 扰] A 项与第二段 ②句 “设计师运动装不是仿效的欧洲模式(was notmodeled on that of 	Europe) ”完全相悖 。B项将第二段 末 句 “美国品牌运动装珍 视 女 性 自 由 (the freedom ofwomen) ”改为   “女性之美(women,s beauty) ”,由第三段 ③④句可知该选项实为偷梁换柱 :注重女性之美是 “传统巴黎   时尚 ”的特点 。C项利用第四段 ③句 a genuine design art设置干扰 ,但由该句只能推知美国品牌运动装   是一种设计艺术 ,无法推出它是美国艺术的代表(represent意为“代表 ,成为典型/象征 ”)。
　　　[提炼思路] 本题考查事实细节 ,对于文章跨度范围较大 ,且根据题干只能确定信息搜索的大范围 , 解题关键在于根据各选项中关键词分别具体定位 ,并进行比对(正确项是对原文信息的概括总结或同  义改写 ;干扰项 则常常以文中词汇 增 大 干 扰 ,却暗中偷梁换柱或篡改语义) :先定位 ,A 项  European model复现第二段 ②句 modeled on thatofEurope,B项 women,s beauty复现第三段 ④句 pure beauty,C 项 genuine和  art复 现 第 四 段 ③ 句  a genuine design art, D 项  new invention 复 现 第 二 段 ② 句  was genuinelyinvented;然后逐一比对 ,A反向干扰 ,B偷梁换柱 ,C扭曲语义 ,只有 D 同义改写 ,可确定答案  为 D项 。

第三段论述美国的品牌运动服装所蕴含的“实用主义着装理念 ”O
　　　①句说明后来人对于(当初)这些女性设计师的时尚创新的看法:她们将 “自己的服 装 价 值 观 ”呈现  为了一种 “新的风格 ”。Many have argued 引出后人对当时女 性 设 计 师 的 评 价 。 their own clothing values表面指的是设计师的着装价值观 ,映射 的是当时女性的价值观 。anew style指完全不同于传统  巴黎时尚的新风格(美国风格)。
　　　②句退步承认 ,这种看法在上世纪三、四十年代可能是超前的(言外之意 : 当时的人们、甚至设计师  本人都可能并未意识到 ,这是后来人们回看历史得出的观点)O much ofthisargument、justifying apparel on the basis ofutility(根据实用性来论证服装的合理性) 回应 ①句所述 “后来 人的评判视角 ”;there was little orno experience则说明当时人们尚不具备这种“基于实用性来论证服装的合理性 ”的视角(为后文   提及传统时尚的“纯美标准 ”埋下伏笔)。
　　　③④⑤句再次转回 ①句 ,论述这些女性设计师的创新:弱化传统的审美性标 准 ,引入新的实用性标 准 O 三个近义关键词 castaside(抛弃)、slighted(轻视)、other than(不同于 ,而非) 凸显核心语义 “破除传 统标准 ”。
　　　③句作者表明观点:美国设计师既 然 把 巴 黎 抛 在 了 一 边 ,那么肯定也在 一 定程度上弱化了美的传 统 O 由本句因果关联“摒弃巴黎时尚原则意味着传统审美观念受到轻视 ”可反推得知 : 巴黎式时尚非常 注重“美(beauty) ”。
　　　④句进而指出美国品牌运动装引入新的考 量 因 素:诠释设计师的现实生活 O pure beauty(纯美) 呼 应上句 the tradition ofbeauty,指向巴黎时尚的纯粹审美性标准 。分号后则明确指出验证美国运动装的 另一新标准(verifiedby a standard other than. . . ) :设计师的生活方式(也即该时期女性的现实生活需 求)。其中 this relation指代前一分句内容 ;crude version(粗略版本 ,大概版本) 暗示还有其他因素 。
　　　⑤句补充指出品牌运动装也必然考虑了“消费者需求 ”O as well(也 , 同样地) 表明 ④⑤两句并列逻 辑 :“设计师的生活 ”和“消费 者 的 需 求 ”均不同于传统的 “纯美标准 ”。ultimately(最终的 ,最高 的) 言外 之意 :消费者需求才是最高标准 。
　　【段落深层解读】本段阅读有两个难点:1、段落层次 : Manyhave argued that. . . ofcourse, much of this argumentin the1930s-40s was. . . Ifparis was castaside构成多重转折 、体现本段的 “回顾 、评判历   史 ”角度 : ①句概述后来人对于(当初)这些女性设计师的时尚创新的看法 — ②句退步承认 ,这种看法   在上世纪三四十年代可能过于超前 — ③④⑤句再次转回论述 ①句 。2. 段中关联:a designer,s life指   女性设计师的生活方式 ,consumer代表着消费者的需求 ,二者既是影响设计的不同因素 ,又共同合成了   该时期女性的(不同于传统的“纯美标准 ”的)着装价值观 。

48.   what  characterized  American  designer sportswear?	48. 哪项符合美国设计师运动装的特点?
A) pursuitofbeauty.	A) 对美的追求 。
B) Decorative closings.	B) 装饰性的门襟 。
C) Ease of care.	C) 方便打理 。
D) Fabric quality.	D) 面料材质 。


　　　[精准定位] 本题依旧考查“设计师运动装的主要特点 ”, 只不过层面较上 一 题更低 、更细 。 同上题 类似 , 由题干关键词 American designer sportswear先定位至第二 、三段 , 随后按选项分别具体定位 。
　　　[锁定答案]c) 。根据第二段 ⑤句可知“方便打理(Ease of care) 是当时设计师设计运动装时的重要 考虑因素 ”,C项正确 。
　　　[ 排除干扰] A项源自第三段多次复现的 women、beauty等词 ,但  “注重女性之美是 “传统巴黎时 尚 ”的特点,而非品牌运动装(美国时尚) 的特点 ”。B项利用第二段 ⑥句 closings干扰 ,但将 closings的 设计特点“简 单实用 ”(simple, practical) 篡改为 “起装饰作用 ”(decorative) 。 D 项 根据第二段 ⑤句 . . .  were chiefly cotton设置干扰 Fabric quality,但此部分信息意在说明“夏季的棉质面料易于打理(例证强 调“易于打理 ”) ”并非说明其“面料质量 ”。
　　　[ 提炼思路] 本题同上题设问类似 ,但 设 问方向更集中 : 统 一 指向 “美国品牌运动装的具体特点 ”。 两题解题思路也相似 ,只不过本题需要更加提防命题人的 “偷梁换柱 ”或 “断章取义 ”(应对之策在于 ,借   助“美国品牌运动装的整体特征 — 实用性 ”以及前后 逻辑进行判断) : A把 “传统时尚 ”的特点偷换给   “美国品牌运动装 ”;B偷换 closing的特点 ; D则对 cotton断章取义 ,只有 C是“美国品牌运动装 ”的明确   特点(且符合其总体特征) 。

C) A search forbalance between tradition and novelty.	C) 寻求传统与新颖之间的平衡 。
D) The involvementofmore women in fashion design.	D) 更多女性参与时尚设计 。
　　　[精准定位] 本题考查“美国女装设计在特定时期的特点 ”。结合名称关键词 the design ofwomen,s apparel和时间关键词 the1930s-40s定位到第三段 。
　　　[锁定答案]A) 。第三段 ①②句指出 “当时的女性设计师能把超前的理念 ‘实用性(utility)9 呈现到 服装设计中 ”, ③④句 则 具体说明女装设计从传统时尚  “纯美 、唯审美标 准(pure beauty) ”到现代时尚 “引入实用性标准 ”的转变 ,A项是对这一变化的正确概括 。
　　　[ 排除干扰] B项将 ④句“模拟设计师生 活(the emulation of a designer,s life) ”偷换为 “模拟传统巴 黎设计 ”,而 美国设计师实则是 “抛弃了巴黎设计 ( ③句  paris was cast aside) ”。C 项错在两点 : 1.  	tradition and novelty错误 — 文中关注点并非“传统和新 颖 ”而是 “美和实用 ”(虽然文中表明 “传统 ”即 “纯美 ”,但“新颖 ”不等于“实用 ”) ;2.  search forbalance偏差 — 与 ①③句事实“美国女装设计抛弃了巴 黎时尚 、完全是创新事物 ”不符 。D项将 ①句“女性设计师得以把自己的新理念运用到时尚设计中 ”曲解 为“更多女性参与时尚设计 ”,原文并未论及时尚设计师的性别比重变化 。
　　　[ 提炼思路] 本题考查对段落信息的概括 推 理 能 力 。 解题关键在于梳理句间逻辑 , 明确语义关联 : 首先明确题干所问“美国的女装设计发生的变化 ”与第三段 ①句 “女性设计师将新理念运用到 新 的 时 装 风格中(变化) ”实为同指 ,再根据 ②句“实用性理念在当时是超前的 ”推断出 :传统时尚以“纯美 ”为标准 , 美国设计师则考虑“实用 ”标准 。 ③④句则论述指出当时设计 师 运 动 装 “抛弃巴黎时尚 、仿效现实生活 方式(实用性) ”。 由此可明确“变化 ”内容 :弱化了传统的“审美性 ”,开始重视超前的“实用性 ”。

　　　[排除干扰] A项由第四段 ③句 answering to the demanding needs of service 以及 ⑤句 which was both made for the masses 主观推断设计师 “迎合年轻人的口味 ”, 实际上这是在说明设计师注重 “实用  性 ”,文中并未提及年轻人的消费品味 。B项对 ②③句“传统认为时尚是对美的追求 ,而美式运动装设计  师们证明时尚不仅是美 ”过度推导 , 由此不能推知 “人们对美的认识 ”发生了改变 。 D项对 ④句 “美式运  动装设计师确定了 20世纪后期的时尚航向 ”过度推断 ,文中虽强调美国设计师的影响 ,但并未提及其与  巴黎同行的竞争 。
　　　[提炼思路] 本题考查对事实细节的概括推理 。 解题时先根据题干关键词 designers ofAmerican sportswear划定大体搜索范围(第四段) ;然后再在信息搜索范围内寻找与每个选项的关键词相对应的  信息点,并仔细比对原文和选项 :A项 They catered to the taste对应 ③句 answering to the. . .  needs,但  捏造原文没有的信息 the youngergeneration。B项 conceptofbeauty对应 ②句 a pursuitofbeauty,但改  变原文方向 :改变的是“对时尚(fashion) 的看法 ”, 而不是 “对美(beauty) 的看法 ”。C 项 equity between men and women对应 ⑤句 gender equity,且 advocated 明确 were the pioneers暗含之意 。D项没有明显  对应词 ,检索未发现“美国设计师与巴黎同行竞争 ”相关信息 。故确定选 C项 。

51.  whatistheimpactofrubbish dumpson wildlife?	51.  垃圾堆对野生动物有什么影响?
A)  They have forced white storks to search for safer winter shelters.	A) 它们迫使白鹳寻找更安全的过冬地 。
B)  They have seriously polluted the places where birds spend winter.	B) 它们严重污染了鸟类过冬的地方 。
C)   They  have  accelerated  the  reproduction  of  some harmfulinsects.	C) 它们加速了一些有害昆虫的繁殖 。
D)  They have changed the previous migration habits of certain birds.	D) 它 们 改 变 了 某 些 鸟 类 先 前 的 迁 徙 习惯 。
[精准定位] 本题概括 考 查 “垃圾堆对野生动物的影响 ”。根据题干关键词 the impact of rubbish

dumps on wildlife定位至第一段(rubbish dumps. . . constitute. . . impacts. . . on wildlife) 。
　　　[锁定答案] D) 。第一段 ①句指出 ,垃圾堆对野生动物的影响令人不安 , ②③句具体说明 :导致一些   鸟类冬季不再迁徙 、不再 飞行数千里去觅食 ,D) 正确 ,They have changed the previous migration habits of certain birds. 是对 Theyhaveled somebirds togiveuponmigration以及Insteadofflyingthousandsof miles . . . , they. . . 的同义改写 。
　　　[ 排除干扰] A项与原文变化相反 :垃圾堆使得白鹳“放弃原有迁徙习惯 ,来垃圾场觅食过冬 ”,而不  是“离开 原 来居住地 , 去寻找更安全的地方过冬 ”。B 项由第二段  feeding on food waste,  and the multitudesofinsectsthatthrive句主观推断“垃圾堆污染了鸟类过冬之地(haveseriouslypolluted. . . ) ”,  但实际上是 “垃圾堆提供了鸟类冬季觅 食 之 地 ”(feeding on food waste. . . ) 。 C项利用第二段 ②句  the multitudes ofinsectsthatthriveon thedumps干扰 ,但这仅说明“垃圾堆上虫子大量繁殖 ”,无法推出“垃  圾堆加速了虫子的繁殖 ”,accelerated the reproduction无中生有 。
　　　[ 提炼思路] 对于选项较长的情形 ,应首先将选项信息分类 。如本题四个选项中 ,名词性信息(white storks、the placeswherebirds spendwinter、the reproduction ofsomeharmfulinsects、previousmigration habitsof certain birds)体现  “选项小话题 ”, 主要用于定位原文 , 动词性信息 (have forced. . . to search for. . . 、have seriouslypolluted、haveaccelerated、havechanged)带有“作者观点性”,用于取舍判断 。

　　　[ 排除干扰] A项对第三段 ②③句“鸟类在垃圾场能更方便地觅得大量食物 ”过度推导出 “白鹳会永   远留在垃圾场 ”,但文中仅表明垃圾场是鸟类的过冬地之 一 ,并未说明它们度过冬天后仍会留在这里 。 C项将第四段 ②句 The birds can easily eatpieces of plastic or rubberbands断章取义为 “演变出新的食   性 ”,但原文意在指出“它们可能会误食这些致其死亡的东西(and they candie) 。 D项与第三段 ④句 “它   们有大量有机垃圾可以食用 ”完全相反 。
　　　[ 提炼思路] 本题所考查的人物观点分散于文中多处,对此需将其多个小观点一一概括后再与选项   比较 、进行判断 :将 Flack 出现 在 第 三 、四 、七段的观点分别概括为 “垃圾场食物丰富 、鸟类觅食方便 ”、 “垃圾场的食物可能有害 ,不利于鸟类健康 ”及“鸟类能控制昆虫数量 ,有益生态平衡 ”,便能很快地选出   正确项 B。

(固定句式“某地/某时 十see/witness十sth”意为“某地/某时见证了…… 的发  生 ;某地/某时是…… 发生的地点/时间 ”) ,此句型需要把“最早使用火药 ”和“发明了活字印刷 ”转译为名  词形式 the first/earliestuse ofgunpowder和 the invention ofmovable-type printing。
5. ①人口增长迅速 , ②越来越多的人住进城市 ,那里有热闹的娱乐场所 。
　　　[ 词汇 准 备] 人 口  population; 热 闹 的  lively; bustling; 娱 乐 场 所  entertainment quarter;  place of entertainment; place of amusement
　　　[句子解析]本句介绍宋朝时期的人口和城市化 , 可划分为两个意层 ,译为两个并列分句 , 以连词  and或分号连接 。 意层 ①介绍人口 ,根据语境可确定句首“人口 ”特指宋朝的人口 ,句子根据汉语的意合  习惯省略了“宋朝/这个时期 ”,而英语 讲 求 形 合 , 翻译时需把省略信息 “宋朝/这个时期 ”以具体形式表  现出来 , 比如可译为后置定语 The population duringthis time grew rapidly或状 语 The population grew rapidlyduringthistime。 意层 ②介绍城市化 ,逗号后“那里有…… ”是对逗号前 “城市 ”的补充说明 ,故可  把逗号前“越来越多的人住进城 市 ”译为主句 ,把逗号后 “那里有热闹的娱乐场所 ”译为 修 饰 cities的定  语从句 which had lively entertainmentquarters或 where there were. . . 。
6. 社会生活多种多样 。人们聚集在一起观看和交易珍贵艺术品 。
　　　[ 词汇准备] 多种多样 rich and varied;聚集在 一 起 gather;交易 trade;珍贵 precious; valuable; 艺术 品 artwork
　　　[ 句子解析]两小句介绍宋朝的社会 生 活 , 前句概述 , 后句举例 , 两句为解释说明关系 , 可译为以分 号或冒号连接的两个分句 。第一小句的深层结构为系表句型 “社会生活是多种多样的 ”,可直译为系表 句 social life was rich and varied;同上句类似 ,此句“社会生活 ”特指宋朝的社会生活 ,故需补译出 “宋朝 时期 ”这一信息 ,可译为 during the song dynasty。第二小句包含两组动词短语“聚集在一起 ”和 “观看和 交易艺术品 ”,后者可理解为前者 的 目 的 ,可把 “聚集在 一 起 ”译 为谓语 ,“观看和交易艺术品 ”译为目的 状语(不定式结构 todo sth可以表示谓语动作的目的) 。
7. 宋朝的政府体制在当时也是先进的 。政府官员均通过竞争性考试选拔任用 。

26. 答案:F) focused
　　【确定词性】空格位于系动 词 remain之后 ,可填入 “形容词、ing分词、ed分词 ”作表语 ,可选范围 : D)claiming、E)dedicated、F)focused、H)instructed、J)sealed、M)uttering。
　　　【锁定答案】可选范围中在语义上能与 those (people) who remain. . . better搭配的只有  dedicated “满腔热忱的 、有献身精神的 ”和 focused“专注的 ,集中注意力的 ”。由常识可判断 ,相比于 “献身精神 、热  忱热情 ”,“爱自言自语 ”与“专注度 ”的关联性更强 ,故选择 focused。
　　【点拨技巧】本题 dedicated干扰 性 较 强 ,空格所在句甚至第 一 段均没有能将其 完 全 排 除 的 可 靠 依     据 ,此时可先将其标记存 疑 ,从后文寻找更多线索 。 阅读全文后会发现 ,文中没有出现任何与 “(对事     业 、任务等等)具有献身精神的 、满腔热忱的 ”相关信息 ,却存在大量直接或间接与 “专注度 、学习 、思维 ” 相 关的内容(如第二段 helpspeople function quicker、第四段 help augmentthinking等) ,这时可返回来确     认本题选 focused正确无误 。
　　【补充语法】remain、stay、continue、keep、hold等系动词可接形容词、ed分词、或 ing分词 ,表示状态的 持续 。如本题的 remain focused。又如 :The brain needs to be active to stay young. (大脑需要活跃起来 以保持年轻 。)

27. 答案:L) trigger
　　【确定词性】空格位于不定式结构 usesth to        中 ,名词 mental pictures之前 ,因此应填入 及物 动词的原形 ,可选范围 :G)incur、L)trigger。
　　【锁定答案】空格所在句大意为 ,“利用口头提示               记忆图像 ”这一行为有助于人脑更快地运转 , 可见 trigger“引发 ,触发 ”符合此处语义 。
　　　incur“招致 ,蒙受[成本 、债务 、罚款等] ”所接宾语通常 带 有 消 极 含 义 ,而                mental pictures是 有益行为(helps people function quicker) ,因此不合语义要求 。
　　【点拨技巧】选词填空不仅要关注词 的 词 性、搭配、基本含义 ,有时还需辨别词的褒贬色彩、甚至褒 贬程度 。如本题 ,正确项必须顺应上下文 ,体现“积极 、褒义色彩 ”。

28. 答案:O) volunteers
　　【确定词性】空格位于双宾语结构 show sth to sb 中 ,数词 twenty之后 ,应填入 名词复数 ,可选范围 : K)spectators、O)volunteers。
　　【锁定答 案】空格所在句描述的是 一 项实验(In one experiment) 中 ,研究者(they) 对  twenty 	 (them)所作指示 。可以推知 ,空格处为“实验的参与者 ”,volunteers“志愿者 、主动参与者 ”为正确项 。文中 丝毫未提及“表演 、观众 ”等信息 ,排除 spectators“观众 ”。
　　　补充:表示“研究中的受试对象、参与者 ”的词汇有 :volunteers( 自愿参加者) , participants(参加者) , subjects(受试对象) , respondents(被调查者)等 。
29. 答案:H) instructed
　　【确定词性】由空格所在位置 Halfwere        to repeatoutloud判断其可能为 :1. 形容词(构成主系 表结构) ;2. ing分词 (构成过去进行时) ;3. ed分词 (构成被动语态) ”。综合三种情况 ,可选范围 :D) claiming、E)dedicated、H)instructed、J)sealed、M)uttering。
　　【锁定答案】空格所在句意为“半数(实验参与者)        大声重复自己要找的物品 ”,填入后符合语义 的只有 instructed,该词与系动词 were构成被动语态 ,表示“被指示 ,被吩咐 ”。
　　　claiming“宣称 ,主张 ”、dedicated“有献身精神的 ;被献身 ”、sealed“封闭的 ;被密封 ”与  repeat不搭 。 uttering“说出 ,发出(声音) ”与 repeat存在一定的语义重复 。
　　【点拨技巧】“语义场(多个紧密联系的词语聚合成的一个语义系统)”对于解答选词填空题可以起到 重要作用 。如 ,本段 ①②句中  showed、asked、were       to repeat很明显形成了一个“实验者向受试对象 发指令 ”的语义场 ,从而很容易可以选定 instructed.
30. 答案:J) sealed
　　【确定词性】由空格所在位置 kepttheirlips        判断其可能为“形容词、ing分词、ed分词 ”,可选范 围 :D)claiming、E)dedicated、J)sealed、M)uttering。
　　【锁定答案】联系 ②③句可知 , ③句 Those who talked to themselves和 those who didn,t分别对应 ②句 (空格所在句)的 Halfwereinstructedtorepeatoutloud和theotherhalfkepttheirlips        ,所以空格应填入 表示“关闭 ,闭上”的词(即 ,受试对象一半“大声重复”,一半“不重复/闭口不言”),sealed符合此处语义。
claiming“宣称 ,主张 ”、dedicated“有献身精神的 ;被献 身 ”、uttering“说出 ,发出 (声音) ”均与  lips

不搭 。
　　【补充语法】感官/意愿动词(see, observe, notice, watch, hear, smell, listen to, look at, feel, find, want, wish等)和使役/致使动词(catch, set, have, make, get, keep等)可接过去分词作宾语补足语 。如  本文中 kept(使役动词) their lips(宾语) sealed(宾补)。 又如 :soldiers should report to the leadership when they noticethesituation changed. (士兵若注意到情况有变 ,应向上级报告 。)
31. 答案:M) uttering
　　【确定词性】由空格所在位置 . . . found that        the name of. . . helped quicken someone,space判 断其 与 名 词 短 语  the name of. . . 一 并 构 成   that 从 句 的 主 语 , 应 填 入  ing 分 词 , 可 选 范 围 : D) claiming、M)uttering。
　　【锁定答案】空格所在句大意为 “寻找某种常见物品时               其名称有助于加快寻找速度 ”,可见  uttering“讲出 ,说出 ,发出(声音) ”符合此处 语 义 。此外 , 由该句后半部分(but)talking about uncommon items. . . 可反向推知 ,空格处应填入与 talking语义相近 、形式相同的词 ,进一步确认答案为 uttering。
　　　claiming意为 “宣称 , 索要 ,夺去 ”, 所接宾语往往为 “权利 , 责任 , 钱/福利 , 生命 (responsibility/ benefit/300lives) ”,不能衔接空格前后 。

32. 答案:A) apparently
　　【确定词性】 由空格所在位置 when you,ve        matured,可判断其为谓语 have matured的修 饰 成分 ,应填入副词 ,可选范围 :A)apparently、I)obscurely。
　　【锁定答案】have apparently matured语义搭配合理 ,意为 “明显成熟/成年 ”,和前一分句中 children 相对 。obscurely“晦涩地 ,隐晦地 ”则无法与 matured搭配 。
33. 答案:C) brilliance
【确定词性】空格位于名词短语 a greatsign of       中介词 of之后 ,可能是 “名词或 ing分词 ”,可
选范围 :B)arrogance、C)brilliance、D)claiming、K)spectators、N)volume。
　　【锁定答案】空格所在句 先 指 出 ,一 般研究对儿童自己将任务内容解释给自己听持 肯 定 态 度(help children learning) ,然后转折(although) 表达对成年人这样做的否定态度(not a great sign of        )。 据此推测空格应填入带有褒义的词 ,可选范围中只有 brilliance“才华 ,才智 ”符合语义 。
　　　arrogance“傲慢 ”在语义上可以和  a sign搭配 ,但该词为 贬义 , 与空格所在句的转折逻辑不合 。 claiming“宣称 ,主张 ”、spectators“观众 ”、volume“量 ;体积 ”均与  sign不搭 。
34. 答案:D) claiming
　　【确定词性】空格位于有完整结 构(主 十谓 十宾) 的主干之后 ,从句引导词 that之前 ,应填入 ing分 词 ,引领伴随状语 ,可选范围 :D)claiming。
　　　补充:从语法角度看 ,空格部分还可以填入名词 ,作 thatidea的同位语 ,后接 that引导的同位 语 从 句 。但若是这种情形 ,则回指 thatidea的表达必然也需要有冠词加以限定(如 a thought、the theory) ,本 题中空格前没有冠词 ,故填入名词的情况不作考虑 。
　　【锁定答 案】本 句 主 干 承 上 指 出 , 两 位 教 授 希 望 能 够 反 驳 先 前 惯 有 的 观 点 (that idea = that talking. . . nota greatsign ofbrilliance) ,claiming(宣称 ,主张)后接宾语从句详细介绍 两 位 教 授 观 点,符   合要求 。
　　【补充语法】ing分词作状语 ,表示具体方式(ing分 词与逻辑主语之间存在主动关系 )。 如本句 : claiming that. . . . 说明两位教授反驳惯有观点的具体内容 、方式 。

　　　[精准定位] 由 the decision of. . . 定位至第一 、二段(Tennessee,s technical and community colleges willnot. . . a decision. . . 、the decision notto. . . )。

　　　[排除干扰] B项从第二段 ②句“技术学院和社区学院 决定不推行州长提案 ”主观推出州长对此态 度强硬 ,但与第四段 ②句 “州长给予学院自主选择权 ”矛盾 。C项源于第四段 ①句 “(职工利益维护者认 为)执行外包计划有损职工利益”,但题干实为“校委会主席的决定(即不执行外包计划) ”。D项由第二段 ①句“高校设施管理支出远低于行业标准(故无需外包降成本) ”反向推出“不外包就会改善财务状况 ”。
　　　[提炼思路] 本题为事实细节题 ,实际考查首段长难句 ,解题需 :一 、认识到逗号后 a decision为同位  语 ,指代前面整句话 ,bolstered与选项 backed同义 ,故锁定 A项 ;二 、第二段 ②句再次出现 the decision, 而其后 not to move forward. . . proposal to privatize显然与首段  decision 内涵 一 致 (will not . . . to a

　A) private companies  play  a  big  role  in  campus management.	A) 私人公司在校园管理中扮演重要角色 。
B) Facilities management by colleges is more cost- effective.	B)  由学院进行设施管理更合算 。
C) Facilities management has  greatly  improved  in recentyears.	C) 设施管理近年来已大幅改善 。
D) Colleges  exercise  full  control  over  their  own financialaffairs.	D) 学院对其财务事宜实行完全控制 。
　　　[精准定位]  由  the campus spending analysis定 位 至 首 三 段 ( an analysis of spending at each campus. . . 、an internal analysis showed that. . . 、. . . based on this analysis) , 而首段为事后结论(分析结   果是决议的依据) ,第二 、三段回溯细节(In an email. . . , ChancellorJohn Morgan said. . . ) ,故锁定第二 、 三段 。
　　　[锁定答案] B)。第二段首句指出 Morgan对各校长的致信内容 : 内部分析结果显示 ,各高校在设施  管理上的支出已下降 , 当前远低于行业标准(fellwellbelow. . . ) ;第三段引述 Morgan原话阐明结论 :各  学院运营 很 高 效 、实行大规模外包 计 划 无 意 义 ( very efficiently、immaterial、raise the question of the value. . . ) ”,换句话说 ,维持现状 ,学院自主管理更划算 。

　　　[ 排除干扰]A项源于前两段重点信息“把高校管理外包给私企 、使公共建筑私有化(的计划) ”,但忽 视决定性内容“将不会执行外包计划(willnot、notto moveforward. . . ) ”。C项将第二段首句“各高校设 施管理支出下降 — 成本效益提升 ”偷换为“设施管理实现了大幅改善 — 设施效能提升 ”。D项从 “内 部分析显示各院校支出都低于行业标准(第二段 ①句) ”与 “学院可自主决定外包设施管理与 否(第四段 ②句) ”中主观推出“学院完全控制其财务事宜 ”,但“学院(除设施管理外的) 其它财务状况 ”并未提及 。
　　　[ 提炼思路] 本题为事实细节题 ,各项中关键词 private companies、Facilities management、Colleges、 financialaffairs(近义 spending) 均在定位意群中多次复现 ,造成解题难度 。 可以先忽略选项 ,聚焦题干 ,  大致思考关联 。本题题干为“各高校 设 施 管 理 开 销 的 分 析 数 据揭示的内容 ”, 而上题已知 “该分析是高   校不准备外包的依据 ”, 暗示分析结果的核心是“自主管理事实上要好过外包 ”,选项中 B项和 C项似乎   都符合这一推断 ,但后者无视“开销(问题) ”这一大前提 。A、D项均与“自主管理(比外包) 更好 ”无关 。

　　　[ 排除干扰] A项是“提案执行的直接结果 — 设施 管 理 外 包 给 私 企 ”, 而非 “职工支持者观点 ”。B 项由第四段首句“会使一些职工失去工作或福利 ”臆断出“会降低(所有) 职工的工作积极性 ”。D项将提  案“高校设施管理私有化 ”偷换为“高校设施私有化 ”,且不是职工拥护者观点 。
　　　[提炼思路] 命题人就“人物观点 ”设题 ,题干虽易于定位 ,但错误项干扰较大 ,解题需注意 :一 、锁定 考查的对象 ,如 A、D项均 涉 及 “提案内容/观点 ”, 而非题目所问的 “职工拥护者(提案批评者之 一) 观 点 ”;二 、切忌从细节信息进行过度 推 断 ,如 B项 “挫败职工工作积极性 ”看似有理 ,但 一 方面文中未提 , 另一方面作为提案批评者的主要论据 ,该内容的力度显然不够 。

C)  Hethoughtthe state,soutsourcingproposalwas simply unworkable.	
C) 他认为本州的外包提案完全是行不通的 。
D)  He opposed the governor,s plan to reconstruct the college board system.	
D) 他反对州长改组学院理事会系统的计划 。
　　　[精准定位]  由  John Morgan、resign可定位至第八段 ( Morgan said. . . he would retire. . . In his resignation letter. . . ) 。
　　　[锁定答案] D) 。第八段 ②句引 出 Morgan上周说辞 :他之所以将于 一 月底退休 ,是因为州长的 一  项提案 — 将六所综合性大学从 校 委 会 系 统 剥 离 ,并创立各自独立的理事会(would retire. . .  because of the governor,s proposal to split off. . . and create. . . . . . ) ; ③句继而明确其观点 : 改组计划行不通  (called the reorganization “unworkable”) 。
　　　[排除干扰] A项由第八段 ①句“Morgan一个 月内两次公开反对州长提案 ”过度推断出 “他对田纳 西州政府失去了信心 ”。B项将第八 段 ①句 “反对两项高等教育计划 ”夸大为 “反对所有的高等教育政 策 ”。C项“反对外包提案 ”虽为首五段所述事实 ,但由 mark the second time. . . 、said last week 可知 , Morgan提出辞职是一周前 ,而“反对外包 ”是新近事件 ,为其第二次反对州长教育计划 。
　　　[提炼思路] 本题考查“文中人物某行为的原因 ”,解题可 :一 、抓取因果关系词 ,第八段 ②句 because of后即为“辞职原因 — 学院理事会系统重组(splitoff. . . and create. . . ) ”,二 ,再联系上下文 , 明确人物   观点态度,①句和 ③句均体现摩根对 “学院理事会系统重组计划 ”的反对态度 ( come out against、 unworkable) , 由此确定答案为 D) 。

　　　第一段引入话 题 : 16 世 纪 末兴起于欧洲的贵族子弟环欧旅行 — 壮游 o  Beginning in . . . 、Thus   was born. . .  GrandTour, a practice. . . 、Travelwas. . . 串起三句间 “事物缘起 → 概说影响 → 补充评价 ” 的语义线索 。
　　　①句 介 绍 “壮 游 ”的 缘 起 o  Beginning in the late sixteenth century、(for)   young aristocrats、to visit. . . 、(as) the culmination of their classicaleducation分别明确时间 、人物 、事件(新潮流) 、事件成因 。 above all(“最重要的 ,尤其 ”) 强调罗马在旅行中的重要性 ,其原因也由旅行目的彰显 :游览巴黎 、威尼斯   等地意在“行万里路 ,追根溯源 ”, 由 此 来 真 正 领悟书中所学的古典文化(culmination既是 “终点 ”, 也是   “顶点 ”) ,那么作为古罗马文明发祥地的罗马自然占据特别重要的地位 。
　　　注 :classicaleducation(古典教育) 指对 “三艺四术 ”(拉丁和希腊语 语 法 、逻辑 、修辞 、算术 、几何 、天   文 、音乐等) 的学习 ,包括但不限于在大学接受的教育(如英国该时期已有文法学校教授小孩拉丁语法) 。
　　　②句介绍“壮游 ”的价值:法国和意大利的文化艺术得以广泛传播 o  Thus承上引出人们熟悉的概  念 , 明确全篇话题 。 同位语 a practicewhich. . . 对首句潮流的意义展开介绍 ;introduced. . . to the artand culture(introduce指“使某人初次接触到 某 事 ”) 明确两层意义 : 让贵族子弟亲身体验古典文化 , 又让古  典文化传播开来 。Englishmen. . .  and also Americans与 for the next300 years从地域(跨越欧美) 和时  间(直到 20世纪) 两方面凸显“壮游 ”的广泛影响力 。
　　　③句补充评价“壮游 ”的“奢侈 ”属性 :20世纪之前专属贵族阶层 o  arduous and costly表明壮游的特 点 ;possible onlyfor. . . (possible指“能做得到的 、可实现的 ”) 为分隔的后置定语 ,修饰 Travel,实际表示 旅行特点带来的后果:如此艰难而又奢侈 ,也 只 有 特 权 阶 层才承受得起 , 与首句人物 aristocrats(贵族) 呼应 。破折号后借助“名词  (thesame 回指 aprivileged class) 十 定语从句 ”的形式对该特权阶层的价值 进行补充说明 :孕育了许多专家 ,既涉及艺术 ,还涉及科学 、文学领域 。
　　　注 :gentleman scientist( 绅士科学家) 源自后文艺复兴时期的欧 洲 , 指财务上独立 , 以从事科学研 究为个人爱好的自费科学家 。 维 多利亚时代起 , 政府和私人开始对科学研究大量资助 , 该称谓逐 渐淡出 。

51.  whatissaid abouttheGrandTour?	51.  关于“壮游 ”,文章谈及了什么?
A) Itwas fashionable among young people of the time.	A) 它在当时的年轻人当中很流行 。
B) Itwas unaffordable forordinary people.	B) 它对于普通人而言负担不起 。
C) Itproduced some famous European artists.	C) 它造就了不少欧洲著名艺术家 。
D) Itmade a compulsory partofcollege education.	D) 它是大学教育中一个必需环节 。
　　　[精准定 位] 题干关键词  Grand Tour首现于第 一 段 ②句 , 但  Thus was born the idea. . . 及 ③句 Travelwas. . . 提示前后文均是对它的介绍 ;而第二题关键词与第二段段首 GrandTourists契合 ,故解题 锁定首段 。
　　　[锁定答案] B) o  ③句中形容词短语 possibleonlyfor a privileged class(只有特权阶级才可能实现 、 做得到) 实际修饰主语 Travel(即 GrandTour) ,言外之意即 : (旅途劳顿与开销) 非普通百姓所能承受 。

　　　[排除干扰] A项扩大了群体范畴 :把 ①句 “年轻贵族(young aristocrats) ”偷换为 “年轻人(young people) ”。C项利用 ③句末 patrons ofthe arts干扰 ,但首先 “艺术赞助人 ”≠ “艺术家 ”,其次科学家 、作  家等产自 特 权 阶 层 , 而 非 直 接 产  自  Grand Tour。 D 项 复 现 ① 句 关 键 词  education, 但 “成 为 时 尚  (fashionable) ”≠ “是 必 需 的 环 节 (compulsory) ”, 再 者 “古 典 教 育 (classical) ”未 必 限 于 “大 学 教 育  (college) ”。
[提炼思路] GrandTour相关信息散布于全段 ,可先从选项入手 ,提炼各项核心点(性质 、作用 、概念
等) :A)fashionable;B)unaffordable;C)produced artists;D)compulsory。 随后逐一比对原文 ,发现 A项和 C项是用原词或形近词设陷 ,但在“状语 ”和“宾语 ”上做手脚 ,D项没有直接的对应词 ,提炼度也高 ,很有 正确项特点,但却在核心处偷 换 了 概 念 。B项 unaffordable虽与文中 possible相反 ,但所涉对 象 也 恰 与 文中相对 ,实现了原文的“同义复述 ”。

52.  whatdidGrandTouristshavein common?	52.  壮游客有什么共同之处?
A) Theyhad much geographic knowledge.	A) 他们有着丰富的地理知识 。
B) They were courageous and venturesome.	B) 他们勇敢而富有冒险精神 。
C) They were versedin literature and interested in art.	C) 他们既精通文学又喜爱艺术 。
D) Theyhad enough travel and outdoor-life experience.	D) 他们有充足的旅行和户外生活经验 。


　　　[精准定位] 由题干关键词 GrandTourists和 in common可定位至第二段 ①句(The GrandTourist was typically. . . ) 。
　　　[锁定答案] C) 。第二段 ①句指出 ,壮游客通常是 “有着 扎实的希腊和拉丁文学基础 ,有空闲时间 、 有些钱 ,对艺术也有兴趣的年轻人 ”。可见他们的共同点在于:文学底子好 、时间与金钱宽裕 、喜爱艺   术 。C项是对其中两点 a thorough grounding in. . . literature、some interestin art的同义复述 ,be versed in表示“精通于 ”。
　　　[ 排除干扰] A项由第二 、三段中的多处地名 以及壮游客四处游历的情形编造出 “他们深谙地理知 识 ”。B项源于第三段 ①句“极少数冒险者……(a veryfew adventurers) ”,但好冒险的仅为少数人 ,并非 共性 。D项与第 二 段 ③句中 “多数人由老师或看护人陪同(accompanied by. . . or guardian) ”所暗含的 “他们涉世不深 ,欠缺远游经历 ”矛盾 。
　　　[ 提炼思路] 与上题类似 ,题干所涉范围很大 ,先提炼选项关键信息 :A) 是地理达人;B) 勇敢 、爱冒   险 ;C) 文学功底好 、爱艺术 ;D) 旅行 、户外生活的 达 人 。 不难发现 A、B、D 三项均立足于单纯的 “长途旅   行 ”,而开篇已知“壮游 ”背后的意旨在于丰富“古典教育 ”,第二 、三段也围绕 “壮游客们在文化艺术方面   (雕塑 、绘画 、建筑等等) 的所见所得 ”展开 , 初步判断 C 项可能正确 , 再通过仔细比对原文锁定答案 。 注 :本题选项均是大力赞赏性内容 , 因此可直接锁定第二段 ①句 , 而略过 ②句(个例) 和 ③句(虽聚焦多   数人 ,但体现一定的局限性 ,总体为中性内容) 。

53.  How didGrandTouristsbenefitfrom theirtravel?	53.  壮游客是如何从他们的旅行中获益的?
　A)  They found inspiration in the world,s greatest masterpieces.	　A)  他 们 从 世 间 最 伟 大 的 杰 作 中 获 得 了 灵感 。
B)  They got a better understanding of early human civilization.	B) 他们获得了对人类早期文 明 更 透 彻 的 理解 。
C) They developed an interestin the origin ofmodern artforms.	　C)  他 们 对 现 代 艺 术 形 式 的 起 源 产 生 了 兴趣 。
D)  They gained some knowledge of classical art and architecture.	D)  他 们 对 古 典 艺 术 及 建 筑 获 得 了 一 定 知识 。
　　　[精准定位]  可由  Grand Tourists和  benefit from 定位至第二段 ③句 ( Most Grand Tourists. . . expected to. . . ) 。
　　　[锁定答案] D) 。第二段 ③句指出 ,大多数壮游客并没有太大的学术抱负 ,旅途只作短暂停留 ,预计   会带着旅行中对艺术及建筑的了解 返 程 。 即 :他 们 将从旅行中收获 一 些有关古典艺术及建筑的知识 。 D项是对原文 an understanding of artand architecture的同义改写 。
　　　[ 排除干扰] A项干扰源于第二段 ③句中 greatmasterpieces以及文章末尾的具体例子“英格兰贵族 从国外伟大作品或遗迹中吸取经验 ,用于自身建筑 ”,但  “世间最伟大的作品 ”漏洞有二 :一 、范围过大 : 原文为“他们主要从艺术 、建筑作品中获益 ”;二 、选项为“最高级形式(greatest) ”,过于绝对 。 另外 , “(文 末) 为我所用 ”≠“获得灵 感 ”。B 项复现 ③句中的 understanding,但将理解的对象 “艺术 、建筑 ”偷换成 “人类早期文明 ”。C项干扰源自第二段 ②句 arthistory,但该句聚焦 “在希腊罗马雕 塑 艺 术 上 的 收 获 ”, 不涉及“现代艺术形式的源头 ”相关内容 。
　　　[ 提炼思路] 本题表面上考查“壮游客获益的方式(How) ”,而由选项可知 ,本题实质考查 “他们具体  收获的内 容 ”, 因此解题关键是寻找与  benefit相关的同义/近义表达 。 第二段 ③句  returned home

with. . . (把…… 带回家) 直接与 “旅行获益 ”相关 , 且适用于多数人 , 初步推测  D 项正确 。 另外 , ②句 pioneered. . .  with his. . . (凭着…… 成为先驱) 虽聚焦个例,也能 一 定程度体现 “旅行收获 ”, 而 “希腊罗 马雕塑艺术 ”明显属于“古典艺术 ”,故确定 D项正确 。

B)  Europe hardly had any museums before the19th century.	B)  欧 洲 在  19 世 纪 之 前 几 乎 没 有 什 么 博 物馆 。
C) Theyfound the antiques there more valuable.	C) 他们发现那里的古物价值更高 。
D) private collections were ofgreatervariety.	D) 私人藏品的种类更加丰富 。
　　　[精准 定 位] 根据题干关键词  Grand Tourists、the private collections定位至第三段 ⑥句 ( Grand Tourists. . .  private collections) 。
　　　[锁定答案] B) o  ⑥句指出,由于欧洲在十八世纪末之 前 几 乎 没 有 博 物 馆,壮游客要想观赏画作和  雕塑 ,往往要获得“参观私人收藏 ”的入场券 。B) 是对原文 there were few museums anywhere in Europe before the close of the eighteenth century的同义改写 。
　　　[ 排除干扰] A项把第二段末“多数人会带着旅行纪念品返乡 (with souvenirs of their travels) ”与第   三段 ⑥句“渴望获得收藏品(eager to acquire examples of. . . ) ”糅杂编造出“能从私人收藏中买到独一无   二的纪念品 ”。C项从壮游客对藏品的渴望主观臆断出私人藏品“价值更高 ”,但原文并未提及 。 D项利   用 ③句 collections ofallkindsofhistoricalrelics干扰 ,但这是对意大利的描述 ,而非对私人收藏的描述 。
　　　[提炼思路] 由题干关键词 why确认本题考查因果逻辑中的 “因 ”,解题时可 : 一 、回文寻找题干已 知的“果 ”(第三段 ⑥句 . . . gaining admission to private collections) ;二 、在定位处搜寻表示因果逻辑的关

　　After becoming president of Purdue University in 2013, Mitch Daniels asked the faculty to prove that their students have actually achieved one of higher education's most important goals: critical thinking skills. Two years before, a nationwide study of college graduates had shown that more than a third had made no __26__ gains in such mental abilities during their school years. Mr. Daniels needed to __27__ the high cost of attending Purdue to its students and their families. After all, the percentage of Americans who say a college degree is "very important" has fallen __28__ in the last 5-6 years.
　　Purdue now has a pilot test to assess students' critical thinking skills. Yet like many college teachers around the U.S., the faculty remain __29__ that their work as educators can be measured by a "learning __30__" such as a graduate's ability to investigate and reason. However, the professors need not worry so much. The results of a recent experiment showed that professors can use __31__ metrics to measure how well students do in three key areas: critical thinking, written communication, and quantitative literacy.
　　Despite the success of the experiment, the actual results are worrisome, and mostly __32__ earlier studies. The organizers of the experiment concluded that far fewer students were achieving at high levels on critical thinking than they were doing for written communication or quantitative literacy. And that conclusion is based only on students nearing graduation.
　　American universities, despite their global __33__ for excellence in teaching, have only begun to demonstrate what they can produce in real-world learning. Knowledge-based degrees are still important, but employers are __34__ advanced thinking skills from college graduates. If the intellectual worth of a college degree can be __35__ measured, more people will seek higher education—and come out better thinkers.

B) confirm 
C) demanding 
D) doubtful 
E) drastically 
F) justify 
G) monopolized 
H) outcome 
I) predominance 
J) presuming 
K) reputation 
L) significant 
M) signify 
N) simultaneously 
O) standardized


Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2.

The Price of Oil and the Price of Carbon

A) Fossil fuel prices are likely to stay "low for long". Notwithstanding important recent progress in developing renewable fuel sources, low fossil fuel prices could discourage further innovation in, and adoption of, cleaner energy technologies. The result would be higher emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

B) Policymakers should not allow low energy prices to derail the clean energy transition. Action to restore appropriate price incentives, notably through corrective carbon pricing, is urgently needed to lower the risk of irreversible and potentially devastating effects of climate change. That approach also offers fiscal benefits.

C) Oil prices have dropped by over 60% since June 2014. A commonly held view in the oil industry is that "the best cure for low oil prices is low oil prices". The reasoning behind this saying is that low oil prices discourage investment in new production capacity, eventually shifting the oil supply curve backward and bringing prices back up as existing oil fields—which can be tapped at relatively low marginal cost—are depleted. In fact, in line with past experience, capital expenditure in the oil sector has dropped sharply in many producing countries, including the United States. The dynamic adjustment to low oil prices may, however, be different this time around.

D) Oil prices are expected to remain lower for longer. The advent of new technologies has added about 4.2 million barrels per day to the crude oil market, contributing to a global over-supply. In addition, other factors are putting downward pressure on oil prices: change in the strategic behavior of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the projected increase in Iranian exports, the scaling-down of global demand (especially from emerging markets), the long-term drop in petroleum consumption in the United States, and some displacement of oil by substitutes. These likely persistent forces, like the growth of shale (页岩) oil, point to a "low for long" scenario. Futures markets, which show only a modest recovery of prices to around $60 a barrel by 2019, support this view.

E) Natural gas and coal—also fossil fuels—have similarly seen price declines that look to be long-lived. Coal and natural gas are mainly used for electricity generation, whereas oil is used mostly to power transportation, yet the prices of all these energy sources are linked. The North American shale gas boom has resulted in record low prices there. The recent discovery of the giant Zohr gas field off the Egyptian coast will eventually have impact on pricing in the Mediterranean region and Europe, and there is significant development potential in many other places, notably Argentina. Coal prices also are low, owing to over-supply and the scaling-down of demand, especially from China, which bums half of the world's coal.

F) Technological innovations have unleashed the power of renewables such as wind, hydro, solar, and geothermal (地热). Even Africa and the Middle East, home to economies that are heavily dependent on fossil fuel exports, have enormous potential to develop renewables. For example, the United Arab Emirates has endorsed an ambitious target to draw 24% of its primary energy consumption from renewable sources by 2021.

G) Progress in the development of renewables could be fragile, however, if fossil fuel prices remain low for long. Renewables account for only a small share of global primary energy consumption, which is still dominated by fossil fuels—30% each for coal and oil, 25% for natural gas. But renewable energy will have to displace fossil fuels to a much greater extent in the future to avoid unacceptable climate risks.

H) Unfortunately, the current low prices for oil, gas, and coal may provide little incentive for research to find even cheaper substitutes for those fuels. There is strong evidence that both innovation and adoption of cleaner technology are strongly encouraged by higher fossil fuel prices. The same is true for new technologies for alleviating fossil fuel emissions.

I) The current low fossil fuel price environment will thus certainly delay the energy transition from fossil fuel to clean energy sources. Unless renewables become cheap enough that substantial carbon deposits are left underground for a very long time, if not forever, the planet will likely be exposed to potentially catastrophic climate risks.

J) Some climate impacts may already be discernible. For example, the United Nations Children's Fund estimates that some 11 million children in Africa face hunger, disease, and water shortages as a result of the strongest El Nino (厄尔尼诺) weather phenomenon in decades. Many scientists believe that El Nino events, caused by warming in the Pacific, are becoming more intense as a result of climate change.

K) Nations from around the world have gathered in Paris for the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP 21, with the goal of a universal and potentially legally-binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We need very broad participation to fully address the global tragedy that results when countries fail to take into account the negative impact of their carbon emissions on the rest of the world. Moreover, non-participation by nations, if sufficiently widespread, can undermine the political will of participating countries to act.

L) The nations participating at COP 21 are focusing on quantitative emissions-reduction commitments. Economic reasoning shows that the least expensive way for each country is to put a price on carbon emissions. The reason is that when carbon is priced, those emissions reductions that are least costly to implement will happen first. The International Monetary Fund calculates that countries can generate substantial fiscal revenues by eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and levying carbon charges that capture the domestic damage caused by emissions. A tax on upstream carbon sources is one easy way to put a price on carbon emissions, although some countries may wish to use other methods, such as emissions trading schemes. In order to maximize global welfare, every country's carbon pricing should reflect not only the purely domestic damage from emissions, but also the damage to foreign countries.

M) Setting the right carbon price will therefore efficiently align the costs paid by carbon users with the true social opportunity cost of using carbon. By raising relative demand for clean energy sources, a carbon price would also help align the market return to clean-energy innovation with its social return, spurring the refinement of existing technologies and the development of new ones. And it would raise the demand for technologies such as carbon capture and storage, spurring their further development. If not corrected by the appropriate carbon price, low fossil fuel prices are not accurately signaling to markets the true social profitability of clean energy. While alternative estimates of the damage from carbon emissions differ, and it's especially hard to reckon the likely costs of possible catastrophic climate events, most estimates suggest substantial negative effects.

N) Direct subsidies to research and development have been adopted by some governments but are a poor substitute for a carbon price: they do only part of the job, leaving in place market incentives to over-use fossil fuels and thereby add to the stock of atmospheric greenhouse gases without regard to the collateral (附带的) costs.

O) The hope is that the success of COP 21 opens the door to future international agreement on carbon prices. Agreement on an international carbon-price floor would be a good starting point in that process. Failure to address comprehensively the problem of greenhouse gas emissions, however, exposes all generations, present and future, to incalculable risks.

36. A number of factors are driving down the global oil prices not just for now but in the foreseeable future.

37. Pricing carbon proves the most economical way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

38. It is estimated that extreme weather conditions have endangered the lives of millions of African children.

39. The prices of coal are low as a result of over-supply and decreasing demand.

40. Higher fossil fuel prices prove to be conducive to innovation and application of cleaner technology.

41. If fossil fuel prices remain low for a long time, it may lead to higher emissions of greenhouse gases.

42. Fossil fuels remain the major source of primary energy consumption in today's world.

43. Even major fossil exporting countries have great potential to develop renewable energies.

44. Greenhouse gas emissions, if not properly dealt with, will pose endless risks for mankind.

45. It is urgent for governments to increase the cost of using fossil fuels to an appropriate level to lessen the catastrophic effects of climate change.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　Open data sharers are still in the minority in many fields. Although many researchers broadly agree that public access to raw data would accelerate science, most are reluctant to post the results of their own labors online.
　　Some communities have agreed to share online—geneticists, for example, post DNA sequences at the GenBank repository (库) , and astronomers are accustomed to accessing images of galaxies and stars from, say, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a telescope that has observed some 500 million objects—but these remain the exception, not the rule. Historically, scientists have objected to sharing for many reasons: it is a lot of work; until recently, good databases did not exist; grant funders were not pushing for sharing; it has been difficult to agree on standards for formatting data; and there is no agreed way to assign credit for data.
　　But the barriers are disappearing, in part because journals and funding agencies worldwide are encouraging scientists to make their data public. Last year, the Royal Society in London said in its report that scientists need to "shift away from a research culture where data is viewed as a private preserve". Funding agencies note that data paid for with public money should be public information, and the scientific community is recognizing that data can now be shared digitally in ways that were not possible before. To match the growing demand, services are springing up to make it easier to publish research products online and enable other researchers to discover and cite them.
　　Although calls to share data often concentrate on the moral advantages of sharing, the practice is not purely altruistic (利他的). Researchers who share get plenty of personal benefits, including more connections with colleagues, improved visibility and increased citations. The most successful sharers—those whose data are downloaded and cited the most often---get noticed, and their work gets used. For example, one of the most popular data sets on multidisciplinary repository Dryad is about wood density around the world; it has been downloaded 5,700 times. Co-author Amy Zanne thinks that users probably range from climate-change researchers wanting to estimate how much carbon is stored in biomass, to foresters looking for information on different grades of timber. "I'd much prefer to have my data used by the maximum number of people to ask their own questions," she says. "It's important to allow readers and reviewers to see exactly how you arrive at your results. Publishing data and code allows your science to be reproducible."
　　Even people whose data are less popular can benefit. By making the effort to organize and label files so others can understand them, scientists become more organized and better disciplined themselves, thus avoiding confusion later on.

46. What do many researchers generally accept?
A) It is imperative to protect scientists' patents.
B) Repositories are essential to scientific research.
C) Open data sharing is most important to medical science.
D) Open data sharing is conducive to scientific advancement.

47. What is the attitude of most researchers towards making their own data public?
A) Opposed.
B) Ambiguous.
C) Liberal.
D) Neutral.

48. According to the passage, what might hinder open data sharing?
A) The fear of massive copying.
B) The lack of a research culture.
C) The belief that research data is private intellectual property.
D) The concern that certain agencies may make a profit out of it.

49. What helps lift some of the barriers to open data sharing?
A) The ever-growing demand for big data.
B) The advancement of digital technology.
C) The changing attitude of journals and funders.
D) The trend of social and economic development.

50. Dryad serves as an example to show how open data sharing ________.
A) is becoming increasingly popular
B) benefits sharers and users alike
C) makes researchers successful
D) saves both money and labor

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Macy's reported its sales plunged 5.2% in November and December at stores open more than a year, a disappointing holiday season performance that capped a difficult year for a department store chain facing wide-ranging challenges. Its flagship stores in major U.S. cities depend heavily on international tourist spending, which shrank at many retailers due to a strong dollar. Meanwhile, Macy's has simply struggled to lure consumers who are more interested in spending on travel or dining out than on new clothes or accessories.
　　The company blamed much of the poor performance in November and December on unseasonably warm weather. "About 80% of our company's year-over-year declines in comparable sales can be attributed to shortfalls (短缺) in cold-weather goods," said chief executive Teny Lundgren in a press release. This prompted the company to cut its forecasts for the full fourth quarter.
　　However, it's clear that Macy's believes its troubles run deeper than a temporary aberration (偏离) off the thermometer. The retail giant said the poor financial performance this year has pushed it to begin implementing $400 million in cost-cutting measures. The company pledged to cut 600 back-office positions, though some 150 workers in those roles would be reassigned to other jobs. It also plans to offer "voluntary separation" packages to 165 senior executives. It will slash staffing at its fleet of 770 stores, a move affecting some 3,000 employees.
　　The retailer also announced the locations of 36 stores it will close in early 2016. The company had previously announced the planned closures, but had not said which locations would be affected. None of the chain's stores in the Washington metropolitan area are to be closed.
　　Macy's has been moving aggressively to try to remake itself for a new era of shopping. It has plans to open more locations of Macy's Backstage, a newly-developed off-price concept which might help it better compete with ambitious T. J. Maxx. It's also pushing ahead in 2016 with an expansion of Bluemercury, the beauty chain it bought last year. At a time when young beauty shoppers are often turning to Sephora or Ulta instead of department store beauty counters, Macy's hopes Bluemercury will help strengthen its position in the category.
　　One relative bright spot for Macy's during the holiday season was the online channel, where it rang up "double-digit" increases in sales and a 25% increase in the number of orders it filled. That relative strength would be consistent with what was seen in the wilder retail industry during the early part of the holiday season. While Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday all saw record spending online, in-store sales plunged over the holiday weekend.

Part III                Reading Comprehension            (40 minutes)

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

　　Half of your brain stays alert and prepared for danger when you sleep in a new place, a study has revealed. This phenomenon is often __26__ to as the "first-night-effect". Researchers from Brown University found that a network in the left hemisphere of the brain "remained more active" than the network in the right side of the brain. Playing sounds into the right ears (stimulating the left hemisphere) of __27__ was more likely to wake them up than if the noises were played into their left ear.
　　It was __28__ observed that the left side of the brain was more active during deep sleep. When the researchers repeated the laboratory experiment on the second and third nights they found the left hemisphere could not be stimulated in the same way during deep sleep. The researchers explained that the study demonstrated when we are in a __29__ environment the brain partly remains alert so that humans can defend themselves against any __30__ danger.
　　The researchers believe this is the first time that the "first-night-effect" of different brain states has been __31__ in humans. It isn't, however, the first time it has ever been seen. Some animal __32__ also display this phenomenon. For example, dolphins, as well as other __33__ animals, shut down one hemisphere of the brain when they go to sleep. A previous study noted that dolphins always __34__ control their breathing. Without keeping the brain active while sleeping, they would probably drown. But, as the human study suggest, another reason for dolphins keeping their eyes open during sleep is that they can look out for __35__ while asleep. It also keeps their physiological processes working.


A) classified 
B) consciously 
C) dramatically 
D) exotic 
E) identified 
F) inherent 
G) marine 
H) novel
I) potential 
J) predators

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Elite Math Competitions Struggle to Diversify Their Talent Pool

A) Interest in elite high school math competitions has grown in recent years, and in light of last summer's U.S. win at the International Math Olympiad (IMO)—the first for an American team in more than two decades—the trend is likely to continue.

B) But will such contests, which are overwhelmingly dominated by Asian and white students from middle-class and affluent families, become any more diverse? Many social and cultural factors play roles in determining which promising students get on the path toward international math recognition. But efforts are in place to expose more black, Hispanic, and low-income students to advanced math, in the hope that the demographic pool of high-level contenders will eventually begin to shift and become less exclusive.

C) "The challenge is if certain types of people are doing something, it's difficult for other people to break into it," said Po-Shen Loh, the head coach of last year's winning U.S. Math Olympiad team. Participation grows through friends and networks and if "you realize that's how they're growing, you can start to take action" and bring in other students, he said.

D) Most of the training for advanced-math competitions happens outside the confines of the normal school day. Students attend after-school clubs, summer camps, online forums and classes, and university-based "math circles", to prepare for the competitions.

E) One of the largest feeders for high school math competitions—including those that eventually lead to the IMO—is a middle school program called Math Counts. About 100,000 students around the country participate in the program's competition series, which culminates in a national game-show-style contest held each May. The most recent one took place last week in Washington, D.C. Students join a team through their schools, which provide a volunteer coach and pay a nominal fee to send students to regional and state competitions. The 224 students who make it to the national competition get an all-expenses- paid trip.

F) Nearly all members of last year's winning U.S. IMO team took part in Math Counts as middle school students, as did Loh, the coach. "Middle school is an important age because students have enough math capability to solve advanced problems, but they haven't really decided what they want to do with their lives," said Loh. "They often get hooked then."

G) Another influential feeder for advanced-math students is an online school called Art of Problem Solving, which began about 13 years ago and now has 15,000 users. Students use forums to chat, play games, and solve problems together at no cost, or they can pay a few hundred dollars to take courses with trained teachers. According to Richard Rusczyk, the company founder, the six U.S. team members who competed at the IMO last year collectively took more than 40 courses on the site. Parents of advanced- math students and Math Counts coaches say the children are on the website constantly.

H) There are also dozens of summer camps—many attached to universities—that aim to prepare elite math students. Some are pricey---a three-week intensive program can cost $4,500 or more—but most offer scholarships. The Math Olympiad Summer Training Program is a three-week math camp held by the Mathematical Association of America that leads straight to the international championship and is free for those who make it. Only about 50 students are invited based on their performance on written tests and at the USA Math Olympiad.

I) Students in university towns may also have access to another lever for involvement in accelerated math: math circles. In these groups, which came out of an Eastern European tradition of developing young talent, professors teach promising K-12 students advanced mathematics for several hours after school or on weekends. The Los Angeles Math Circle, held at the University of California, Los Angeles, began in 2007 with 20 students and now has more than 250. "These math circles cost nothing, or they're very cheap for students to get involved in, but you have to know about them," said Rusczyk. "Most people would love to get students from more underserved populations, but they just can't get them in the door. Part of it is communication; part of it is transportation."

J) It's no secret in the advanced-math community that diversity is a problem. According to Mark Saul, the director of competitions for the Mathematical Association of America, not a single African-American or Hispanic student—and only a handful of girls—has ever made it to the Math Olympiad team in its 50 years of existence. Many schools simply don't prioritize academic competitions. "Do you know who we have to beat?" asked Saul. "The football team, the basketball team—that's our competition for resources, student time, attention, school dollars, parent efforts, school enthusiasm."

K) Teachers in low-income urban and rural areas with no history of participating in math competitions may not know about advanced-math opportunities like Math Counts—and those who do may not have support or feel trained to lead them.

L) But there are initiatives in place to try to get more underrepresented students involved in accelerated math. A New York City-based nonprofit called Bridge to Enter Mathematics runs a residential summer program aimed at getting underserved students，mostly black and Hispanic, working toward math and science careers. The summer after 7th grade, students spend three weeks on a college campus studying advanced math for seven hours a day. Over the next five years, the group helps the students get into other elite summer math programs, high-performing high schools, and eventually college. About 250 students so far have gone through the program, which receives funding from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation.

M) "If you look at a lot of low-income communities in the United States, there are programs that are serving them, but they' re primarily centered around 'Let's get these kids' grades up', and not around 'Let's get these kids access to the same kinds of opportunities as more-affluent kids,'" said Daniel Zaharopol, the founder and executive director of the program. "We're trying to create that pathway." Students apply to the program directly through their schools. "We want to reach parents who are not plugged into the system," said Zaharopol.

N) In the past few years, Math Counts added two new middle school programs to try to diversify its participant pool---the National Math Club and the Math Video Challenge. Schools or teachers who sign up for the National Math Club receive a kit full of activities and resources, but there's no special teacher training and no competition attached.

O) The Math Video Challenge is a competition, but a collaborative one. Teams of four students make a video illustrating a math problem and its real-world application. After the high-pressure Countdown round at this year's national Math Counts competition, in which the top 12 students went head to head solving complex problems in rapid fire, the finalists for the Math Video Challenge took the stage to show their videos. The demographics of that group looked quite different from those in the competition round—of the 16 video finalists, 13 were girls and eight were African-American students. The video challenge does not put individual students on the hot seat—so it's less intimidating by design. It also adds the element of artistic creativity to attract a new pool of students who may not see themselves as "math people".

36. Middle school is a crucial period when students may become keenly interested in advanced mathematics.

37. Elite high school math competitions are attracting more interest throughout the United States.

38. Math circles provide students with access to advanced-math training by university professors.

39. Students may take advantage of online resources to learn to solve math problems.

40. The summer program run by a nonprofit organization has helped many underserved students learn advanced math.

41. Winners of local contests will participate in the national math competition for free.

42. Many schools don't place academic competitions at the top of their priority list.

43. Contestants of elite high school math competitions are mostly Asian and white students from well-off families.

44. Some math training programs primarily focus on raising students' math scores.

45. Some intensive summer programs are very expensive but most of them provide scholarships.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　We live today indebted to McCardell, Cashin, Hawes, Wilkins, and Maxwell, and other women who liberated American fashion from the confines of Parisian design. Independence came in tying, wrapping, storing, harmonizing, and rationalizing that wardrobe. These designers established the modem dress code, letting playsuits and other active wear outfits suffice for casual clothing, allowing pants to enter the wardrobe, and prizing rationalism and versatility in dress, in contradiction to dressing for an occasion or allotment of the day. Fashion in America was logical and answerable to the will of the women who wore it. Implicitly or explicitly, American fashion addressed a democracy, whereas traditional Paris-based fashion was prescriptive and imposed on women, willing or not.
　　In an earlier time, American fashion had also followed the dictates of Paris, or even copied and pirated specific French designs. Designer sportswear was not modeled on that of Europe, as "modem art" would later be; it was genuinely invented and developed in America. Its designers were not high-end with supplementary lines. The design objective and the business commitment were to sportswear, and the distinctive traits were problem-solving ingenuity and realistic lifestyle applications. Ease of care was most important: summer dresses and outfits, in particular, were chiefly cotton, readily capable of being washed and pressed at home. Closings were simple, practical, and accessible, as the modem woman depended on no personal maid to dress her. American designers prized resourcefulness and the freedom of women who wore the clothing.
　　Many have argued that the women designers of this time were able to project their own clothing values into a new style. Of course, much of this argument in the 1930s-40s was advanced because there was little or no experience in justifying apparel (服装) on the basis of utility. If Paris was cast aside, the tradition of beauty was also to some degree slighted. Designer sportswear would have to be verified by a standard other than that of pure beauty; the emulation of a designer's life in designer sportswear was a crude version of this relationship. The consumer was ultimately to be mentioned as well, especially by the likes of Dorothy Shaver, who could point to the sales figures at Lord &amp; Taylor.
　　Could utility alone justify the new ideas of the American designers? Fashion is often regarded as a pursuit of beauty, and some cherished fashion's trivial relationship to the fine arts. What the designers of the American sportswear proved was that fashion is a genuine design art, answering to the demanding needs of service. Of course these practical, insightful designers have determined the course of late twentieth-century fashion. They were the pioneers of gender equity, in their useful, adaptable clothing, which was both made for the masses and capable of self-expression.

46. What contribution did the women designers make to American fashion?
A) They made some improvements on the traditional Parisian design.
B) They formulated a dress code with distinctive American features.
C) They came up with a brand new set of design procedures.
D) They made originality a top priority in their fashion design.

47. What do we learn about American designer sportswear?
A) It imitated the European model.
B) It laid emphasis on women's beauty.
C) It represented genuine American art.
D) It was a completely new invention.

48. What characterized American designer sportswear?
A) Pursuit of beauty.
B) Decorative closings.
C) Ease of care.
D) Fabric quality.

49. What occurred in the design of women's apparel in America during the 1930s-40s?
A) A shift of emphasis from beauty to utility.
B) The emulation of traditional Parisian design.
C) A search for balance between tradition and novelty.
D) The involvement of more women in fashion design.

50. What do we learn about designers of American sportswear?
A) They catered to the taste of the younger generation.
B) They radically changed people's concept of beauty.
C) They advocated equity between men and women.
D) They became rivals of their Parisian counterparts.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Massive rubbish dumps and sprawling landfills constitute one of the more uncomfortable impacts that humans have on wildlife. They have led some birds to give up on migration. Instead of flying thousands of miles in search of food, they make the waste sites their winter feeding grounds.
　　Researchers in Germany used miniature GPS tags to track the migrations of 70 white storks (鹳) from different sites across Europe and Asia during the first five months of their lives. While many birds travelled along well-known routes to warmer climates, others stopped short and spent the winter on landfills, feeding on food waste, and the multitudes of insects that thrive on the dumps.
　　In the short-term, the birds seem to benefit from overwintering (过冬) on rubbish dumps. Andrea Flack of the Max Planck Institute found that birds following traditional migration routes were more likely to die than German storks that flew only as far as northern Morocco, and spent the winter there on rubbish dumps. "For the birds it's a very convenient way to get food. There are huge clusters of organic waste they can feed on," said Flack. The meals are not particularly appetising, or even safe. Much of the waste is discarded rotten meat, mixed in with other human debris such as plastic bags and old toys.
　　"It's very risky. The birds can easily eat pieces of plastic or rubber bands and they can die," said Flack. "And we don't know about the long-term consequences. They might eat something toxic and damage their health. We cannot estimate that yet."
　　The scientists tracked white storks from different colonies in Europe and Africa. The Russian, Greek and Polish storks flew as far as South Africa, while those from Spain, Tunisia and Germany flew only as far as the Sahel.
　　Landfill sites on the Iberian peninsula have long attracted local white storks, but all of the Spanish birds tagged in the study flew across the Sahara desert to the western Sahel. Writing in the journal, the scientists describe how the storks from Germany were clearly affected by the presence of waste sites, with four out of six birds that survived for at least five months overwintering on rubbish dumps in northern Morocco, instead of migrating to the Sahel.
　　Flack said it was too early to know whether the benefits of plentiful food outweighed the risks of feeding on landfills. But that's not the only uncertainty. Migrating birds affect ecosystems both at home and at their winter destinations, and disrupting the traditional routes could have unexpected side effects. White storks feed on locusts (蝗虫) and other insects that can become pests if their numbers get out of hand. "They provide a useful service," said Flack.

51. What is the impact of rubbish dumps on wildlife?
A) They have forced white storks to search for safer winter shelters.
B) They have seriously polluted the places where birds spend winter.
C) They have accelerated the reproduction of some harmful insects.
D) They have changed the previous migration habits of certain birds.

52. What do we learn about birds following the traditional migration routes?
A) They can multiply at an accelerating rate.
B) They can better pull through the winter.
C) They help humans kill harmful insects.
D) They are more likely to be at risk of dying.

53. What does Andrea Flack say about the birds overwintering on rubbish dumps?
A) They may end up staying there permanently.
B) They may eat something harmful.
C) They may evolve new feeding habits.
D) They may have trouble getting adequate food.

54. What can be inferred about the Spanish birds tagged in the study?
A) They gradually lose the habit of migrating in winter.
B) They prefer rubbish dumps far away to those at home.
C) They are not attracted to the rubbish dumps on their migration routes.
D) They join the storks from Germany on rubbish dumps in Morocco.

55. What is scientists' other concern about white storks feeding on landfills?
A) The potential harm to the ecosystem.
B) The genetic change in the stork species.
C) The spread of epidemics to their homeland.
D) The damaging effect on bio-diversity.

　　Let's all stop judging people who talk to themselves. New research says that those who can't seem to keep their inner monologues (独白) in are actually more likely to stay on task, remain __26__ better and show improved perception capabilities. Not bad, really, for some extra muttering.
　　According to a series of experiments published in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology by professors Gary Lupyan and Daniel Swignley, the act of using verbal clues to __27__ mental pictures helps people function quicker.
　　In one experiment, they showed pictures of various objects to twenty __28__ and asked them to find just one of those, a banana. Half were __29__ to repeat out loud what they were looking for and the other half kept their lips __30__. Those who talked to themselves found the banana slightly faster than those who didn't, the researchers say. In other experiments, Lupyan and Swignley found that __31__ the name of a common product when on the hunt for it helped quicken someone's pace, but talking about uncommon items showed no advantage and slowed you down.
　　Common research has long held that talking themselves through a task helps children learn, although doing so when you've __32__ matured is not a great sign of __33__. The two professors hope to refute that idea, __34__ that just as when kids walk themselves through a process, adults can benefit from using language not just to communicate, but also to help "augment thinking".
　　Of course, you are still encouraged to keep the talking at library tones and, whatever you do, keep the information you share simple, like a grocery list. At any __35__, there's still such a thing as too much information.

Rich Children and Poor Ones Are Raised Very Differently

A) The lives of children from rich and poor American families look more different than ever before.

B) Well-off families are ruled by calendars, with children enrolled in ballet, soccer and after-school programs, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. There are usually two parents, who spend a lot of time reading to children and worrying about their anxiety levels and hectic schedules.

C) In poor families, meanwhile, children tend to spend their time at home or with extended family. They are more likely to grow up in neighborhoods that their parents say aren't great for raising children, and their parents worry about them getting shot, beaten up or in trouble with the law.

D) The class differences in child rearing are growing—a symptom of widening inequality with far-reaching consequences. Different upbringings set children on different paths and can deepen socioeconomic divisions, especially because education is strongly linked to earnings. Children grow up learning the skills to succeed in their socioeconomic stratum (阶层), but not necessarily others.

E) "Early childhood experiences can be very consequential for children's long-term social, emotional and cognitive development," said Sean Reardon, professor of poverty and inequality in education at Stanford University. "And because those influence educational success and later earnings, early childhood experiences cast a lifelong shadow." The cycle continues: Poorer parents have less time and fewer resources to invest in their children, which can leave children less prepared for school and work, which leads to lower earnings.

F) American parents want similar things for their children, the Pew report and past research have found: for them to be healthy and happy, honest and ethical, caring and compassionate. There is no best parenting style or philosophy, researchers say, and across income groups, 92% of parents say they are doing a good job at raising their children. Yet they are doing it quite differently. Middle-class and higher-income parents see their children as projects in need of careful cultivation, says Annette Lareau, whose groundbreaking research on the topic was published in her book Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race and Family Life. They try to develop their skills through close supervision and organized activities, and teach children to question authority figures and navigate elite institutions.

G) Working-class parents, meanwhile, believe their children will naturally thrive, and give them far greater independence and time for free play. They are taught to be compliant and respectful to adults. There are benefits to both approaches. Working-class children are happier, more independent, complain less and are closer with family members, Ms. Lareau found. Higher-income children are more likely to declare boredom and expect their parents to solve their problems. Yet later on, the more affluent children end up in college and on the way to the middle class, while working-class children tend to struggle. Children from higher-income families are likely to have the skills to navigate bureaucracies and succeed in schools and workplaces, Ms. Lareau said.

H) "Do all parents want the most success for their children? Absolutely," she said. "Do some strategies give children more advantages than others in institutions? Probably they do. Will parents be damaging children if they have one fewer organized activity? No, I really doubt it."

I) Social scientists say the differences arise in part because low-income parents have less money to spend on music class or preschool, and less flexible schedules to take children to museums or attend school events. Extracurricular activities reflect the differences in child rearing in the Pew survey, which was of a nationally representative sample of 1,807 parents. Of families earning more than $75,000 a year, 84% say their children have participated in organized sports over the past year, 64% have done volunteer work and 62% have taken lessons in music, dance or art. Of families earning less than $30,000, 59% of children have done sports, 37% have volunteered and 41% have taken arts classes.

J) Especially in affluent families, children start young. Nearly half of high-earning, college-graduate parents enrolled their children in arts classes before they were 5, compared with one-fifth of low-income, less- educated parents. Nonetheless, 20% of well-off parents say their children's schedules are too hectic, compared with 8% of poorer parents.

K) Another example is reading aloud, which studies have shown gives children bigger vocabularies and better reading comprehension in school. 71% of parents with a college degree say they do it every day, compared with 33% of those with a high school diploma or less. White parents are more likely than others to read to their children daily, as are married parents. Most affluent parents enroll their children in preschool or day care, while low-income parents are more likely to depend on family members. Discipline techniques vary by education level: 8% of those with a postgraduate degree say they often beat their children, compared with 22% of those with a high school degree or less.

L) The survey also probed attitudes and anxieties. Interestingly, parents' attitudes toward education do not seem to reflect their own educational background as much as a belief in the importance of education for upward mobility. Most American parents say they are not concerned about their children's grades as long as they work hard. But 50% of poor parents say it is extremely important to them that their children earn a college degree, compared with 39% of wealthier parents.

M) Less-educated parents, and poorer and black and Latino parents are more likely to believe that there is no such thing as too much involvement in a child's education. Parents who are white, wealthy or college- educated say too much involvement can be bad. Parental anxieties reflect their circumstances. High- earning parents are much more likely to say they live in a good neighborhood for raising children. While bullying is parents' greatest concern over all, nearly half of low-income parents worry their child will get shot, compared with one-fifth of high-income parents. They are more worried about their children being depressed or anxious.

N) In the Pew survey, middle-class families earning between $30,000 and $75,000 a year fell right between working-class and high-earning parents on issues like the quality of their neighborhood for raising children, participation in extracurricular activities and involvement in their children' s education.

O) Children were not always raised so differently. The achievement gap between children from high- and low-income families is 30-40% larger among children born in 2001 than those born 25 years earlier, according to Mr. Reardon's research. People used to live near people of different income levels; neighborhoods are now more segregated by income. More than a quarter of children live in single-parent households—a historic high, according to Pew—and these children are three times as likely to live in poverty as those who live with married parents. Meanwhile, growing income inequality has coincided with the increasing importance of a college degree for earning a middle-class wage.

P) Yet there are recent signs that the gap could be starting to shrink. In the past decade, even as income inequality has grown, some of the socioeconomic differences in parenting, like reading to children and going to libraries, have narrowed.

Q) Public policies aimed at young children have helped, including public preschool programs and reading initiatives. Addressing differences in the earliest years, it seems, could reduce inequality in the next generation.

36. Working-class parents teach their children to be obedient and show respect to adults.

37. American parents, whether rich or poor, have similar expectations of their children despite different ways of parenting.

38. While rich parents are more concerned with their children's psychological well-being, poor parents are more worried about their children's safety.

39. The increasing differences in child rearing between rich and poor families reflect growing social inequality.

40. Parenting approaches of working-class and affluent families both have advantages.

41. Higher-income families and working-class families now tend to live in different neighborhoods.

42. Physical punishment is used much less by well-educated parents.

43. Ms. Lareau doesn't believe participating in fewer after-class activities will negatively affect children's development.

44. Wealthy parents are concerned about their children's mental health and busy schedules.

45. Some socioeconomic differences in child rearing have shrunk in the past ten years.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　Tennessee's technical and community colleges will not outsource (外包) management of their facilities to a private company, a decision one leader said was bolstered by an analysis of spending at each campus.
　　In an email sent Monday to college presidents in the Tennessee Board of Regents system, outgoing Chancellor John Morgan said an internal analysis showed that each campus' spending on facilities management fell well below the industry standards identified by the state. Morgan said those findings—which included data from the system's 13 community colleges, 27 technical colleges and six universities—were part of the decision not to move forward with Governor Bill Haslam's proposal to privatize management of state buildings in an effort to save money.
　　"While these numbers are still being validated by the state, we feel any adjustments they might suggest will be immaterial," Morgan wrote to the presidents. "System institutions are operating very efficiently based on this analysis, raising the question of the value of pursuing a broad scale outsourcing initiative."
　　Worker's advocates have criticized Haslam's plan, saying it would mean some campus workers would lose their jobs or benefits. Haslam has said colleges would be free to opt in or out of the out souring plan, which has not been finalized.
　　Morgan notified the Haslam administration of his decision to opt out in a letter sent last week. That letter, which includes several concerns Morgan has with the plan, was originally obtained by The Commercial Appeal in Memphis.
　　In an email statement from the state's Office of Customer Focused Government, which is examining the possibility of outsourcing, spokeswoman Michelle R. Martin said officials were still working to analyze the data from the Board of Regents. Data on management expenses at the college system and in other state departments will be part of a "business justification" the state will use as officials deliberate the specifics of an outsourcing plan.
　　"The state's facilities management project team is still in the process of developing its business justification and expects to have that completed and available to the public at the end of February," Martin said. "At this time there is nothing to take action on since the analysis has yet to be completed."
　　Morgan's comments on outsourcing mark the second time this month that he has come out against one of Haslam's plans for higher education in Tennessee. Morgan said last week that he would retire at the end of January because of the governor's proposal to split off six universities of the Board of Regents system and create separate governing boards for each of them. In his resignation letter, Morgan called the reorganization "unworkable".

46. What do we learn about the decision of technical and community colleges in Tennessee?

B) It has been flatly rejected by the governor.
C) It has neglected their faculty's demands.
D) It will improve their financial situation.

A) Private companies play a big role in campus management.
B) Facilities management by colleges is more cost-effective.
C) Facilities management has greatly improved in recent years.
D) Colleges exercise foil control over their own financial affairs.

48. Workers' supporters argue that Bill Haslam's proposal would _________.
A) deprive colleges of the right to manage their facilities
B) make workers less motivated in performing duties
C) render a number of campus workers jobless
D) lead to the privatization of campus facilities

49. What do we learn from the state spokeswoman's response to John Morgan's decision?
A) The outsourcing plan is not yet finalized.
B) The outsourcing plan will be implemented.
C) The state officials are confident about the outsourcing plan.
D) The college spending analysis justifies the outsourcing plan.

50. Why did John Morgan decide to resign?

B) He disagreed with the governor on higher education policies.
C) He thought the state's outsourcing proposal was simply unworkable.
D) He opposed the governor's plan to reconstruct the college board system.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Beginning in the late sixteenth century, it became fashionable for young aristocrats to visit Paris, Venice, Florence, and above all, Rome, as the culmination (终极) of their classical education. Thus was born the idea of the Grand Tour, a practice which introduced Englishmen, Germans, Scandinavians, and also Americans to the art and culture of France and Italy for the next 300 years. Travel was arduous and costly throughout the period, possible only for a privileged class—the same that produced gentlemen scientists, authors, antique experts, and patrons of the arts.
　　The Grand Tourist was typically a young man with a thorough grounding in Greek and Latin literature as well as some leisure time, some means, and some interest in art. The German traveler Johann Winckelmann pioneered the field of art history with his comprehensive study of Greek and Roman sculpture; he was portrayed by his friend Anton Raphael Mengs at the beginning of his long residence in Rome. Most Grand Tourists, however, stayed for briefer periods and set out with less scholarly intentions, accompanied by a teacher or guardian, and expected to return home with souvenirs of their travels as well as an understanding of art and architecture formed by exposure to great masterpieces.
　　London was a frequent starting point for Grand Tourists, and Paris a compulsory destination; many traveled to the Netherlands, some to Switzerland and Germany, and a very few adventurers to Spain, Greece, or Turkey. The essential place to visit, however, was Italy. The British traveler Charles Thompson spoke for many Grand Tourists when in 1744 he described himself as "being impatiently desirous of viewing a country so famous in history, a country which once gave laws to the world, and which is at present the greatest school of music and painting, contains the noblest productions of sculpture and architecture, and is filled with cabinets of rarities, and collections of all kinds of historical relics". Within Italy, the great focus was Rome, whose ancient ruins and more recent achievements were shown to every Grand Tourist. Panini's Ancient Rome and Modem Rome represent the sights most prized, including celebrated Greco-Roman statues and views of famous ruins, fountains, and churches. Since there were few museums anywhere in Europe before the close of the eighteenth century, Grand Tourists often saw paintings and sculptures by gaining admission to private collections, and many were eager to acquire examples of Greco-Roman and Italian art for their own collections. In England, where architecture was increasingly seen as an aristocratic pursuit, noblemen often applied what they learned from the villas of Palladio in the Veneto and the evocative (唤起回忆的) ruins of Rome to their own country houses and gardens.
51. What is said about the Grand Tour?
A) It was fashionable among young people of the time.
B) It was unaffordable for ordinary people.
C) It produced some famous European artists.
D) It made a compulsory part of college education.

52. What did Grand Tourists have in common?
A) They had much geographic knowledge.
B) They were courageous and venturesome.
C) They were versed in literature and interested in art.
D) They had enough travel and outdoor-life experience.

53. How did Grand Tourists benefit from their travel?
A) They found inspiration in the world's greatest masterpieces.
B) They got a better understanding of early human civilization.
C) They developed an interest in the origin of modem art forms.
D) They gained some knowledge of classical art and architecture.

54. Why did many Grand Tourists visit the private collections?
A) They could buy unique souvenirs there to take back home.
B) Europe hardly had any museums before the 19th century.
C) They found the antiques there more valuable.
D) Private collections were of greater variety.

55. How did the Grand Tour influence the architecture in England?
A) There appeared more and more Roman-style buildings.
B) Many aristocrats began to move into Roman-style villas.
C) Aristocrats' country houses all had Roman-style gardens.
D) Italian architects were hired to design houses and gardens.

Who's really addicting you to Technology?

A."Nearly everyone i know is addicted in some measure to the internet, "wrote tony Schwartz in The New York Times. it's a common complaint these days. A steady stream of similar headlines accuse the net and its offspring apps, social media sites and online games of addicting us to distraction.

B. There's little doubt that nearly everyone who comes in contact with the net has difficulty concentration than it takes to post a status update. as one person ironically put it in the comments section of Schwartz's online article, "As I was reading this very excellent article.I stopped at least half a dozen times to cheek my email.

C.There's something different about this technology: it is both invasive and persuasive. but who's at fault for its overuse？ To find solutions, it's important to understand what we’re dealing with.There are four parties conspiring to keep you connected the tech, your boss, your friends and you.

D.The technologies themselves and their makers, are the easiest suspects to blame for our diminishing attention spans. Nicholas Carr,author of The Shallows： what the internet is doing Our brains, wrote, The net is designed to be an interruption system, a machine geared to dividing attention.

E.Online services like Facebook, twitter and the like, are called out of manipulation--making, products so good that people can't stop using them. after studying these products for several years, I wrote a book about how they do it. I learned it all starts with the business model. since these services rely on advertising revenue, The more frequently you use money they make.It’s no winder these companies employ teams of people focused on engineering their services to be as engaging as possible. these products aren't habit-forming by chance; it's by design. they have an incentive to keep us hooked.

F.However, as good as these services are, there are simple steps we can take to keep them at bay.For example, we can change how often we receive the distracting notifications that trigger our urge to check.According to Adam Marchick, CEO of mobile marketing company kahuna, less than 15 percent of smartphone users ever bother to adjust their notification setlings--meaning the remaining 85 percent of us default to the app makers' every preset trigger.Google and Apple have made it far too difficult to adjust these settings so it's up to us to take steps ensure we set these triggers to suit our own needs, not the needs of the app makers.

G.While companies like Facebook harvest attention to generate revenue from advertisers, other technologies have no such agenda. take email, for example. this system couldn't care less how often you use it. Yet to many, email is the most habit-forming medium of all.We check email at all hours of the day--we're obsessed, but why? Because that's what the boss wants.For almost all white-collar jobs, email is the primary tool of corporate communication. A slow response to a message could hurt not only your reputation but also your livelihood.

H.Your friends are also responsible.Think about this familiar scene.People gathered around a table, enjoying food and each others company. there's laughter and a bit of kidding. Then, during an interval in the conversation, someone takes out their phone to check who knows what.Barely anyone notices and no one says a thing.

I.Now imagine the same dinner,but instead of checking their phone, the person belches(打嗝）-loudly.Everyone notices. unless the meal takes place in a beer house, this is considered bad manners. The impolite act violates the basic rules of etiquette. one has to wonder why don’t we apply the same social norms to checking phones during meals, meetings and conversations as we do to other antisocial behaviors somehow, we accept it and say nothing when someone offends.

J.The reality is taking one's phone out at the wrong time is worse than belching because, unlike other minor offense, checking tech is contagious. once one person looks at their phone,other people feel compelled to do the same, starting a chain reaction. the more people are on their phones, the fewer people are talking until finally you are the only one left not reading email or checking twitter. from a societal perspective, phone checking is less like belching in public and more like another bad habit. our phones are like cigarettes-something to do when were bored or when our fingers need something to toy with seeing others enjoy a smoke,or sneak a quick glance, is too tempting to resist and soon everyone is doing it.

K.The technology, your boss, and your friends, all influence how often you find yourself using (or overusing )these gadgets. but there's still someone who deserves scrutiny--the person holding the phone. 

L. I have a confession. even though i study habit-forming technology for a living, disconnecting is not easy for me.I'm online far more than I'd like like Schwartz and so many others, I often find myself distracted and off tack.I wanted to know why so i began self-monitoring to  try to understand my behavior. that's when i discovered an uncomfortable truth. i use technology as an escape. when I'm doing something I'd rather not do, or when I'm someplace I'd rather not attention was often a good thing, like when passing time on public transportation, but frequently my tech use was not so benign. when i faced difficult work, like thinking through an article idea or editing the same draft for the hundredth time, for example, a more sinister screen would draw me in. i could easily escape discomfort.temporarlly.by answering email or browsing ing the web under the pretense of so-called"research. "though I desperately wanted to lay blame elsewhere, i finally had to admit that my bad habits had less to do with new-age.technology and more to do with old-fashioned procrastination(拖延）.

M. It's easy to blame technology for being so distracting, but distraction is nothing new. Aristotle and Socrates debated nature of “akrasia”--our tendency to do things against our interests. If we're honest with ourselves, tech is just another way to occupy our time and minds,if we weren’t on our devices. We’d likely do similarly unproductive.

N.Personal technology is indeed more engaging than ever, and there's no doubt companies are engineering their products and services to be more compelling and attractive but would want it any other way the intended result of making something better is that people use it more. that's not necessarily a problem, that's progress.

O.These improvements don't mean we shouldn't attempt to control our use of technology. In order to make sure it doesn't control us, we should come to terms with the fact that it's more than the technology itself that’s responsible for our habits. our workplace culture, social norns and individual behaviors all play a part to put technology in its place, we must be conscious not only of how technology is changing, but also of how it is changing us.

36.Online services are so designed that the more they are used, the more profit they generate.

37. The author admits using technology as an escape from the task at hand.

38. Checking phones at dinners is now accepted as normal but not belching.

39. To make proper use of technology, we should not only increase our awareness of how it is changing but also how it is impacting us.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements for each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C)and D) You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage one
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　You may have heard that Coca-Cola once contained an ingredient capable of sparking particular devotion in consumers: cocaine. The "Coca" in the name referred to the extracts of coca leaf that the drink's originator, chemist John Pemberton, mixed with his sugary syrup (浆汁). At the time, coca leaf extract mixed with wine was a common tonic (滋补品), and Pemberton's sweet brew was a way to get around local laws prohibiting the sale of alcohol. But the other half of the name presents another ingredient, less infamous (名声不好的), perhaps, but also strangely potent: the kola nut.
　　In West Africa, people have long chewed kola nuts as stimulants, because they contain caffeine that also occurs naturally in tea, coffee, and chocolate. They also have heart stimulants.
　　Historian Paul Lovejoy relates that the cultivation of kola nuts in West Africa is hundreds of years old. The leafy, spreading trees were planted on graves and as part of traditional rituals. Even though the nuts, which need to stay moist, can be somewhat delicate to transport, traders carried them hundreds of miles throughout the forests and grasslands.
　　Europeans did not know of them until the 1500s, when Portuguese ships arrived on the coast of what is now Sierra Leone. And while the Portuguese took part in the trade, ferrying nuts down the coast along with other goods, by 1620, when English explorer Richard Jobson made his way up the Gambia, the nuts were still peculiar to his eyes.
　　By the late 19th century, kola nuts were being shipped by the tonne to Europe and the US. Many made their way into medicines, intended as a kind of energy boost. One such popular medicinal drink was Vin Mariani, a French product consisting of coca extract mixed with red wine. It was created by a French chemist, Angelo Mariani, in 1863. So when Pemberton created his drink, it represented an ongoing trend. When cocaine eventually fell from grace as a beverage ingredient, kola-extract colas became popular.
　　The first year it was available, Coca-Cola averaged nine servings a day across all the Atlanta soda fountains where it was sold. As it grew more popular, the company sold rights to bottle the soda, so it could travel easily. Today about 1.9 billion Cokes are purchased daily. It's become so iconic that attempts to change its taste in 1985—sweetening it in a move projected to boost sales—proved disastrous, with widespread anger from consumers. "Coca-Cola Classic" returned to store shelves just three months after the "New Coke" was released.
　　These days, the Coca-Cola recipe is a closely guarded secret. But it's said to no longer contain kola nut extract, relying instead on artificial imitations to achieve the flavour.
　　
46. What do we learn about chemist John Pemberton?
A) He used a strangely potent ingredient in a food supplement.
B) He created a drink containing alcohol without breaking law.
C) He became notorious because of the coca drink he developed.
D) He risked breaking local law to make a drink with coca leaves.

47. What does the passage say about kola nuts?
A) Their commercial value was first discovered by Portuguese settlers.
B) They contain some kind of energy boost not found in any other food.
C) Many were shipped to Europe in the late 19th century for medicinal use.
D) They were strange to the Europeans when first imported from West Africa.

48. How come kola-extract colas became popular?
A) Cocaine had become notorious.
B) Alcoholic drinks were prohibited.
C) Fountains were set up to sell them.
D) Rights were sold to bottle the soda.

49. What is known about the taste of Coca-Cola?
A) It was so designed as to create addiction in consumers.
B) It still relies on traditional kola nut extract.
C) It has become more popular among the old.
D) It has remained virtually unchanged since its creation.

50. What is the passage mainly about?
A) The evolution of Coca-Cola.
B) The success story of Coca-Cola.
C) The medicinal value of Coca-Cola.
D) The business strategy of Coca-Cola.

Passage two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Twenty years ago, the Urban Land Institute defined the two types of cities that dominated the US landscape: smaller cities that operated around standard 9-5 business hours and large metropolitan areas that ran all 24 hours of the day. Analyzing and comparing cities using the lens of this basic divide gives interesting context to how investment capital flows and housing prices have shifted.
　　In recent years, many mid-sized cities have begun to adopt a middle-of-the-road approach incorporating the excitement and opportunity of large cities with small cities' quiet after midnight. These 18-hour cities are beginning to make waves in real estate rankings and attract more real estate investment. What is underlying this new movement in real estate, and why do these cities have so much appeal?
　　18-hour cities combine the best of 24-hour and 9-5 cities, which contributes to downtown revitalization. For decades, many downtown cores in small to mid-sized cities were abandoned after work hours by workers who lived in the suburbs. Movement out of city centers was widespread, and downtown tenants were predominantly made up of the working poor. This generated little commerce for downtown businesses in the evenings, which made business and generating tax revenue for municipal upkeep difficult. With the rise of a new concept in urban planning that aims to make life easier and more convenient, however, increasing popularity for urban areas that cased the real estate pushes, in major cities like San Francisco or New York, has inspired a type of forward thinking urbanity and in smaller cities.
　　Transforming downtown areas so that they incorporate modern housing and improved walkability to local restaurants, retail, and entertainment—especially when combined with improved infrastructure for cyclists and public transit—makes them appeal to a more affluent demographic. These adjustments encourage employers in the knowledge and talent industries to keep their offices downtown. Access to foot traffic and proximity to transit allow the type of entertainment-oriented businesses such as bars and restaurants to stay open later, which attracts both younger, creative workers and baby boomers nearing retirement alike. Because of their smaller size, most keep hours that allow people to enjoy themselves, then have some quiet after midnight, as opposed to large major cities like New York, where the buzz of activity is ongoing.
　　These 18-hour cities are rapidly on the rise and offer great opportunities for homeowner investment. In many of these cities such as Denver, a diverse and vigorous economy attracted to the urban core has offered stable employment for residents. The right urban mix has propped up home occupancy, increased property values, and attracted significant investment capital.
　　
51. What do we learn about American cities twenty years ago?
A) They were divided into residential and business areas.
B) Their housing prices were linked with their prosperity.
C) There was a clear divide between large and small cities.
D) They were places where large investment capital flowed.

52. What can be inferred from the passage about 18-hour cities?
A) They especially appeal to small businesses.
B) They have seen a rise in property prices.
C) They have replaced quiet with excitement.
D) They have changed America's landscape.

53. Years ago, many downtown cores in small to mid-sized cities .
A) had hardly any business activity
B) were crowded in business hours
C) exhibited no signs of prosperity
D) looked deserted in the evenings

54. What characterizes the new downtown areas in 18-hour cities?
A) A sudden emergence of the knowledge industry.
B) Flooding in of large crowds of migrant workers.
C) Modernized housing and improved infrastructure.
D) More comfortable life and greater upward mobility.

55. What have 18-hour cities brought to the local residents?
A) More chances for promotion.
B) Healthier living environment.
C) Greater cultural diversity.
D) Better job opportunities.

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Data sharing: An open mind on open date

[A] It is a movement building steady momentum: a call to make research data, software code and experimental methods publicly available and transparent. A spirit of openness is gaining acceptance in the science community, and is the only way, say advocates, to address a 'crisis' in science whereby too few findings are successfully reproduced. Furthermore, they say, it is the best way for researchers to gather the range of observations that are necessary to speed up discoveries or to identify large-scale trends.

[B] The open-data shift poses a confusing problem for junior researchers. On the one hand, the drive to share is gathering official steam. Since 2013, global scientific bodies have begun to back politics that support increased public access to research. On the other hand, scientists disagree about how much and when they should share date, and they debate whether sharing it is more likely to accelerate science and make it more robust, or to introduce vulnerabilities and problems. As more journals and make it more robust, or to introduce vulnerabilities and problems. As more journal and funders adopt data-sharing requirements, and as a growing number of enthusiasts call for more openness, junior researchers must find their place between adopters and those who continue to hold out, even as they strive to launch their own careers.

[C] One key challenge facing young scientists is how to be open without becoming scientifically vulnerable. They must determine the risk of jeopardizing a job offer or a collaboration proposal from those who are wary of—or unfamiliar with—open science. And they must learn how to capitalize on the movement's benefits, such as opportunities for more citations and a way to build a reputation without the need for conventional metrics, such as publication in high-impact journals.

[D] Some fields have embraced open data more than others. Researchers in psychology, a field rocked by findings of irreproducibility in the past few years, have been especially vocal supporters of the drive for more-open science. A few psychology journals have created incentives to increase interest in reproducible science—for example, by affixing an 'open-data' badge to articles that clearly state where data are available. According to social psychologist Brian Nosek, executive director of the Center for Open Science, the average data-sharing rate for the journal Psychological Science, which uses the badges, increased tenfold to 38% from 2013 to 2015.

[E] Funders, too, are increasingly adopting an open-data policy. Several strongly encourage, and some require, a date-management plan that makes data available. The US National Science Foundation is among these, some philanthropic (慈善的) funders, including the Bill&amp;Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington, and the Wellcome Trust in London, also mandate open data from their grant recipients.

[F] But many young researchers, especially those who have not been mentored in open science, are uncertain about whether to share or to stay private. Graduate students and postdocs, who often are working on their lab head's grant, may have no choice if their supervisor or another senior colleague opposes sharing.

[G] Some fear that the potential impact of sharing is too high, especially at the early stages of a career. "Everybody has a scary story about someone getting scooped (被抢先)," says New York University astronomer David Hogg. Those fears may be a factor in a lingering hesitation to share data even when publishing in journals that mandate it.

[H] Researchers at small labs or at institutions focused on teaching arguably have the most to lose when sharing hard-won data. "With my institution and teaching load, I don't have postdocs and grad students," says Terry McGlynn, a tropical biologist at California State University, Dominguez Hills. "The stakes are higher to share data because it's a bigger fraction of what's happening in my lab."

[I] Researchers also point to the time sink that is involved in preparing data for others to view. Once the data and associated materials appear in a repository (存储库 ), answering questions and handling complaints can take many hours.

[J] The time investment can present other problems. In some cases, says data scientist Karthik Ram, it may be difficult for junior researchers to embrace openness when senior colleagues—many of whom head selection and promotion committees—might ridicule what they may view as misplaced energies. "I've heard this recently—that embracing the idea of open data and code makes traditional academics uncomfortable," says Ram. "The concern seems to be that open advocates don't spend their time being as productive as possible."

[K] An open-science stance can also add complexity to a collaboration. Kate Ratliff, who studies social attitudes at the University of Florida, Gainesville, says that it can seem as if there are two camps in a field—those who care about open science and those who don't. "There's a new area to navigate—'Are you cool with the fact that I'll want to make the data open?'—when talking with somebody about an interesting research idea," she says.

[L] Despite complications and concerns, the upsides of sharing can be significant. For example, when information is uploaded to a repository, a digital object identifier (DOI) is assigned. Scientists can use a DOI to publish each step of the research life cycle, not just the final paper. In so doing, they can potentially get three citations—one each for the data and software, in addition to the paper itself. And although some say that citations for software or data have little currency in academia, they can have other benefits.

[M] Many advocates think that transparent data procedures with a date and time stamp will protect scientists from being scooped. "This is the sweet spot between sharing and getting credit for it, while discouraging plagiarism (剽窃)," says Ivo Grigorov, a project coordinator at the National Institute of Aquatic Resources Research Secretariat in Charlottenlund, Denmark. Hogg says that scooping is less of a problem than many think. "The two cases I'm familiar with didn't involve open data or code," he says.

[N] Open science also offers junior researchers the chance to level the playing field by gaining better access to crucial date. Ross Mounce, a postdoc studying evolutionary biology at the University of Cambridge, UK, is a vocal champion of open science, partly because his fossil-based research depends on access to others' data. He says that more openness in science could help to discourage what some perceive as a common practice of shutting out early-career scientists' requests for data.

[O] Communication also helps for those who worry about jeopardizing a collaboration, he says. Concerns about open science should be discussed at the outset of a study. "Whenever you start a project with someone, you have to establish a clear understanding of expectations for who owns the data, at what point they go public and who can do what with them," he says.

[P] In the end, sharing data, software and materials with colleagues can help an early-career researcher to gain recognition—a crucial component of success. "The thing you are searching for is reputation," says Titus Brown, a genomics (基因组学) researcher at the University of California, Davis. "To get grants and jobs, you have to be relevant and achieve some level of public recognition. Anything you do that advances your presence—especially in a larger sphere, outside the communities you know—is a net win."

36. Astronomer David Hogg doesn't think scooping is as serious a problem as generally thought.

37. Some researchers are hesitant to make their data public for fear that others might publish something similar before them.

38. Some psychology journals have offered incentives to encourage authors to share their data.

39. There is a growing demand in the science community that research data be open to the public.

40. Sharing data offers early-career researchers the chance to build a certain level of reputation.

41. Data sharing enables scientists to publish each step of their research work, thus leading to more citations.

42. Scientists hold different opinions about the extent and timing of data sharing.

43. Potential problems related to data sharing should be made known to and discussed by all participants at the beginning of a joint research project.

44. Sharing data and handling data-related issues can be time-consuming.

45. Junior researchers may have no say when it comes to sharing data.


Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements for each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C)and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage one
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　In the beginning of the movie I, Robot, a robot has to decide whom to save after two cars plunge into the water—Del Spooner or a child. Even though Spooner screams "Save her! Save her!" the robot rescues him because it calculates that he has a 45 percent chance of survival compared to Sarah's 11 percent. The robot's decision and its calculated approach raise an important question: would humans make the same choice? And which choice would we want our robotic counterparts to make?
　　Isaac Asimov evaded the whole notion of morality in devising his three laws of robotics, which hold that 1. Robots cannot harm humans or allow humans to come to harm; 2. Robots must obey humans, except where the order would conflict with law 1; and 3. Robots must act in self-preservation, unless doing so conflicts with laws 1 or 2. These laws are programmed into Asimov's robots—they don't have to think, judge, or value. They don't have to like humans or believe that hurting them is wrong or bad. They simply don't do it.
　　The robot who rescues Spooner's life in I, Robot follows Asimov's zeroth law: robots cannot harm humanity (as opposed to individual humans) or allow humanity to come to harm—an expansion of the first law that allows robots to determine what's in the greater good. Under the first law, a robot could not harm a dangerous gunman, but under the zeroth law, a robot could kill the gunman to save others.
　　Whether it's possible to program a robot with safeguards such as Asimov's laws is debatable. A word such as "harm" is vague (what about emotional harm? Is replacing a human employee harm?), and abstract concepts present coding problems. The robots in Asimov's fiction expose complications and loopholes in the three laws, and even when the laws work, robots still have to assess situations.
　　Assessing situations can be complicated. A robot has to identify the players, conditions, and possible outcomes for various scenarios. It's doubtful that a computer program can do that—at least, not without some undesirable results. A roboticist at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory programmed a robot to save human proxies (替身) called "H-bots" from danger. When one H-bot headed for danger, the robot successfully pushed it out of the way. But when two H-bots became imperiled, the robot chocked 42 percent of the time, unable to decide which to save and letting them both "die." The experiment highlights the importance of morality: without it, how can a robot decide whom to save or what's best for humanity, especially if it can't calculate survival odds?
　　
46. What question does the example in the movie raise?
A) Whether robots can reach better decisions.
B) Whether robots follow Asimov's zeroth law.
C) How robots may make bad judgments.
D) How robots should be programmed.

47. What does the author think of Asimov's three laws of robotics?
A) They are apparently divorced from reality.
B) They did not follow the coding system of robotics.
C) They laid a solid foundation for robotics.
D) They did not take moral issues into consideration.

48. What does the author say about Asimov's robots?
A) They know what is good or bad for human beings.
B) They are programmed not to hurt human beings.
C) They perform duties in their owners' best interest.
D) They stop working when a moral issue is involved.

49. What does the author want to say by mentioning the word "harm" in Asimov's laws?
A) Abstract concepts are hard to program.
B) It is hard for robots to make decisions.
C) Robots may do harm in certain situations.
D) Asimov's laws use too many vague terms.

50. What has the roboticist at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory found in his experiment?
A) Robots can be made as intelligent as human beings some day.
B) Robots can have moral issues encoded into their programs.
C) Robots can have trouble making decisions in complex scenarios.
D) Robots can be programmed to perceive potential perils.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Our world now moves so fast that we seldom stop to see just how far we have come in just a few years. The latest iPhone 6s, for example, has a dual-core processor and fits nicely into your pocket. By comparison, you would expect to find a technological specification like this on your standard laptop in an office anywhere in the world.
　　It's no wonder that new applications for the Internet of Things are moving ahead fast when almost every new device we buy has a plug on the end of it or a wireless connection to the internet. Soon, our current smartphone lifestyle will expand to create our own smart home lifestyle too.
　　All researches agree that close to 25 billion devices, things and sensors will be connected by 2020 which incidentally is also the moment that Millennials (千禧一代) are expected to make up 75 percent of our overall workforce, and the fully connected home will become a reality for large numbers of people worldwide.
　　However, this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg as smart buildings and even cities increasingly become the norm as leaders and business owners begin to wake up to the massive savings that technology can deliver through connected sensors and new forms of automation coupled with intelligent energy and facilities management.
　　Online security cameras, intelligent lighting and a wealth of sensors that control both temperature and air quality are offering an unprecedented level of control, efficiency, and improvements to what were once classed necessary costs when running a business or managing a large building.
　　We can expect that the ever-growing list of devices, systems and environments remain connected, always online and talking to each other. The big benefit will not only be in the housing of this enormous and rapidly growing amount of data, but will also be in the ability to run real time data analytics to extract actionable and ongoing knowledge.
　　The biggest and most exciting challenge of this technology is how to creatively leverage this ever-growing amount of data to deliver cost savings, improvements and tangible benefits to both businesses and citizens of these smart cities.
　　The good news is that most of this technology is already invented. Let's face it, it wasn't too long ago that the idea of working from anywhere and at anytime was some form of a distant Utopian (乌托邦式的) dream, and yet now we can perform almost any office-based task from any location in the world as long as we have access to the internet.
　　It's time to wake up to the fact that making smart buildings, cities and homes will dramatically improve our quality of life in the years ahead.
　　
51. What does the example of iPhone 6s serve to show?
A) The huge capacity of the smartphones people now use.
B) The widespread use of smartphones all over the world.
C) The huge impact of new technology on people's everyday life.
D) The rapid technological progress in a very short period of time.

52. What can we expect to see by the year 2020?
A) Apps for the Internet of Things.
B) The popularization of smart homes.
C) The emergence of Millennials.
D) Total globalization of the world.

53. What will business owners do when they become aware of the benefits of the Internet of Things?
A) Employ fewer workers in their operations.
B) Gain automatic control of their businesses.
C) Invest in more smart buildings and cities.
D) Embrace whatever new technology there is.

54. What is the most exciting challenge when we possess more and more data?
A) How to turn it to profitable use.
B) How to do real time data analysis.
C) How to link the actionable systems.
D) How to devise new ways to store it.

55. What does the author think about working from anywhere and at anytime?
A) It is feasible with a connection to the internet.
B) It will thrive in smart buildings, cities and homes.
C) It is still a distant Utopian dream for ordinary workers.
D) It will deliver tangible benefits to both boss and worker.

Part III                 Reading Comprehension           (40 minutes)

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

　　Many European countries have been making the shift to electric vehicles and Germany has just stated that they plan to ban the sale of vehicles using gasoline and diesel as fuel by 2030. The country is also planning to reduce its carbon footprint by 80-95% by 2050, 26 a shift to green energy in the country. Effectively, the ban will include the registration of new cars in the country as they will not allow any gasoline 27 vehicle to be registered after 2030.
　　Part of the reason this ban is being discussed and 28 is because energy officials see that they will not reach their emissions goals by 2050 if they do not 29 a large portion of vehicle emissions. The country is still 30 that it will meet its emissions goals, like reducing emissions by 40% by 2020, but the 31 of electric cars in the country has not occurred as fast as ejected.
　　Other efforts to increase the use of electric vehicles include plans to build over 1 million hybrid and electric car battery changing stations across the country. By 2030, Germany plans on having over 6 million charging stations 32 . According to the International Business Times, electric car sales are expected to increase as Volkswagen is still recovering from its emissions scandal.
　　There are 33 around 155,000 registered hybrid and electric vehicles on German roads, dwarfed by the 45 million gasoline and diesel cars driving there now. As countries continue setting goals of reducing emissions, greater steps need to be taken to have a 34 effect on the surrounding environment. While the efforts are certainly not 35 , the results of such bans will likely only start to be seen by generations down the line, bettering the world for the future.

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Apple's Stance Highlights a More Confrontational Tech Industry

[A] The battle between Apple and law enforcement officials over unlocking a terrorist's smartphone is the culmination of a slow turning of the tables between the technology industry and the United States government.

[B] After revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 that the government both cozied up to (讨好) certain tech companies and hacked into others to gain access to private data on an enormous scale, tech giants began to recognize the United States government as a hostile actor. But if the confrontation has crystallized in this latest battle, it may already be heading toward a predictable conclusion: In the long run, the tech companies are destined to emerge victorious.

[C] It may not seem that way at the moment. On the one side, you have the United States government's mighty legal and security apparatus fighting for data of the most sympathetic sort: the secrets buried in a dead mass murderer's phone. The action steins from a federal court order issued on Tuesday requiring Apple to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to unlock an iPhone used by one of the two attackers who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December.

[D] In the other corner is the world's most valuable company, whose chief executive, Timothy Cook, has said he will appeal the court's order. Apple argues that it is fighting to preserve a principle that most of us who are addicted to our smartphones can defend: Weaken a single iPhone so that its contents can be viewed by the American government and you risk weakening all iPhones for any government intruder, anywhere.

[E] There will probably be months of legal confrontation, and it is not at all clear which side will prevail in court, nor in the battle for public opinion and legislative favor. Yet underlying all of this is a simple dynamic: Apple, Google, Facebook and other companies hold most of the cards in this confrontation. They have our data, and their businesses depend on the global public's collective belief that they will do everything they can to protect that data.

[F] Any crack in that front could be fatal for tech companies that must operate worldwide. If Apple is forced to open up an iPhone for an American law enforcement investigation, what is to prevent it from doing so for a request from the Russians or the Iranians? If Apple is forced to write code that lets the FBI get into the Phone 5c used by Syed Rizwan Farook, the male attacker in the San Bernardino attack, who would be responsible if some hacker got hold of that code and broke into its other devices?

[G] Apple's stance on these issues emerged post-Snowden, when the company started putting in place a series of technologies that, by default, make use of encryption (加密）to limit access to people's data. More than that, Apple—and, in different ways, other tech companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft—have made their opposition to the government's claims a point of corporate pride.

[H] Apple's emerging global brand is privacy; it has staked its corporate reputation, not to mention the investment of considerable technical and financial resources, on limiting the sort of mass surveillance that was uncovered by Mr. Snowden. So now, for many cases involving governmental intrusions into data, once-lonely privacy advocates find themselves fighting alongside the most powerful company in the world.

[I] "A comparison point is in the 1990s battles over encryption," said Kurt Opsahl, general counsel of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy watchdog group. "Then you had a few companies involved, but not one of the largest companies in the world coming out with a lengthy and impassioned post, like we saw yesterday from Timothy Cook. Its profile has really been raised."

[J] Apple and oilier tech companies hold another ace: the technical means to keep making their devices more and more inaccessible. Note that Apple's public opposition to the government's request is itself a hindrance to mass government intrusion. And to get at the contents of a single iPhone, the government says it needs a court order and Apple's help to write new code; in earlier versions of the iPhone, ones that were created before Apple found religion on (热衷于) privacy, the FBI might have been able to break into the device by itself.

[K] You can expect that noose (束缚) to continue to tighten. Experts said that whether or not Apple loses this specific case, measures that it could put into place in the future will almost certainly be able to further limit the government's reach.

[L] That is not to say that the outcome of the San Bernardino case is insignificant. As apple and several security experts have argued, an order compelling Apple to write software that gives the FBI access to the iPhone in question would establish an unsettling precedent. The order essentially asks Apple to hack its own devices, and once it is in place, the precedent could be used to justify law enforcement efforts to get around encryption technologies in other investigations far removed from national security threats.

[M] Once aimed with a method for gaining access to iPhones, the government could ask to use it proactively (先发制人地), before a suspected terrorist attack—leaving Apple in a bind as to whether to comply or risk an attack and suffer a public-relations nightmare. "This is a brand new move in the war against encryption," Mr. Opsahl said. "We have had plenty of debates in Congress and the media over whether the government should have a backdoor, and this is an end run (迂回战术) around that—here they come with an order to create that backdoor."

[N] Yet it is worth noting that even if Apple ultimately loses this case, it has plenty of technical means to close a backdoor over time. "If they are anywhere near worth their salt as engineers, I bet they are rethinking their threat model as we speak," said Jonathan Zdziarski, a digital expert who studies the iPhone and its vulnerabilities.

[O] One relatively simple fix, Mr. Zdziarski said, would be for Apple to modify future versions of the iPhone to require a user to enter a passcode before the phone will accept the sort of modified operating system that the FBI wants Apple to create. That way, Apple could not unilaterally introduce a code that weakens the iPhone—a user would have to consent to it.

[P] "Nothing is 100 percent hacker-proof," Mr. Zdziarski said, but he pointed out that the judge's order in this case required Apple to provide "reasonable security assistance" to unlock Mr. Farook's phone. If Apple alters the security model of future iPhones so that even its own engineers' "reasonable assistance" will not be able to crack a given device when compelled by the government, a precedent set in this case might lose its lasting force. In other words, even if the FBI wins this case, in the long run, it loses.

36. It is a popular belief that tech companies are committed to protecting their customers' private data.

37. The US government believes that its access to people's iPhones could be used to prevent terrorist attacks.

38. A federal court asked Apple to help the FBI access data in a terrorist's iPhone.

39. Privacy advocates now have Apple fighting alongside them against government access to personal data.

40. Snowden revealed that the American government had tried hard to access private data on a massive scale.

41. The FBI might have been able to access private data in earlier iPhones without Apple's help.

42. After the Snowden incident, Apple made clear its position to counter government intrusion into personal data by means of encryption.

43. According to one digital expert, no iPhone can be entirely free from hacking.

44. Timothy Cook's long web post has helped enhance Apple's image.

45. Apple's CEO has decided to appeal the federal court's order to unlock a user's iPhone.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　At the base of a mountain in Tanzania's Gregory Rift, Lake Natron burns bright red, surrounded by the remains of animals that were unfortunate enough to fall into the salty water. Bats, swallows and more are chemically preserved in the pose in which they perished, sealed in the deposits of sodium carbonate in the water. The lake's landscape is bizarre and deadly—and made even more so by the fact that it's the place where nearly 75 percent of the world's flamingos (火烈鸟）are born.
　　The water is so corrosive that it can burn the skin and eyes of unadapted animals. Flamingos, however, are the only species that actually makes life in the midst of all that death. Once every three or four years, when conditions are right, the lake is covered with the pink birds as they stop flight to breed. Three-quarters of the world's flamingos fly over from other salt lakes in the Rift Valley and nest on salt-crystal islands that appear when the water is at a specific level—too high and the birds can't build their nests, too low and predators can move briskly across the lake bed and attack. When the water hits the right level, the baby birds are kept safe from predators by a corrosive ditch.
　　"Flamingos have evolved very leathery skin on their legs so they can tolerate the salt water," says David Harper, a professor at the University of Leicester. "Humans cannot, and would die if their legs were exposed for any length of time." So far this year, water levels have been too high for the flamingos to nest.
　　Some fish, too, have had limited success vacationing at the lake as less salty lagoons (泻湖) form on the outer edges from hot springs flowing into Lake Natron. Three species of tilapia (罗非鱼) thrive there part-time. "Fish have a refuge in the streams and can expand into the lagoons when the lake is low and the lagoons are separate," Harper said. "All the lagoons join when the lake is high and fish must retreat to their stream refuges or die." Otherwise, no fish are able to survive in the naturally toxic lake.
　　This unique ecosystem may soon be under pressure. The Tanzanian government has once again started mining the lake for soda ash, used for making chemicals, glass and detergents. Although the planned operation will be located more than 40 miles away, drawing the soda ash in through pipelines, conservationists worry it could still upset the natural water cycle and breeding grounds. For now, though, life prevails—even in a lake that kills almost everything it touches.

46. What can we learn about Lake Natron?
A) It is simply uninhabitable for most animals.
B) It remains little known to the outside world.
C) It is a breeding ground for a variety of birds.
D) It makes an ideal habitat for lots of predators.

47. Flamingos nest only when the lake water is at a specific level so that their babies can .
A) find safe shelter more easily
B) grow thick feathers on their feet
C) stay away from predators
D) get accustomed to the salty water

48. Flamingos in the Rift Valley are unique in that .
A) they can move swiftly across lagoons
B) they can survive well in salty water
C) they breed naturally in corrosive ditches
D) they know where and when to nest

49. Why can certain species of tilapia sometimes survive around Lake Natron?
A) They can take refuge in the less salty waters.
B) They can flee quick enough from predators.
C) They can move freely from lagoon to lagoon.
D) They can stand the heat of the spring water.

50. What may be the consequence of Tanzanian government's planned operation?
A) The accelerated extinction of flamingos.
B) The change of flamingos' migration route.
C) The overmining of Lake Natron's soda ash.
D) The disruption of Lake Natron's ecosystem.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　It is the season for some frantic last-minute math—across the country, employees of all stripes are counting backward in an attempt to figure out just how much paid time-off they have left in their reserves. More of them, though, will skip those calculations altogether and just power through the holidays into 2017: More than half of American workers don't use up all of their allotted vacation days each year.
　　Not so long ago, people would have turned up their noses at that kind of dedication to the job. As marketing professors Silvia Bellezza, Neeru Paharia, and Anat Keinan recently explained in Harvard Business Review (HBR), leisure time was once seen as an indicator of high social status, something attainable only for those at the top. Since the middle of the 20th century, though, things have turned the opposite way—these days, punishing hours at your desk, rather than days off, are seen as the mark of someone important.
　　In a series of several experiments, the researchers illustrated just how much we've come to admire busyness, or at least the appearance of it. Volunteers read two passages, one about a man who led a life of leisure and another about a man who was over-worked and over-scheduled; when asked to determine which of the two had a higher social status, the majority of the participants said the latter. The same held true for people who used products that implied they were short on time: In one experiment, for example, customers of the grocery-delivery service Peapod were seen as of higher status than people who shopped at grocery stores that were equally expensive; in another, people wearing wireless headphones were considered further up on the social ladder than those wearing regular headphones, even when both were just used to listen to music.
　　In part, the authors wrote in HBR, this pattern may have to do with the way work itself has changed over the past several decades.
　　We think that the shift from leisure-as-status to busyness-as-status may be linked to the development of knowledge-intensive economics. In such economies, individuals who possess the human capital characteristics that employers or clients value (e. g. , competence and ambition) are expected to be in high demand and short supply on the job market. Thus, by telling others that we are busy and working all the time, we are implicitly suggesting that we are sought after, which enhances our perceived status.
　　Even if you feel tempted to sacrifice your own vacation days for fake busyness, though, at least consider leaving your weekends unscheduled. It's for your own good.

51. What do most employees plan to do towards the end of the year?
A) Go for a vacation.
B) Keep on working.
C) Set an objective for next year.
D) Review the year's achievements.

52. How would people view dedication to work in the past?
A) They would regard it as a matter of course.
B) They would consider it a must for success.
C) They would look upon it with contempt.
D) They would deem it a trick of businessmen.

53. What did the researchers find through a series of experiments?
A) The busier one appears, the more respect one earns.
B) The more one works, the more one feels exploited.
C) The more knowledge one has, the more competent one will be.
D) The higher one's status, the more vacation time one will enjoy.

54. What may account for the change of people's attitude towards being busy?
A) The fast pace of life in modern society.
B) The fierce competition in the job market.
C) The widespread use of computer technology.
D) The role of knowledge in modern economy.

55. What does the author advise us to do at the end of the passage?
A) Schedule our time properly for efficiency.
B) Plan our weekends in a meaningful way.
C) Find time to relax however busy we are.
D) Avoid appearing busy when we are not.

　　Scientists scanning and mapping the Giza pyramids say they've discovered that the Great Pyramid of Giza is not exactly even. But really not by much. This pyramid is the oldest of the world's Seven Wonders. The pyramid's exact size has 26 experts for centuries, as the "more than 21 acres of hard, white casing stones" that originally covered it were 27 long ago. Reporting in the most recent issue of the newsletter "AERAGRAM," which 28 the work of the Ancient Egypt Research Associates, engineer Glen Dash says his team used a new measuring approach that involved finding any surviving 29 of the casing in order to determine where the original edge was. They found the east side of the pyramid to be a 30 of 5.5 inches shorter than the west side.
　　The question that most 31 him, however, isn't how the Egyptians who designed and built the pyramid got it wrong 4,500 years ago, but how they got it so close to 32 . "We can only speculate as to how the Egyptians could have laid out these lines with such 33 using only the tools they had," Dash writes. He says his 34 is that the Egyptians laid out their design on a grid, noting that the great pyramid is oriented only 35 away from the cardinal directions (its north-south axis runs 3 minutes 54 seconds west of due north, while its east-west axis runs 3 minutes 51 seconds north of due east)—an amount that's "tiny, but similar," archeologist Atlas Obscura points out.
　　
A) chronicles                     B) complete 
C) established                    D) fascinates 
E) hypothesis                     F) maximum 
G) momentum                    H) mysteriously 
I) perfect                        J) precision 
K) puzzled                      L) remnants 
M) removed                     N) revelations 
O) slightly


Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Peer Pressure Has a Positive Side

A) Parents of teenagers often view their children's friends with something like suspicion. They worry that the adolescent peer group has the power to push its members into behavior that is foolish and even dangerous. Such wariness is well founded: statistics show, for example, that a teenage driver with a same-age passenger in the car is at higher risk of a fatal crash than an adolescent driving alone or with an adult.

B) In a 2005 study, psychologist Laurence Steinberg of Temple University and his co-author, psychologist Margo Gardner, then at Temple, divided 306 people into three age groups: young adolescents, with a mean age of 14; older adolescents, with a mean age of 19; and adults, aged 24 and older. Subjects played a computerized driving game in which the player must avoid crashing into a wall that materializes, without warning, on the roadway. Steinberg and Gardner randomly assigned some participants to play alone or with two same-age peers looking on.

C) Older adolescents scored about 50 percent higher on an index of risky driving when their peers were in the room—and the driving of early adolescents was fully twice as reckless when other young teens were around. In contrast, adults behaved in similar ways regardless of whether they were on their own or observed by others. "The presence of peers makes adolescents and youth, but not adults, more likely to take risks," Steinberg and Gardner concluded.

D) Yet in the years following the publication of this study, Steinberg began to believe that this interpretation did not capture the whole picture. As he and other researchers examined the question of why teens were more apt to take risks in the company of other teenagers, they came to suspect that a crowd's influence need not always be negative. Now some experts are proposing that we should take advantage of the teen brain's keen sensitivity to the presence of friends and leverage it to improve education.

E) In a 2011 study, Steinberg and his colleagues turned to functional MRI (磁共振) to investigate how the presence of peers affects the activity in the adolescent brain. They scanned the brains of 40 teens and adults who were playing a virtual driving game designed to test whether players would brake at a yellow light or speed on through the crossroad.

F) The brains of teenagers, but not adults, showed greater activity in two regions associated with rewards when they were being observed by same-age peers than when alone. In other words, rewards are more intense for teens when they are with peers, which motivates them to pursue higher-risk experiences that might bring a big payoff (such as the thrill of just making the light before it turns red). But Steinberg suspected this tendency could also have its advantages. In his latest experiment, published online in August, Steinberg and his colleagues used a computerized version of a card game called the Iowa Gambling Task to investigate how the presence of peers affects the way young people gather and apply information.

G) The results: Teens who played the Iowa Gambling Task under the eyes of fellow adolescents engaged in more exploratory behavior, learned faster from both positive and negative outcomes, and achieved better performance on the task than those who played in solitude. "What our study suggests is that teenagers learn more quickly and more effectively when their peers are present than when they're on their own," Steinberg says. And this finding could have important implications for how we think about educating adolescents.

H) Matthew D. Lieberman, a social cognitive neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of the 2013 book Social: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Connect, suspects that the human brain is especially skillful at learning socially significant information. He points to a classic 2004 study in which psychologists at Dartmouth College and Harvard University used functional MRI to track brain activity in 17 young men as they listened to descriptions of people while concentrating on either socially relevant cues (for example, trying to form an impression of a person based on the description) or more socially neutral information (such as noting the order of details in the description). The descriptions were the same in each condition, but people could better remember these statements when given a social motivation.

I) The study also found that when subjects thought about and later recalled descriptions in terms of their informational content, regions associated with factual memory, such as the medial temporal lobe, became active. But thinking about or remembering descriptions in terms of their social meaning activated the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex—part of the brain's social network—even as traditional memory regions registered low levels of activity. More recently, as he reported in a 2012 review, Lieberman has discovered that this region may be part of a distinct network involved in socially motivated learning and memory. Such findings, he says, suggest that "this network can be called on to process and store the kind of information taught in school—potentially giving students access to a range of untapped mental powers."

J) If humans are generally geared to recall details about one another, this pattern is probably even more powerful among teenagers who are very attentive to social details: who is in, who is out, who likes whom, who is mad at whom. Their desire for social drama is not—or not only—a way of distracting themselves from their schoolwork or of driving adults crazy. It is actually a neurological (神经的) sensitivity, initiated by hormonal changes. Evolutionarily speaking, people in this age group are at a stage in which they can prepare to find a mate and start their own family while separating from parents and striking out on their own. To do this successfully, their brain prompts them to think and even obsess about others.

K) Yet our schools focus primarily on students as individual entities. What would happen if educators instead took advantage of the fact that teens are powerfully compelled to think in social terms? In Social, Lieberman lays out a number of ways to do so. History and English could be presented through the lens of the psychological drives of the people involved. One could therefore present Napoleon in terms of his desire to impress or Churchill in terms of his lonely gloom. Less inherently interpersonal subjects, such as math, could acquire a social aspect through team problem solving and peer tutoring. Research shows that when we absorb information in order to teach it to someone else, we learn it more accurately and deeply, perhaps in part because we are engaging our social cognition.

L) And although anxious parents may not welcome the notion, educators could turn adolescent recklessness to academic ends. "Risk taking in an educational context is a vital skill that enables progress and creativity," wrote Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, a cognitive neuroscientist at University College London, in a review published last year. Yet, she noted, many young people are especially unwilling to take risks at school—afraid that one low test score or poor grade could cost them a spot at a selective university. We should assure such students that risk, and even peer pressure, can be a good thing—as long as it happens in the classroom and not in the car.

36. It is thought probable that the human brain is particularly good at picking up socially important information.

37. It can be concluded from experiments that the presence of peers increases risk-taking by adolescents and youth.

38. Students should be told that risk-taking in the classroom can be something positive.

39. The urge of finding a mate and getting married accounts for adolescents' greater attention to social interactions.

40. According to Steinberg, the presence of peers increases the speed and effectiveness of teenagers' learning.

41. Teenagers' parents are often concerned about negative peer influence.

42. Activating the brain's social network involved in socially motivated learning and memory may allow students to tap unused mental powers.

43. The presence of peers intensifies the feeling of rewards in teens' brains.

44. When we absorb information for the purpose of imparting it to others, we do so with greater accuracy and depth.

45. Some experts are suggesting that we turn peer influence to good use in education.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　The Ebro Delta, in Spain, famous as a battleground during the Spanish Civil War, is now the setting for a different contest, one that is pitting rice farmers against two enemies: the rice-eating giant apple snail, and rising sea levels. What happens here will have a bearing on the future of European rice production and the overall health of southern European wetlands.
　　Located on the Mediterranean just two hours south of Barcelona, the Ebro Delta produces 120 million kilograms of rice a year, making it one of the continent's most important rice-growing areas. As the sea creeps into these fresh-water marshes, however, rising salinity (盐分) is hampering rice production. At the same time, this sea-water also kills off the greedy giant apple snail, an introduced pest that feeds on young rice plants. The most promising strategy has become to harness one foe against the other.
　　The battle is currently being waged on land, in greenhouses at the University of Barcelona. Scientists working under the banner "Project Neurice" are seeking varieties of rice that can withstand the increasing salinity without losing the absorbency that makes European rice ideal for traditional Spanish and Italian dishes.
　　"The project has two sides," says Xavier Serrat, Neurice project manager and researcher at the University of Barcelona, "the short-term fight against the snail, and a mid- to long-term fight against climate change. But the snail has given the project greater urgency."
　　Originally from South America, the snails were accidentally introduced into the Ebro Delta by Global Aquatic Technologies, a company that raised the snails for fresh-water aquariums (水族馆), but failed to prevent their escape. For now, the giant apple snail's presence in Europe is limited to the Ebro Delta. But the snail continues its march to new territory, says Serrat. "The question is not whether it will reach other rice-growing areas of Europe, but when."
　　Over the next year and a half investigators will test the various strains of salt-tolerant rice they've bred. In 2018, farmers will plant the varieties with the most promise in the Ebro Delta and Europe's other two main rice-growing regions—along the Po in Italy, and France's Rhone. A season in the field will help determine which, if any, of the varieties are ready for commercialization.
　　As an EU-funded effort, the search for salt-tolerant varieties of rice is taking place in all three countries. Each team is crossbreeding a local European short-grain rice with a long-grain Asian variety that carries the salt-resistant gene. The scientists are breeding successive generations to arrive at varieties that incorporate salt tolerance but retain about 97 percent of the European rice genome (基因组).
　　
46. Why does the author mention the Spanish Civil War at the beginning of the passage?
A) It had great impact on the life of Spanish rice farmers.
B) It is of great significance in the records of Spanish history.
C) Rice farmers in the Ebro Delta are waging a battle of similar importance.
D) Rice farmers in the Ebro Delta are experiencing as hard a time as in the war.
　　
47. What may be the most effective strategy for rice farmers to employ in fighting their enemies?
A) Striking the weaker enemy first. 
B) Killing two birds with one stone.
C) Eliminating the enemy one by one.
D) Using one evil to combat the other.
　　
48. What do we learn about "Project Neurice"?
A) Its goals will have to be realized at a cost.
B) It aims to increase the yield of Spanish rice.
C) Its immediate priority is to bring the pest under control.
D) It tries to kill the snails with the help of climate change.
　　
49. What does Neurice project manager say about the giant apple snail?
A) It can survive only on southern European wetlands.
B) It will invade other rice-growing regions of Europe.
C) It multiplies at a speed beyond human imagination.
D) It was introduced into the rice fields on purpose.
　　
50. What is the ultimate goal of the EU-funded program?
A) Cultivating ideal salt-resistant rice varieties.
B) Increasing the absorbency of the Spanish rice.
C) Introducing Spanish rice to the rest of Europe.
D) Popularizing the rice crossbreeding technology.
　　
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Photography was once an expensive, laborious ordeal reserved for life's greatest milestones. Now, the only apparent cost to taking infinite photos of something as common as a meal is the space on your hard drive and your dining companion's patience.
　　But is there another cost, a deeper cost, to documenting a life experience instead of simply enjoying it? "You hear that you shouldn't take all these photos and interrupt the experience, and it's bad for you, and we're not living in the present moment," says Kristin Diehl, associate professor of marketing at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business.
　　Diehl and her fellow researchers wanted to find out if that was true, so they embarked on a series of nine experiments in the lab and in the field testing people's enjoyment in the presence or absence of a camera. The results, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, surprised them. Taking photos actually makes people enjoy what they're doing more, not less.
　　"What we find is you actually look at the world slightly differently, because you're looking for things you want to capture, that you may want to hang onto," Diehl explains. "That gets people more engaged in the experience, and they tend to enjoy it more."
　　Take sightseeing. In one experiment, nearly 200 participants boarded a double-decker bus for a tour of Philadelphia. Both bus tours forbade the use of cell phones but one tour provided digital cameras and encouraged people to take photos. The people who took photos enjoyed the experience significantly more, and said they were more engaged, than those who didn't.
　　Snapping a photo directs attention, which heightens the pleasure you get from whatever you're looking at, Diehl says. It works for things as boring as archaeological (考古的) museums, where people were given eye-tracking glasses and instructed either to take photos or not. "People look longer at things they want to photograph," Diehl says. They report liking the exhibits more, too.
　　To the relief of Instagrammers (Instagram用户) everywhere, it can even make meals more enjoyable. When people were encouraged to take at least three photos while they ate lunch, they were more immersed in their meals than those who weren't told to take photos.
　　Was it the satisfying click of the camera? The physical act of the snap? No, they found; just the act of planning to take a photo—and not actually taking it—had the same joy-boosting effect. "If you want to take mental photos, that works the same way," Diehl says. "Thinking about what you would want to photograph also gets you more engaged."
　　
51. What does the author say about photo-taking in the past?
A) It was a painstaking effort for recording life's major events.
B) It was a luxury that only a few wealthy people could enjoy.
C) It was a good way to preserve one's precious images.
D) It was a skill that required lots of practice to master.
　　
52. Kristin Diehl conducted a series of experiments on photo-taking to find out _______.
A) what kind of pleasure it would actually bring to photo-takers
B) whether people enjoyed it when they did sightseeing
C) how it could help to enrich people's life experiences
D) whether it prevented people enjoying what they were doing
　　
53. What do the results of Diehl's experiments show about people taking pictures?
A) They are distracted from what they are doing.
B) They can better remember what they see or do.
C) They are more absorbed in what catches their eye.
D) They can have a better understanding of the world.
　　
54. What is found about museum visitors with the aid of eye-tracking glasses?
A) They come out with better photographs of the exhibits.
B) They focus more on the exhibits when taking pictures.
C) They have a better view of what are on display.
D) They follow the historical events more easily.
　　
55. What do we learn from the last paragraph?
A) It is better to make plans before taking photos.
B) Mental photos can be as beautiful as snapshots.
C) Photographers can derive great joy from the click of the camera.
D) Even the very thought of taking a photo can have a positive effect.

Part III              Reading Comprehension                (40 minutes)

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

　　Did Sarah Josepha Hale write "Mary's Little Lamb," the eternal nursery rhyme (儿歌) about a girl named Mary with a stubborn lamb? This is still disputed, but it's clear that the woman 26 for writing it was one of America's most fascinating 27 . In honor of the poem's publication on May 24, 1830, here's more about the 28 author's life.
　　Hale wasn't just a writer, she was also a 29 social advocate, and she was particularly 30 with an ideal New England, which she associated with abundant Thanksgiving meals that she claimed had "a deep moral influence." She began a nationwide 31 to have a national holiday declared that would bring families together while celebrating the 32 festivals. In 1863, after 17 years of advocacy including letters to five presidents, Hale got it. President Abraham Lincoln, during the Civil War, issued a 33 setting aside the last Thursday in November for the holiday.
　　The true authorship of "Mary's Little Lamb" is disputed. According to the New England Historical Society, Hale wrote only part of the poem, but claimed authorship. Regardless of the author, it seems that the poem was 34 by a real event. When young Mary Sawyer was followed to school by a lamb in 1816, it caused some problems. A bystander named John Roulstone wrote a poem about the event, then, at some point, Hale herself seems to have helped write it. However, if a 1916 piece by her great-niece is to be trusted, Hale claimed for the 35 of her lifethat "some other people pretended that someone else wrote the poem".

Grow Plants Without Water

A) Ever since humanity began to farm our own food, we’ve faced the unpredictable rain that is both friend and enemy. It comes and goes without much warning, and a field of lush (茂盛的) leafy greens one year can dry up and blow away the next. Food security and fortunes depend on sufficient rain, and nowhere more so than in Africa, where 96% of farmland depends on rain instead of the irrigation common in more developed places. It has consequences: South Africa's ongoing drought—the worst in three decades—will cost at least a quarter of its corn crop this year.

B) Biologist Jill Farrant of the University of Cape Town in South Africa says that nature has plenty of answers for people who want to grow crops in places with unpredictable rainfall. She is hard at work finding a way to take traits from rare wild plants that adapt to extreme dry weather and use them in food crops. As the earth's climate changes and rainfall becomes even less predictable in some places, those answers will grow even more valuable. "The type of farming I'm aiming for is literally so that people can survive as it's going to get more and more dry," Farrant says.

C) Extreme conditions produce extremely tough plants. In the rusty red deserts of South Africa, steep-sided rocky hills called inselbergs rear up from the plains like the bones of the earth. The hills are remnants of an earlier geological era, scraped bare of most soil and exposed to the elements. Yet on these and similar formations in deserts around the world, a few fierce plants have adapted to endure under ever-changing conditions.

D) Farrant calls them resurrection plants (复苏植物). During months without water under a harsh sun, they wither, shrink and contract until they look like a pile of dead gray leaves. But rainfall can revive them in a matter of hours. Her time-lapse (间歇性拍摄的) videos of the revivals look like someone playing a tape of the plant's death in reverse.

E) The big difference between "drought-tolerant" plants and these tough plants: metabolism. Many different kinds of plants have developed tactics to weather dry spells. Some plants store reserves of water to see them through a drought; others send roots deep down to subsurface water supplies. But once these plants use up their stored reserve or tap out the underground supply, they cease growing and start to die. They may be able to handle a drought of some length, and many people use the term "drought tolerant" to describe such plants, but they never actually stop needing to consume water, so Farrant prefers to call them drought resistant.

F) Resurrection plants, defined as those capable of recovering from holding less than 0.1 grams of water per gram of dry mass, are different. They lack water-storing structures, and their existence on rock faces prevents them from tapping groundwater, so they have instead developed the ability to change their metabolism. When they detect an extended dry period, they divert their metabolisms, producing sugars and certain stress-associated proteins and other materials in their tissues. As the plant dries, these resources take on first the properties of honey, then rubber, and finally enter a glass-like state that is "the most stable state that the plant can maintain," Farrant says. That slows the plant's metabolism and protects its dried-out tissues. The plants also change shape, shrinking to minimize the surface area through which their remaining water might evaporate. They can recover from months and years without water, depending on the species.

G) What else can do this dry-out-and-revive trick? Seeds—almost all of them. At the start of her career, Farrant studied "recalcitrant seeds (顽拗性种子)," such as avocados, coffee and lychee. While tasty, such seeds are delicate—they cannot bud and grow if they dry out (as you may know if you've ever tried to grow a tree from an avocado pit). In the seed world, that makes them rare, because most seeds from flowering plants are quite robust. Most seeds can wait out the dry, unwelcoming seasons until conditions are right and they sprout (发芽). Yet once they start growing, such plants seem not to retain the ability to hit the pause button on metabolism in their stems or leaves.

H) After completing her Ph. D. on seeds, Farrant began investigating whether it might be possible to isolate the properties that make most seeds so resilient (迅速恢复活力的) and transfer them to other plant tissues. What Farrant and others have found over the past two decades is that there are many genes involved in resurrection plants' response to dryness. Many of them are the same that regulate how seeds become dryness-tolerant while still attached to their parent plants. Now they are trying to figure out what molecular signaling processes activate those seed-building genes in resurrection plants—and how to reproduce them in crops. "Most genes are regulated by a master set of genes," Farrant says. "We're looking at gene promoters and what would be their master switch."

I) Once Farrant and her colleagues feel they have a better sense of which switches to throw, they will have to find the best way to do so in useful crops. "I'm trying three methods of breeding," Farrant says: conventional, genetic modification and gene editing. She says she is aware that plenty of people do not want to eat genetically modified crops, but she is pushing ahead with every available tool until one works. Farmers and consumers alike can choose whether or not to use whichever version prevails： "I'm giving people an option."

J) Farrant and others in the resurrection business got together last year to discuss the best species of resurrection plant to use as a lab model. Just like medical researchers use rats to test ideas for human medical treatments, botanists use plants that are relatively easy to grow in a lab or greenhouse setting to test their ideas for related species. The Queensland rock violet is one of the best studied resurrection plants so far, with a draft genome (基因图谱) published last year by a Chinese team. Also last year, Farrant and colleagues published a detailed molecular study of another candidate, Xerophyta viscosa, a tough-as-nail South African plant with lily-like flowers, and she says that a genome is on the way. One or both of these models will help researchers test their ideas—so far mostly done in the lab—on test plots.

K) Understanding the basic science first is key. There are good reasons why crop plants do not use dryness defenses already. For instance, there's a high energy cost in switching from are gular metabolism to an almost-no-water metabolism. It will also be necessary to understand what sort of yield farmers might expect and to establish the plant's safety. "The yield is never going to be high," Farrant says, so these plants will be targeted not at Iowa farmers trying to squeeze more cash out of high-yield fields, but subsistence farmers who need help to survive a drought like the present one in South Africa. "My vision is for the subsistence farmer," Farrant says. "I'm targeting crops that are of African value."

36. There are a couple of plants tough and adaptable enough to survive on bare rocky hillsand in deserts.

37. Farrant is trying to isolate genes in resurrection plants and reproduce them in crops.

38. Farmers in South Africa are more at the mercy of nature, especially inconsistent rainfall.

39. Resurrection crops are most likely to be the choice of subsistence farmers.

40. Even though many plants have developed various tactics to cope with dry weather, they cannot survive a prolonged drought.

41. Despite consumer resistance, researchers are pushing ahead with genetic modification of crops.

42. Most seeds can pull through dry spells and begin growing when conditions are ripe, but once this process starts, it cannot be held back.

43. Farrant is working hard to cultivate food crops that can survive extreme dryness by studying the traits of rare wild plants.

44. By adjusting their metabolism, resurrection plants can recover from an extended period of drought.

45. Resurrection plants can come back to life in a short time after a rainfall.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　Human memory is notoriously unreliable. Even people with the sharpest facial-recognition skills can only remember so much.
　　It's tough to quantify how good a person is at remembering. No one really knows how many different faces someone can recall, for example, but various estimates tend to hover in the thousands—based on the number of acquaintances a person might have.
　　Machines aren't limited this way. Give the right computer a massive database of faces, and it can process what it sees—then recognize a face it's told to find—with remarkable speed and precision. This skill is what supports the enormous promise of facial-recognition software in the 21st century. It's also what makes contemporary surveillance systems so scary.
　　The thing is, machines still have limitations when it comes to facial recognition. And scientists are only just beginning to understand what those constraints are. To begin to figure out how computers are struggling, researchers at the University of Washington created a massive database of faces—they call it Mega Face—and tested a variety of facial-recognition algorithms (算法) as they scaled up in complexity. The idea was to test the machines on a database that included up to 1 million different images of nearly 700,000 different people—and not just a large database featuring a relatively small number of different faces, more consistent with what's been used in other research.
　　As the databases grew, machine accuracy dipped across the board. Algorithms that were right 95% of the time when they were dealing with a 13,000-image database, for example, were accurate about 70% of the time when confronted with 1 million images. That's still pretty good, says one of the researchers, Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman. "Much better than we expected," she said.
　　Machines also had difficulty adjusting for people who look a lot alike—either doppelgangers (长相极相似的人), whom the machine would have trouble identifying as two separate people, or the same person who appeared in different photos at different ages or in different lighting, whom the machine would incorrectly view as separate people.
　　"Once we scale up, algorithms must be sensitive to tiny changes in identities and at the same time invariant to lighting, pose, age," Kemelmacher-Shlizerman said.
　　The trouble is, for many of the researchers who'd like to design systems to address these challenges, massive datasets for experimentation just don't exist—at least, not in formats that are accessible to academic researchers. Training sets like the ones Google and Face book have are private. There are no public databases that contain millions of faces. Mega Face's creators say it's the largest publicly available facial-recognition dataset out there.
　　"An ultimate face recognition algorithm should perform with billions of people in a dataset," the researchers wrote.
46. Compared with human memory, machines can ________.
A) identify human faces more efficiently
B) tell a friend from a mere acquaintance
C) store an unlimited number of human faces
D) perceive images invisible to the human eye

47. Why did researchers create Mega Face?
A) To enlarge the volume of the facial-recognition database.
B) To increase the variety of facial-recognition software.
C) To understand computers' problems with facial recognition.
D) To reduce the complexity of facial-recognition algorithms.

48. What does the passage say about machine accuracy?
A) It falls short of researchers' expectations.
B) It improves with added computing power.
C) It varies greatly with different algorithms.
D) It decreases as the database size increases.

49. What is said to be a shortcoming-of facial-recognition machines?
A) They cannot easily tell apart people with near-identical appearances.
B) They have difficulty identifying changes in facial expressions.
C) They are not sensitive to minute changes in people's mood.
D) They have problems distinguishing people of the same age.

50. What is the difficulty confronting researchers of facial-recognition machines?
A) No computer is yet able to handle huge datasets of human faces.
B) There do not exist public databases with sufficient face samples.
C) There are no appropriate algorithms to process the face samples.
D) They have trouble converting face datasets into the right format.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　There're currently 21.5 million students in America, and many will be funding their college on borrowed money. Given that there's now over $1.3 trillion in student loans on the books, it's pretty clear that many students are far from sensible. The average student's debt upon graduation now approaches $40,000, and as college becomes ever more expensive, calls to make it "free" are multiplying. Even Hillary Clinton says that when it comes to college, "Costs won't be a barrier."
　　But the only way college could be free is if the faculty and staff donated their time, the buildings required no maintenance, and campuses required no utilities. As long as it's impossible to produce something from nothing, costs are absolutely a barrier.
　　The actual question we debate is who should pay for people to go to college. If taxpayers are to bear the cost of forgiving student loans, shouldn't they have a say in how their money is used?
　　At least taxpayers should be able to decide what students will study on the public dime. If we're going to force taxpayers to foot the bill for college degrees, students should only study those subjects that're of greatest benefit to taxpayers. After all, students making their own choices in this respect is what caused the problem in the first place. We simply don't need more poetry, gender studies, or sociology majors. How do we know which subjects benefit society? Easy.
　　Average starting salaries give a clear indication of what type of training society needs its new workers to have. Certainly, there're benefits to a college major beyond the job a student can perform. But if we're talking about the benefits to society, the only thing that matters is what the major enables the student to produce for society. And the value of what the student can produce is reflected in the wage employers are willing to pay the student to produce it.
　　A low wage for elementary school teachers, however, doesn't mean elementary education isn't important. It simply means there're too many elementary school teachers already.
　　Meanwhile, there're few who're willing and able to perform jobs requiring a petroleum engineering major, so the value of one more of those people is very high.
　　So we can have taxpayers pick up students' tuition in exchange for dictating what those students will study. Or we can allow students both to choose their majors and pay for their education themselves. But in the end, one of two things is true:
　　Either a college major is worth its cost or it isn't. If yes, taxpayer financing isn't needed. If not, taxpayer financing isn't desirable. Either way, taxpayers have no business paying for students' college education.
　　
51. What does the author think of college students funding their education through loans?
A) They only expect to get huge returns. 
B) They are acting in an irrational way.
C) They benefit at taxpayers' expense.
D) They will regret doing so someday.

52. In the author's opinion, free college education is ________.
A) impractical 
B) unsustainable
C) a goal to strive for
D) a way to social equality

53. What should students do if taxpayers are to bear their college costs?
A) Work even harder to repay society.
B) Choose their subjects more carefully.
C) Choose majors that will serve society's practical needs.
D) Allow taxpayers to participate in college administration.

54. What does the author say about the value of a student's college education?
A) It is underestimated by profit-seeking employers.
B) It is to be proved by what they can do on the job.
C) It is well reflected in their average starting salary.
D) It is embodied in how they remove social barriers.

55. What message does the author want to convey in the passage?
A) Students should think carefully whether to go to college.
B) Taxpayers should only finance the most gifted students.
C) The worth of a college education is open to debate.
D) College students should fund their own education.

　　When Elon Musk says that his new priority is using artificial intelligence to build domestic robots, we should look forward to the day in admiration.
　　Mr. Musk is a guy who gets things done. The founder of two tech companies, Tesla Motors and SpaceX, is bringing electric vehicles to mass market and ___26___ humans to live on other planets. This sounds like so much hot air, but the near $13 billion fortune this entrepreneur has ___27___ comes from practical achievements rather than hypothetical ones.
　　A lot of clever people are ___28___ about artificial intelligence, fearing that robots will one day become so ___29___ that they'll murder all of us. These fears are mostly ___30___: as with hysteria about genetic modification, we humans are generally wise enough to manage these problems with speed and care.
　　And just think of how wonderful it would be if you had a live-in robot. It could, ___31___, be like having a babysitter and a nurse rolled into one—or, if that required ___32___ intelligence beyond the power of Mr. Musk's imagined machine, at least someone to chop the carrots, wash the car and mow the lawn. Once purchased and trained, this would allow the ___33___ user to save money and time, freeing up ___34___ space in our busy lives to read a good book.
　　That is why we welcome Mr. Musk's latest ___35___, and wish him well. As long as robots add to the sum of human happiness, reduce suffering, and create time to read world-class journalism, we should be their fans. Especially since journalism is one job robots will never do.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

In the real world, nobody cares that you went to an Ivy League school

A) As a high school junior, everything in my life revolved around getting into the right college. I diligently attended my SAT, ACT, and Advanced Placement test preparation courses. I juggled (尽力应付) cross-country and track schedules, newspaper staff, and my church's youth group and drama team. I didn't drink, party, or even do much dating. The right college, I thought, was one with prestige, one with a name. It didn't have to be the Ivy League, but it needed to be a "top school."

B) Looking back now, nine years later, I can't remember exactly what it was about these universities that made them seem so much better. Was it a curriculum that appeared more rigorous, perhaps? Or an alumni network that I hoped would open doors down the line? Maybe. "I do think there are advantages to schools with more recognition," notes Marybeth Gasman, a professor of higher education at the University of Pennsylvania. "I don't necessarily think that's a reason to go to one."

C) In reflection, my firm belief in the power of the brand was naive, not to mention a bit snobby. I quickly passed over state schools and southern schools, believing their curriculums to be automatically inferior to northeastern or western counterparts. Instead, I dreamed of living in New York City and my parents obliged me with a visit to New York University's (NYU) campus. During the tour, tuition fees were discussed. (NYU is consistently ranked one of the country's most expensive schools, with room and board costs totaling upwards of $ 64,000 a year.) Up until then, I hadn't truly realized just how expensive an education can be. Over the next few months, I realized not only could I not afford my dream school, I couldn't even afford the ones where I'd been accepted. City University of New York (CUNY), Rutgers University, and Indiana University were out of reach as were Mississippi State and the University of Alabama, where I would have to pay out-of-state fees. Further complicating my college search was a flourishing track career—I wanted to keep running but my times weren't quite fast enough to secure a scholarship.

D) And so, at 11 pm on the night of Georgia State University's (GSU) midnight deadline, I applied online. Rated No. 466 overall on Forbes' Lists Top Colleges, No. 183 in Research Universities, and No. 108 in the South, I can't say it was my top choice. Still, the track coach had offered me a walk-on spot, and I actually found the urban Atlanta campus a decent consolation prize after New York City.

E) While it may have been practical, it wasn't prestigious. But here's the thing: I loved my "lower-tier" (低层次的) university. (I use the term "low-tier" cautiously, because GSU is a well-regarded research institution that attracts high quality professors and faculty from all over the country.) We are taught to believe that only by going to the best schools and getting the best grades can we escape the rat race and build a better future. But what if lower-tier colleges and universities were the ticket to escaping the rat race? After all, where else can you leave school with a decent degree—but without a lifetime of debt?

F) My school didn't come prepackaged like the more popular options, so we were left to take care of ourselves, figuring out city life and trying to complete degree programs that no one was championing for us to succeed in. What I'm saying is, I loved my university because it taught us all to be resourceful and we could make what we wanted out of it.

G) I was lucky enough to have my tuition covered by a lottery-funded scholarship called HOPE(Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally). When I started college, the HOPE scholarship was funded by the state of Georgia and offered to graduating high school seniors with a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Living costs and books I paid for with money earned during high school, supplemented by a small college fund my deceased grandfather left for me and a modest savings account my parents created when I was born.

H) So what about all that name recognition? Sure, many of my colleagues and competitors have more glamorous alma maters (母校) than I do. As a journalist, I have competed against NYU, Columbia, and Northeastern graduates for jobs. And yet, not a single interviewer has ever asked me about my educational background. In fact, almost every interview I've ever had was due to a connection—one that I've gained through pure determination, not a school brand.

I) According to The Boston Globe, students who earned their bachelor's in 2012 have an average monthly loan payment of $312, which is one-third more than those who graduated in 2004. Ultimately, that's the thing universities don't want to admit. Private universities aremoney-making institutions. If you can afford to buy prestige, that's your choice. For the rest of us, however, our hearty lower-tiered universities are just fine, thank you.

J) Wealthy universities talk up the benefits their name will give graduates: namely, strong alumni networks, star faculty, and a résumé boost. But you needn't attend an Ivy League school to reap those rewards. Ludacris and the former CEO of Bank of America Ken Lewis are alumni of my college, as well as VICE's first female editor-in-chief, Ellis Jones. Successful people tend to be successful no matter where they go to school, and lower-tier schools can have alumni networks just as strong as their big name counterparts. In fact, lower-tier school alumni networks are arguably stronger, because fellow alumni recognize that you didn't necessarily have an easy path to follow. They might be more willing to offer career help, because your less famous school denotes that, like them, you are also full of energy and perseverance.

K) The Washington Post reported on a recent study by Princeton economists, in which college graduates who applied to the most selective schools in the 12th grade were compared to those who applied to slightly less selective schools. They found that students with more potential earned more as adults, and the reverse held true as well, no matter where they went to school.

L) Likewise, star faculty are not always found where you'd expect. Big name schools are not necessarily the best places for professors; plus, many professors split teaching time between multiple colleges and/or universities. This means, for instance, a CUNY student could reasonably expect to receive the same quality of instruction from a prestigious professor as they would if they were enrolled in the same class at NYU.

M) It's possible that some hiring managers may be drawn to candidates with a particular educational résumé, but it's no guarantee. According to a 2012 survey described in The Atlantic, college reputation ranked lowest in relative importance of attributes in evaluating graduates for hire, beaten out by top factors like internships, employment during college, college major, volunteer experience, and extracurriculars.

N) Maybe students who choose less prestigious universities are bound to succeed because they are determined to. I tend to think so. In any case, if I could do it again, I'd still make the same choice. Today I'm debt-free, resourceful—and I understand that even the shiniest packaging can't predict what you'll find on the inside.

36. Modest institutions can also have successful graduates and strong alumni networks.

37. The money the author made in high school helped pay for her living expenses and books at college.

38. The author came to see how costly college education could be when she was trying to choose a university to attend.

39. A recent study found that a graduate's salary is determined by their potential, not the university they attended.

40. The author cannot recall for sure what made certain top universities appear a lot better.

41. None of the author's job interviewers cared which college she went to.

42. The author thinks she did the right thing in choosing a less prestigious university.

43. In order to be admitted to a prestigious university, the author took part in various extracurricular activities and attended test preparation courses.

44. The author liked her university which was not prestigious but less expensive.

45. Colleges are reluctant to admit that graduates today are in heavier debt.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　Economically speaking, are we better off than we were ten years ago? Twenty years ago?
　　In their thirst for evidence on this issue, commentators seized on the recent report by the Census Bureau, which found that average household income rose by 5.2% in 2015. Unfortunately, that conclusion puts too much weight on a useful, but flawed and incomplete, statistic. Among the more significant problems with the Census's measure are that: 1) it excludes taxes, transfers, and compensation like employer-provided health insurance; and 2) it is based on surveys rather than data. Even if precisely measured, income data exclude important determinants of economic well-being, such as the hours of work needed to earn that income.
　　While thinking about the question, we came across a recently published article by Charles Jonesand Peter Klenow, which proposes an interesting new measure of economic welfare. While by no means perfect, it is considerably more comprehensive than average income, taking into account not only growth in consumption per person but also changes in working time, life expectancy, and inequality. Moreover, it can be used to assess economic performance both across countries and over time.
　　The Jones-Klenow method can be illustrated by a cross-country example. Suppose we want to compare the economic welfare of citizens of the U.S. and France in 2005.
　　In 2005, as the authors observe: real consumption per person in France was only 60% as high as the U.S., making it appear that Americans were economically much better off than the French on average. However, that comparison omits other relevant factors: leisure time, life expectancy, and economic inequality. The French take longer vacations and retire earlier, so typically work fewer hours; they enjoy a higher life expectancy, presumably reflecting advantages with respect to health care, diet, lifestyle, and the like; and income and consumption are somewhat more equally distributed there than in the U.S. Because of these differences, comparing France's consumption with the U.S.'s overstates the gap in economic welfare.
　　Similar calculations can be used to compare the U.S. and other countries. For example, this calculation puts economic welfare in the United Kingdom at 97% of U.S. levels, but estimates Mexican well-being at 22%.
　　The Jones-Klenow measure can also assess an economy's performance over time. According to this measure, as of the early-to-mid-2000s, the U.S. had the highest economic welfare of any large country. Since 2007, economic welfare in the U.S. has continued to improve. However, the pace of improvement has slowed markedly.
　　Methodologically, the lesson from the Jones-Klenow research is that economic welfare is multi-dimensional. Their approach is flexible enough that in principle other important quality-of-life changes could be incorporated-for example, decreases in total emissions of pollutants and declines in crime rates.
　　
46. What does the author think of the 2015 report by the Census Bureau?
A) It is based on questionable statistics. 
B) It reflects the economic changes.
C) It evidences the improved-welfare.
D) It provides much food for thought.

47. What does the author say about the Jones-Klenow method?
A) It is widely used to compare the economic growth across countries.
B) It revolutionizes the way of measuring ordinary people's livelihood.
C) It focuses on people's consumption rather than their average income.
D) It is a more comprehensive measure of people's economic well-being.

48. What do Jones and Klenow think of the comparison between France and the U. S. in terms of real consumption per person?
A) It reflected the existing big gap between the two economies.
B) It neglected many important indicators of people's welfare.
C) It covered up the differences between individual citizens.
D) It failed to count in their difference in natural resources.

49. What is an advantage of the Jones-Klenow method?
A) It can accurately pinpoint a country's current economic problems.
B) It can help to raise people's awareness of their economic well-being.
C) It can diagnose the causes of a country's slowing pace of economic improvement.
D) It can compare a country's economic conditions between different periods of time.

50) What can we infer from the passage about American people's economic well-being?
A) It is much better than that of their European counterparts.
B) It has been on the decline ever since the turn of the century.
C) It has not improved as much as reported by the Census Bureau.
D) It has not been accurately assessed and reported since mid-2000s.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　If you've ever started a sentence with, "If I were you..." or found yourself scratching your head at a colleague's agony over a decision when the answer is crystal-clear, there's a scientific reason behind it. Our own decision-making abilities can become depleted over the course of the day causing indecision or poor choices, but choosing on behalf of someone else is an enjoyable task that doesn't suffer the same pitfalls.
　　The problem is "decision fatigue," a psychological phenomenon that takes a toll on the quality of your choices after a long day of decision making, says Evan Polman, a leading psychologist.
　　Physicians who have been on the job for several hours, for example, are more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients when it's unwise to do so. "Presumably it's because it's simple and easy to write a prescription and consider a patient case closed rather than investigate further," Polman says.
　　But decision fatigue goes away when you are making the decision for someone else. When people imagine themselves as advisers and imagine their own choices as belonging to someone else, they feel less tired and rely less on decision shortcuts to make those choices. "By taking upon the role of adviser rather than decision maker, one does not suffer the consequences of decision fatigue," he says. "It's as if there's something fun and liberating about making someone else's choice."
　　Getting input from others not only offers a fresh perspective and thought process; it often also includes riskier choices. While this sounds undesirable, it can be quite good, says Polman. "When people experience decision fatigue-when they are tired of making choices—they have a tendency to choose to go with the status quo (现状)," he says. "But the status quo can be problematic, since a change in the course of action can sometimes be important and lead to a positive outcome."
　　In order to achieve a successful outcome or reward, some level of risk is almost always essential. "People who are susceptible to decision fatigue will likely choose to do nothing over something," he says, "That's not to say that risk is always good, but it is related to taking action whereas decision fatigue assuredly leads to inaction and the possible chagrin (懊恼) of a decision maker who might otherwise prefer a new course but is unfortunately hindered."
　　Just because you can make good choices for others doesn't mean you'll do the same for yourself, Polman cautions. "Research has found that women negotiate higher salaries for others than they do for themselves," he says, adding that people slip in and out of decision roles.
　　
51. What does the author say about people making decisions?
A) They may become exhausted by making too many decisions for themselves.
B) They are more cautious in making decisions for others than for themselves.
C) They tend to make decisions the way they think advantageous to them.
D) They show considerable differences in their decision-making abilities.

52. What does the example about the physicians illustrate?
A) Patients seldom receive due care towards the end of the day.
B) Prescription of antibiotics can be harmful to patients' health.
C) Decision fatigue may prevent people making wise decisions.
D) Medical doctors are especially susceptible to decision fatigue.

53. When do people feel less decision fatigue?
A) When they take decision shortcuts. 
B) When they help others to make decisions.
C) When they have major decisions to make.
D) When they have advisers to turn to.

54. What are people likely to do when decision fatigue sets in?
A) They turn to physicians for advice. 
B) They tend to make risky decisions.
C) They adopt a totally new perspective.
D) They refrain from trying anything new.

55. What does the passage say about taking some risk in decision making?
A) It is vital for one to reach the goal desired. 
B) It is likely to entail serious consequences.
C) It will enable people to be more creative.
D) It will more often than not end in regret.

Part III 	Reading Comprehension                     (40 minutes) 

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　　Just off the coast of Southern California sits Santa Cruz Island, where a magical creature called the island fox    26    . A decade ago, this island’s  ecosystem was  in   27   . Wild  pigs  attracted golden eagles from the mainland, and those   flying    28    crashed the fox population. So the Nature Conservancy launched a     29     war against the pigs, complete   with helicopters and sharp shooters.
　　　And it worked. Today, federal agencies are pulling the island fox from the Endangered Species List.  It’s  the fastest-ever recovery of a mammal, joining peers like the Louisiana black bear as glowing successes in the history of the Endangered Species Act.
　　　But the recovery of Santa Cruz Island isn’t just about the fox. The Nature Conservancy has 30 war on a multitude of invasive species here, from sheep to plants to the 31  Argentine ant. “Our philosophy with the island has always been, ‘OK,  32  the threats and let the island go back to what it was,’” says ecologist Christina Boser. And it appears to be  working. Native plants are coming back, and the fox once again bounds about carefree.
　　　But keeping those foxes from harm will occupy Boser and her colleagues for years to come. You see, humans are still allowed on Santa Cruz Island, and they bring dogs. So Boser has to vaccinate her foxes against various diseases. “We’re obligated to keep a pulse on the population for at least five years after the foxes are delisted,” says Boser. That includes tagging the foxes and 33 their numbers to ensure nothing goes wrong.
　　　This is the story of the little fox that has come back, and the people who have   34   their lives to protecting it. This is the story of wildlife conservation in the age of mass 35 .


Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding  letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Do Parents Invade Children’s Privacy When They Post Photos Online?

　　[A]When Katlyn Burbidge’s son was 6 years old, he was performing some ridiculous song and dance typical of a first-grader. But after she snapped a photo and started using her phone, he asked her a serious question:“Are you going to post that online?” She laughed and answered, “Yes, I think I will.” What he said next stopped her. “Can you not?”

　　[B]That’s when it dawned on her: She had been posting photos of him online without asking his permission. “We’re big advocates of bodily autonomy and not forcing him to hug or kiss people unless he wants to, but it never occurred to me that I should ask his permission to post photos of him online,” says Burbidge, a mom of two in Wakefield, Massachusetts. “Now when I post a photo of him online, I show him the photo and get his okay.”

　　[C]When her 8-month-old is 3 or 4 years old, she plans to start asking him in an age-appropriate way, “Do you want other people to see this?” That’s precisely the approach that two researchers advocated before a room of pediatricians (儿科医 生 ) last week at the American Academy of Pediatrics meeting, when they discussed the 21st century challenge of “sharenting,” a new term for parents’ online sharing about their children. “As advocates of children’s rights, we believe that children should have a voice about what information is shared about them if possible,” says Stacey Steinberg, a legal skills professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law in Gainesville.

　　[D]Whether it’s ensuring that your child isn’t bullied over something you post, that their identity isn’t digitally “kidnapped”, or that their photos don’t end up on a half dozen child pornography ( 色 情 ) sites, as one Australian mom discovered, parents and pediatricians are increasingly aware of the importance of protecting children’s digital presence. Steinberg and Bahareh Keith, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine, say most children will likely never experience problems related to what their parents share, but a tension still exists between parents’ rights to share their experiences and their children’s rights to privacy.

　　[E]“We’re in no way trying to silence parents’ voices,” Steinberg says. “At the same time, we recognize that children might have an interest in entering adulthood free to create their own digital footprint.” They cited a study presented earlier this year of 249 pairs of parents and their children in which twice as many children as parents wanted rules on what parents could share. “The parents said, ‘We don’t need rules—we’re fine,’ and the children said, ‘Our parents need rules,’” Keith says. “The children wanted autonomy about this issue and were worried about their parents sharing information about them.”

　　[F]Although the American Academy of Pediatrics offers guidelines recommending that parents model appropriate social media use for their children, it does not explicitly discuss oversharing by parents. “I think this is a very legitimate concern, and I appreciate their drawing our attention to it,” David Hill, a father of five, says. He sees a role for pediatricians to talk with parents about this, but believes the messaging must extend far beyond pediatricians’ offices. “I look forward to seeing researchers expand our understanding of the issue so we can translate it into effective education and policy,” he says.

　　[G]There’s been little research on the topic, Steinberg wrote in a law article about this issue. While states could pass laws related to sharing information about children online, Steinberg feels parents themselves are generally best suited to make these decisions for their families. “While we didn’t want to create any unnecessary panic, we did find some concerns that were troublesome, and we thought that parents or at least physicians should be aware of those potential risks,” Steinberg says. They include photos repurposed for inappropriate or illegal means, identity theft, embarrassment, bullying by peers or digital kidnapping.

　　[H]But that’s the negative side, with risks that must be balanced against the benefits of sharing. Steinberg pointed out that parental sharing on social media helps build communities, connect spread-out families, provide support and raise awareness around important social issues for which parents might be their children’s only voice.

　　[I]A C.S. Mott survey found among the 56 percent of mothers and 34 percent of fathers who discussed parenting on social media, 72 percent of them said sharing made them feel less alone, and nearly as many said sharing helped them worry less and gave them advice from other parents. The most common topics they discussed included kids’ sleep, nutrition, discipline, behavior problems and day care and preschool.

　　[J]“There’s this peer-to-peer nature of health care these days with a profound opportunity for parents to learn helpful tips, safety and prevention efforts, pro-vaccine messages and all kinds of other messages from other parents in their social communities,” says Wendy Sue Swanson, a pediatrician and executive director of digital health at Seattle Children’s Hospital, where she blogs about her own parenting journey to help other parents. “They’re getting nurtured by people they’ve already selected that they trust,” she says.

　　[K]“How do we weigh the risks, how do we think about the benefits, and how do we alleviate the risks?” she says. “Those are the questions we need to ask ourselves, and everyone can have a different answer.”

　　[L]Some parents find the best route for them is not to share at all. Bridget O’Hanlon and her husband, who live in Cleveland, decided before their daughter was born that they would not post her photos online. When a few family members did post pictures, O’Hanlon and her husband made their wishes clear. “It’s been hard not to share pictures of her because people always want to know how babies and toddlers (学走路的孩子) are doing and to see pictures, but we made the decision to have social media while she did not,” O’Hanlon said. Similarly, Alison Jamison of New York decided with her husband that their child had a right to their own online identity. They did use an invitation-only photo sharing platform so that friends and family, including those far away, could see the photos, but they stood firm, simply refusing to put their child’s photos on other social media platforms.

　　[M]“For most families, it’s a journey. Sometimes it goes wrong, but most of the time it doesn’t,” says Swanson, who recommends starting to ask children permission to post narratives or photos around ages 6 to 8. “We’ll learn more and more what our tolerance is. We can ask our kids to help us learn as a society what’s okay and what’s not.”

　　[N]Indeed, that learning process goes both ways. Bria Dunham, a mother in Somerville, Massachusetts, was so excited to watch a moment of brotherly bonding while her first-grader and baby took a bath together that she snapped a few photos. But when she considered posting them online, she took the perspective of her son: How would he feel if his classmates’ parents saw photos of him chest-up in the bathtub? “It made me think about how I’m teaching him to have ownership of his own body and how what is shared today endures into the future,” Dunham says. “So I kept the pictures to myself and accepted this as one more step in supporting his increasing autonomy.”

36.Steinberg argued parental sharing online can be beneficial.

37.According to an expert, when children reach school age, they can help their parents learn what can and cannot be done.

38.One mother refrained from posting her son’s photos online when she considered the matter from her son’s perspective.

39.According to a study, more children than parents think there should be rules on parents’ sharing.

40.Katlyn Burbidge had never realized she had to ask her son’s approval to put his photos online.

41.A mother decided not to post her son’s photo online when he asked her not to.

42.A woman pediatrician tries to help other parents by sharing her own parenting experience.

43.There are people who decide simply not to share their children’s photos online.

44.Parents and physicians should realize sharing information online about children may involve risks.

45.Parents who share their parenting experiences may find themselves intruding into their children’s privacy.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some question or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C)and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　Perhaps it is time for farmers to put their feet up now that robots are used to inspect crops, dig up weeds, and even have become shepherds, too. Commercial growing fields are astronomically huge and take thousands of man-hours to operate. One prime example is one of Australia’s most isolated cattle stations, Suplejack Downs in the Northern Territory, extending across 4,000 square kilometers, taking over 13 hours to reach by car from the nearest major town—Alice Springs.
　　The extreme isolation of these massive farms leaves them often unattended, and monitored only once or twice a year, which means if the livestock falls ill or requires assistance, it can be a long time for farmers to discover.
　　However, robots are coming to the rescue.
　　Robots are currently under a two-year trial in Wales which will train “farmbots” to herd, monitor the health of livestock, and make sure there is enough pasture for them to graze on. The robots are equipped with many sensors to identify  conditions of the environment, cattle and food, using thermal and vision sensors that detect changes in body temperature.
　　“You’ve also got color, texture and shape sensors looking down at the ground to check pasture quality,” says Salah Sukkarieh of the University of Sydney, who will carry out trials on several farms in central New South Wales.
　　During the trials, the robot algorithms (算法) and mechanics will be fine-tuned to make it better suited to ailing livestock and ensure it safely navigates around potential hazards including trees, mud, swamps, and hills.
　　“We want to improve the quality of animal health and make it easier for farmers to maintain large landscapes where animals roam free,” says Sukkarieh.
　　The robots are not limited to herding and monitoring livestock. They have been created to count individual fruit, inspect crops, and even pull weeds.
　　Many robots are equipped with high-tech sensors and complex learning algorithms to avoid injuring humans as they work side by side. The robots also learn the most efficient and safest passages, and allow engineers and farmers to analyze and better optimize the attributes and tasks of the robot, as well as provide a live stream giving real-time feedback on exactly what is happening on the farms.
　　Of course, some worry lies in replacing agricultural workers. However, it is farmers that are pushing for the advancements due to ever-increasing labor vacancies, making it difficult to maintain large-scale operations.
　　The robots have provided major benefits to farmers in various ways, from hunting and pulling weeds to monitoring the condition of every single fruit. Future farms will likely experience a greater deal of autonomy as robots take up more and more farm work efficiently.

　46. What may farmers be able to do with robots appearing on the farming scene? 
　A)Upgrade farm produce
B)Enjoy more leisure hours.
C)Modify the genes of crops.
D)Cut down farming costs.

　　47. What will “farmbots” be expected to do?
A)Take up many of the farmers’ routines.
B)Provide medical treatments for livestock.
C)Lead the trend in farming the world over.
D)Improve the quality of pastures for grazing.

　48. What can robots do when equipped with high-tech sensors and complex learning algorithms? 
　A)Help farmers choose the most efficient and safest passages.
B)Help farmers simplify their farming tasks and management.
C)Allow farmers to learn instantly what is occurring on the farm.
D)Allow farmers to give them real-time instructions on what to do.

　49. Why are farmers pressing for robotic farming? 
　A)Farming costs are fast increasing.
B)Robotics technology is maturing.
C)Robotic farming is the trend.
D)Labor shortage is worsening

　50. What does the author think future farms will be like? 
　A)More and more automated.
B)More and more productive.
C)Larger and larger in scale.
D)Better and better in condition.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage

　　The public must be able to understand the basics of science to make informed decisions. Perhaps the most dramatic example of the negative consequences of poor communication between scientists and the public is the issue of climate change, where a variety of factors, not the least of which is a breakdown in the transmission of fundamental climate data to the general public, has contributed to widespread mistrust and misunderstanding of scientists and their research.
　　The issue of climate change also illustrates how the public acceptance and understanding of science (or the lack of it) can influence governmental decision-making with regard to regulation, science policy and research funding.
　　However, the importance of effective communication with a general audience is not limited to hot issues like climate change. It is also critical for socially charged neuroscience issues such as the genetic basis for a particular behavior, the therapeutic potential of stem cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, or the use of animal models, areas where the public understanding of science can also influence policy and funding decisions. Furthermore, with continuing advances in individual genome ( 基 因 组 ) sequencing and the advent of personalized medicine, more non-scientists will need to be comfortable analyzing complex scientific information to make decisions that directly affect their quality of life.
　　Science journalism is the main channel for the popularization of scientific information among the public. Much has been written about how the relationship between scientists and the media can shape the efficient transmission of scientific advances to the public. Good science journalists are specialists in making complex topics accessible to a general audience, while adhering to scientific accuracy.
　　Unfortunately, pieces of science journalism can also oversimplify and generalize their subject material to the point that the basic information conveyed is obscured or at worst, obviously wrong. The impact of a basic discovery on human health can be exaggerated so that the public thinks a miraculous cure is a few months to years away when in reality the significance of the study is far more limited.
　　Even though scientists play a part in transmitting information to journalists and ultimately the public, too often the blame for ineffective communication is placed on the side of the journalists. We believe that at least part of the problem lies in places other than the interaction between scientists and members of the media, and exists because for one thing we underestimate how difficult it is for scientists to communicate effectively with a diversity of audiences, and for another most scientists do not receive formal training in science communication.
　　
51. What does the example of climate change serve to show? 
A)The importance of climate data is increasingly recognized.
B)Adequate government funding is vital to scientific research. 
C)Government regulation helps the public understand science. 
D)Common folks’ scientific knowledge can sway policy making.

52. What should non-scientists do to ensure their quality of life? 
A)Seek personalized medical assistance from doctors.
B)Acquire a basic understanding of medical science.
C)Have their individual genome sequenced.
D)Make informed use of animal models.

53. Why is it important for scientists to build a good relationship with the media?
A) It helps them to effectively popularize new scientific information.
B) It enables the public to develop a positive attitude toward science.
C) It helps them to establish a more positive public image.
D) It enables them to apply their findings to public health.

54. What does the author say is the problem with science journalism?
A) It is keen on transmitting sensational information.
B) It tends to oversimplify people’s health problems.
C) It may give inaccurate or distorted information to the public.
D) It may provide information open to different interpretations.

55. What should scientists do to impart their latest findings to the public more effectively?
A) Give training to science journalists. 
B)Stimulate public interest in science. 
C)Seek timely assistance from the media.
D)Improve their communication skills.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　Surfing the Internet during class doesn't just steal focus from the educator; it also hurts students who're already struggling to 	26	the material. A new study from Michigan State University, though, argues that all students—including high achievers—see a decline in performance when they browse the Internet during class for non-academic purposes.
　　To measure the effects of Internet-based distractions during class, researchers  27 500 students taking an introductory psychology class at Michigan State University. Researchers used ACT scores as a measure of intellectual28 . Because previous research has shown that people with high intellectual abilities are better at 29 out distractions, researchers believed students with high ACT scores would not show a 30 decrease in performance due to their use of digital devices. But students who surfed the web during class did worse on their exams regardless of their ACT scores, suggesting that even the academically smartest students are harmed when they're distracted in class.
　　College professors are increasingly 	31	alarm bells about the effects smartphones, laptops, and tablets have on academic performance. One 2013 study of college students found that 80% of students use their phones or laptops during class, with the average student checking their digital device 11 times in a 32 class. A quarter of students report that their use of digital devices during class causes their grades to 	33	.
　　Professors sometimes implement policies designed to 34 students' use of digital devices, and some instructors even confiscate (没收) tablets and phones. In a world where people are increasingly dependent on their phones, though, such strategies often fail. One international study found that 84% of people say they couldn't go a day without their smartphones. Until students are able to  35 the pull of social networking, texting, and endlessly surfing the web, they may continue to struggle in their classes.
　　


Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

A Pioneering Woman of Science Re-Emerges after 300 Years

　　[A]Maria Sibylla Merian, like many European women of the 17th century, stayed busy managing a household and rearing children. But on top of that, Merian, a German-born woman who lived in the Netherlands, also managed a successful career as an artist, botanist, naturalist and entomologist （昆虫学家）.

　　[B]“She was a scientist on the level with a lot of people we spend a lot of time talking about,” said Kay Etheridge, a biologist at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania who has been studying the scientific history of Merian’s work. “She didn't do as much to change biology as Charles Darwin, but she was significant.”

　　[C]At a time when natural history was a valuable tool for discovery, Merian discovered facts about plants and insects that were not previously known. Her observations helped dismiss the popular belief that insects spontaneously emerged from mud. The knowledge she collected over decades didn't just satisfy those curious about nature, but also provided valuable insights into medicine and science. She was the first to bring together insects and their habitats, including food they ate, into a single ecological composition.

　　[D]After years of pleasing a fascinated audience across Europe with books of detailed descriptions and life-size paintings of familiar insects, in 1699 she sailed with her daughter nearly 5,000 miles from the Netherlands to South America to study insects in the jungles of what is now known as Suriname. She was 52 years old. The result was her masterpiece, Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium.

　　[E]In her work, she revealed a side of nature so exotic, dramatic and valuable to Europeans of the time that she received much acclaim. But a century later, her findings came under scientific criticism. Shoddy （粗糙的）reproductions of her work along with setbacks to women's roles in 18th- and 19th-century Europe resulted in her efforts being largely forgotten. “It was kind of stunning when she sort of dropped off into oblivion （遗忘）,” said Dr. Etheridge. “Victorians started putting women in a box, and they're still trying to crawl out of it.”

　　[F]Today, the pioneering woman of the sciences has re-emerged. In recent years, feminists, historians and artists have all praised Merian's tenacity （坚韧）, talent and inspirational artistic compositions. And now biologists like Dr. Etheridge are digging into the scientific texts that accompanied her art. Three hundred years after her death, Merian will be celebrated at an international symposium in Amsterdam this June.

　　[G]And last month, Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium was republished. It contains 60 plates  （插图） and original descriptions, along with stories about Merian's life and updated scientific descriptions. Before writing Metamorphosis, Merian spent decades documenting European plants and insects that she published in a series of books. She began in her 20s, making textless, decorative paintings of flowers with insects. “Then she got really serious,” Dr. Etheridge said. Merian started raising insects at home, mostly butterflies and caterpillars. “She would sit up all night until they came out of the pupa （蛹） so she could draw them,” she said.

　　[H]The results of her decades' worth of careful observations were detailed paintings and descriptions of European insects, followed by unconventional visuals and stories of insects and animals from a land that most at the time could only imagine. It's possible Merian used a magnifying glass to capture the detail of the split tongues of sphinx moths （斯芬克斯飞蛾） depicted in the painting. She wrote that the two tongues combine to form one tube for drinking nectar （花蜜）.Some criticized this detail later, saying there was just one tongue, but Merian wasn't wrong. She may have observed the adult moth just as it emerged from its pupa. For a brief moment during that stage of its life cycle, the tongue consists of two tiny half-tubes before merging into one.

　　[I]It may not have been ladylike to depict a giant spider devouring a hummingbird, but when Merian did it at the turn of the 18th century, surprisingly, nobody objected. Dr. Etheridge called it revolutionary. The image, which also contained novel descriptions of ants, fascinated a European audience that was more concerned with the exotic story unfolding before them than the gender of the person who painted it.

　　[J]“All of these things shook up their nice, neat little view,” Dr. Etheridge said. But later, people of the Victorian era thought differently. Her work had been reproduced, sometimes incorrectly. A few observations were deemed impossible. “She'd been called a silly woman for saying that a spider could eat a bird,” Dr. Etheridge said. But Henry Walter Bates, a friend of Charles Darwin, observed it and put it in book in 1863, proving Merian was correct.

　　[K]In the same plate, Merian depicted and described leaf-cutter ants for the first time. “In America there are large ants which can eat whole trees bare as a broom handle in a single night,” she wrote in the description. Merian noted how the ants took the leaves below ground to their young. And she wouldn't have known this at the time, but the ants use the leaves to farm fungi （菌类） underground to feed their developing babies.

　　[L]Merian was correct about the giant bird-eating spiders, ants building bridges with their bodies and other details. But in the same drawing, she incorrectly lumped together army and leaf-cutter ants. And instead of showing just the typical pair of eggs in a hummingbird nest, she painted four. She made other mistakes in Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium as well: not every caterpillar and butterfly matched.

　　[M]Perhaps one explanation for her mistakes is that she cut short her Suriname trip after getting sick, and completed the book at home in Amsterdam. And errors are common among some of history's most-celebrated scientific minds, too. “These errors no more invalidate Ms. Merian's work than do well-known misconceptions published by Charles Darwin or Isaac Newton,” Dr. Etheridge wrote in a paper that argued that too many have wrongly focused on the mistakes of her work.

　　[N]Merian’s paintings inspired artists and ecologists. In an 1801 drawing from his book, General Zoology Amphibia, George Shaw, an English botanist and zoologist, credited Merian for describing a frog in the account of her South American expedition, and named the young tree frog after her in his portrayal of it. It wouldn't be fair to give Merian all the credit. She received assistance naming plants, making sketches and referencing the work of others. Her daughters helped her color her drawings.

　　[O]Merian also made note of the help she received from the natives of Suriname, as well as slaves or servants that assisted her. In some instances she wrote moving passages that included her helpers in descriptions. As she wrote in her description of the peacock flower, “The Indians, who are not treated well by their Dutch masters, use the seeds to abort their children, so that they will not become slaves like themselves. The black slaves from Guinea and Angola have demanded to be well treated, threatening to refuse to have children. In fact, they sometimes take their own lives because they are treated so badly, and because they believe they will be born again, free and living in their own land. They told me this themselves.”

　　[P]Londa Schiebinger, a professor of the history of science at Stanford University, called this passage rather astonishing. It's particularly striking centuries later when these issues are still prominent in public discussions about social justice and women’s rights. “She was ahead of her time,” Dr. Etheridge said.

36.Merian was the first scientist to study a type of American ant.

37.The European audience was more interested in Merian's drawings than her gender. 

38.  Merian's masterpiece came under attack a century after its publication.

39.Merian’s mistakes in her drawings may be attributed to her shortened stay in South America.

40.Merian often sat up the whole night through to observe and draw insects.

41.Merian acknowledged the help she got from natives of South America.

42.Merian contributed greatly to people's better understanding of medicine and science.

43.Merian occasionally made mistakes in her drawings of insects and birds.

44.Now, Merian's role as a female forerunner in sciences has been re-established.

45.Merian made a long voyage to South America to study jungle insects over three centuries ago.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some question or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C)and D).

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　While human achievements in mathematics continue to reach new levels of complexity, many of us who aren't mathematicians at heart (or engineers by trade) may struggle to remember the last time we used calculus (微积分).
　　It’s a fact not lost on American educators, who amid rising math failure rates are debating how math can better meet the real-life needs of students. Should we change the way math is taught in schools, or eliminate some courses entirely?
　　Andrew Hacker, Queens College political science professor, thinks that advanced algebra and other higher-level math should be cut from curricula in favor of courses with more routine usefulness, like statistics.
　　“We hear on all sides that we're not teaching enough mathematics, and the Chinese are running rings around us,” Hacker says. “I'm suggesting we're teaching too much mathematics to too many people…not everybody has to know calculus. If you're going to become an aeronautical (航空的) engineer, fine. But most of us aren't.”
　　Instead, Hacker is pushing for more courses like the one he teaches at Queens College： Numeracy 101. There, his students of “citizen statistics” learn to analyze public information like the federal budget and corporate reports. Such courses, Hacker argues, are a remedy for the numerical illiteracy of adults who have completed high-level math like algebra but are unable to calculate the price of, say, a carpet by area.
　　Hacker's argument has met with opposition from other math educators who say what's needed is to help students develop a better relationship with math earlier, rather than teaching them less math altogether.
　　Maria Droujkova is a founder of Natural Math, and has taught basic calculus concepts to 5-year-olds. For Droujkova, high-level math is important, and what it could use in American classrooms is an injection of childlike wonder.
　　“Make mathematics more available,” Droujkova says. “Redesign it so it's more accessible to more kinds of people: young children, adults who worry about it, adults who may have had bad experiences.”
　　Pamela Harris, a lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin, has a similar perspective. Harris says that American education is suffering from an epidemic of “fake math”—an emphasis on rote memorization (死记硬背) of formulas and steps, rather than an understanding of how math can influence the ways we see the world.
　　Andrew Hacker, for the record, remains skeptical.
　　“I'm going to leave it to those who are in mathematics to work out the ways to make their subject interesting and exciting so students want to take it,” Hacker says. “All that I ask is that alternatives be offered instead of putting all of us on the road to calculus.”

　　46. What does the author say about ordinary Americans? 
　　A)They struggle to solve math problems.
B)They think math is a complex subject.
C)They find high-level math of little use.
D)They work hard to learn high-level math.

　47. What is the general complaint about America's math education according to Hacker? 
　A)America is not doing as well as China.
B)Math professors are not doing a good job.
C)It doesn't help students develop their literacy.
D)There has hardly been any innovation for years.

　48. What does Andrew Hacker's Numeracy 101 aim to do? 
　A)Allow students to learn high-level math step by step.
B)Enable students to make practical use of basic math.
C)Lay a solid foundation for advanced math studies.
D)Help students to develop their analytical abilities.

　49. What does Maria Droujkova suggest math teachers do in class? 
　A)Make complex concepts easy to understand.
B)Start teaching children math at an early age.
C)Help children work wonders with calculus.
D)Try to arouse students' curiosity in math.

　50. What does Pamela Harris think should be the goal of math education? 
　A)To enable learners to understand the world better.
B)To help learners to tell fake math from real math.
C)To broaden Americans' perspectives on math.
D)To exert influence on world development.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage

　　For years, the U.S. has experienced a shortage of registered nurses. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that while the number of nurses will increase by 19 percent by 2022, demand will grow faster than supply, and that there will be over one million unfilled nursing jobs by then.
　　So what's the solution? Robots.
　　Japan is ahead of the curve when it comes to this trend. Toyohashi University of Technology has developed Terapio, a robotic medical cart that can make hospital rounds, deliver medications and other items, and retrieve records. It follows a specific individual, such as a doctor or nurse, who can use it to record and access patient data. This type of robot will likely be one of the first to be implemented in hospitals because it has fairly minimal patient contact.
　　Robots capable of social engagement help with loneliness as well as cognitive functioning, but the robot itself doesn't have to engage directly—it can serve as an intermediary for human communication. Telepresence robots such as MantaroBot, Vgo, and Giraff can be controlled through a computer, smartphone, or tablet, allowing family members or doctors to remotely monitor patients or Skype them, often via a screen where the robot's ‘face’ would be. If you can't get to the nursing home to visit grandma, you can use a telepresence robot to hang out with her. A 2016 study found that users had a “consistently positive attitude” about the Giraff robot's ability to enhance communication and decrease feelings of loneliness.
　　A robot's appearance affects its ability to successfully interact with humans, which is why the RIKEN-TRI Collaboration Center for Human-Interactive Robot Research decided to develop a robotic nurse that looks like a huge teddy bear. RIBA (Robot for Interactive Body Assistance), also known as “Robear,” can help patients into and out of wheelchairs and beds with its strong arms.
　　On the less cute and more scary side there is Actroid F, which is so human-like that some patients may not know the difference. This conversational robot companion has cameras in its eyes, which allow it to track patients and use appropriate facial expressions and body language in its interactions. During a month-long hospital trial, researchers asked 70 patients how they felt being around the robot and “only three or four said they didn't like having it around.”
　　It's important to note that robotic nurses don't decide courses of treatment or make diagnoses (though robot doctors and surgeons may not be far off). Instead, they perform routine and laborious tasks, freeing nurses up to attend to patients with immediate needs. This is one industry where it seems the integration of robots will lead to collaboration, not replacement.

　51. What does the author say about Japan?
A)It delivers the best medications for the elderly.
B)It takes the lead in providing robotic care.
C)It provides retraining for registered nurses.
D)It sets the trend in future robotics technology.

　52. What do we learn about the robot Terapio?
　A) It has been put to use in many Japanese hospitals.
　B) It provides specific individualized care to patients.
　C) It does not have much direct contact with patients.
　D) It has not revolutionized medical service in Japan.

　53. What are telepresence robots designed to do?
　A) Directly interact with patients to prevent them from feeling lonely.
　B) Cater to the needs of patients for recovering their cognitive capacity.
　C) Closely monitor the patients' movements and conditions around the clock. 
　D)Facilitate communication between patients and doctors or family members.

　　54. What is one special feature of the robot Actroid F?
　A) It interacts with patients just like a human companion.
　B) It operates quietly without patients realizing its presence.
　C) It likes to engage in everyday conversations with patients.
　D) It uses body language even more effectively than words.
　
　55. What can we infer from the last paragraph? 
　A)Doctors and surgeons will soon be laid off.
B)The robotics industry will soon take off.
C)Robots will not make nurses redundant.
　 D)Collaboration will not replace competition.

Part III                             Reading Comprehension                           (40 minutes) 

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

In what’s probably the  craziest headline I’ve  ever  written, I’ve  reported that  26  in livestock protection are  happening with scientists painting eyes on the butts of cows. The experiment is based upon the idea that farmers who’re protecting their herd from lions would shoot and kill lions in an effort to protect their livestock. While this makes a lot of sense, it results in many lion deaths that 27 would have been unnecessary. Researchers in Australia have been  28  and testing a method of trickery to make lions think they are being watched by the painted eyes on cow butts.
This idea is based on the principle that lions and other 29 are far less likely to attack when they feel they are being watched. As conservation areas become smaller, lions are increasingly coming into contact with human populations, which are expanding to the 30 of these protected areas.
Efforts like painting eyes on cow butts may seem crazy at first, but they could make actual headway in the fight for conservation. “If the method works, it could provide farmers in Botswana—and    31    —with a low-cost, sustainable tool  to protect their livestock, and a way to keep lions safe from being killed.”
Lions are 32 ambush（埋伏）hunters, so when they feel their prey has  33 them, they usually give up on the hunt. Researchers are 34 testing their idea on a select herd of cattle. They have painted half of the cows with eyes and left the other half as normal. Through satellite tracking of both the herd and the lions in the area, they will be able to 35 if their psychological trickery will work to help keep farmers from shooting lions.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding  letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Resilience Is About How You Recharge, Not How You Endure

　　10.As constant travelers and parents of a 2-year-old, we sometimes fantasize about how much work we can do when one of us gets on a plane, undistracted by phones, friends, or movies. We race to get all our ground work done: packing, going through security, doing a last-minute work call, calling each other, then boarding the plane. Then, when we try to have that amazing work session in flight, we get nothing done. Even worse, after refreshing our email or reading the same studies over and over, we are too exhausted when we land to soldier on with（继续处理）the emails that have inevitably still piled up.

　　11.Why should flying deplete us? We’re just sitting there doing nothing. Why can’t we be tougher, more resilient（有复原力的）and determined in our work so we can accomplish all of the goals we set for ourselves? Based on our current research, we have come to realize that the problem is not our hectic schedule or the plane travel itself; the problem comes from a misconception of what it means to be resilient, and the resulting impact of overworking.

　　12.We often take a militaristic, “tough” approach to resilience and determination like a Marine pulling himself through the mud, a boxer going one more round, or a football player picking himself up off the ground for one more play. We believe that the longer we tough it out, the tougher we are, and therefore the more successful we will be. However, this entire conception is scientifically inaccurate.

　　13.The very lack of a recovery period is dramatically holding back our collective ability to be resilient and successful. Research has found that there is a direct correlation between lack of recovery and increased incidence of health and safety problems. And lack of recovery—whether by disrupting sleep with thoughts of work or having continuous cognitive arousal by watching our phones—is costing our companies $62 billion a year in lost productivity.

　　14.And just because work stops, it doesn’t mean we are recovering. We “stop” work sometimes at 5 pm, but then we spend the night wrestling with solutions to work problems, talking about our work over dinner, and falling asleep thinking about how much work we’ll do tomorrow. In a study just released, researchers from Norway found that 7.8% of Norwegians have become workaholics（工作狂）. The scientists cite a definition of “workaholism” as “being overly concerned about work, driven by an uncontrollable work motivation, and investing so much time and effort in work that it impairs other important life areas.”

　　15.We believe that the number of people who fit that definition includes the majority of American workers, which prompted us to begin a study of workaholism in the U.S.. Our study will use a large corporate dataset from a major medical company to examine how technology extends our working hours and thus interferes with necessary cognitive recovery, resulting in huge health care costs and turnover costs for employers.

　　16.The misconception of resilience is often bred from an early age. Parents trying to teach their children resilience might celebrate a high school student staying up until 3 am to finish a science fair project. What a distortion of resilience! A resilient child is a well-rested one. When an exhausted student goes to school, he risks hurting everyone on the road with his impaired driving; he doesn’t have the cognitive resources to do well on his English test; he has lower self-control with his friends; and at home, he is moody with his parents. Overwork and exhaustion are the opposite of resilience and the bad habits we acquire when we’re young only magnify when we hit the workforce.

　　17.As Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz have written, if you have too much time in the performance zone, you need more time in the recovery zone, otherwise you risk burnout. Gathering your resources to “try hard” requires burning energy in order to overcome your currently low arousal level. It also worsens exhaustion. Thus the more imbalanced we become due to overworking, the more value there is in activities that allow us to return to a state of balance. The value of a recovery period rises in proportion to the amount of work required of us.

　　18.So how do we recover and build resilience? Most people assume that if you stop doing a task like answering emails or writing a paper, your brain will naturally recover, so that when you start again later in the day or the next morning, you’ll have your energy back. But surely everyone reading this has had times when you lie in bed for hours, unable to fall asleep because your brain is thinking about work. If you lie in bed for eight hours, you may have rested, but you can still feel exhausted the next day. That’s because rest and recovery are not the same thing.

　　19.If you’re trying to build resilience at work, you need adequate internal and external recovery periods. As researchers Zijlstra, Cropley and Rydstedt write in their 2014 paper: “Internal recovery refers to the shorter periods of relaxation that take place within the frames of the work day or the work setting in the form of short scheduled or unscheduled breaks, by shifting attention or changing to other work tasks when the mental or physical resources required for the initial task are temporarily depleted or exhausted. External recovery refers to actions that take place outside of work—e.g. in the free time between the work days, and during weekends, holidays or vacations.” If after work you lie around on your bed and get irritated by political commentary on your phone or get stressed thinking about decisions about how to renovate your home, your brain has not received a break from high mental arousal states. Our brains need a rest as much as our bodies do.

　　20.If you really want to build resilience, you can start by strategically stopping. Give yourself the resources to be tough by creating internal and external recovery periods. Amy Blankson describes how to strategically stop during the day by using technology to control overworking. She suggests downloading the Instant or Moment apps to see how many times you turn on your phone each day. You can also use apps like Offtime or Unplugged to create tech free zones by strategically scheduling automatic airplane modes. The average person turns on their phone 150 times every day. If every distraction took only 1 minute, that would account for 2.5 hours a day.

　　21.In addition, you can take a cognitive break every 90 minutes to charge your batteries. Try to not have lunch at your desk, but instead spend time outside or with your friends—not talking about work. Take all of your paid time off, which not only gives you recovery periods, but raises your productivity and likelihood of promotion.

　　22.As for us, we’ve started using our plane time as a work-free zone, and thus time to dip into the recovery phase. The results have been fantastic. We are usually tired already by the time we get on a plane, and the crowded space and unstable internet connection make work more challenging. Now, instead of swimming upstream, we relax, sleep, watch movies, or listen to music. And when we get off the plane, instead of being depleted, we feel recovered and ready to return to the performance zone.

E)It has been found that inadequate recovery often leads to poor health and accidents.

F)Mental relaxation is much needed, just as physical relaxation is.

G)Adequate rest not only helps one recover, but also increases one’s work efficiency.

H)The author always has a hectic time before taking a flight.

I)Recovery may not take place even if one seems to have stopped working.

J)It is advised that technology be used to prevent people from overworking.

K)Contrary to popular belief, rest does not equal recovery.

L)The author has come to see that his problem results from a misunderstanding of the meaning of resilience.

M)People’s distorted view about resilience may have developed from their upbringing.

N)People tend to think the more determined they are, the greater their success will be.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some question or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C)and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

Children with attention problems in early childhood were 40% less likely to graduate from high school, says a new study from Duke University.
The study included 386 kindergarteners from schools in the Fast Track Project, a multi-site clinical trial in the U.S. that in 1991 began tracking how children developed across their lives.
With this study, researchers examined early academic attention and socio-emotional skills and how each contributed to academic success into young adulthood.
They found that early attention skills were the most consistent predictor of academic success, and that likability by peers also had a modest effect on academic performance.
By fifth grade, children with early attention difficulties had lower grades and reading achievement scores than their peers. As fifth-graders, children with early attention problems obtained average reading scores at least 3% lower than their contemporaries’ and grades at least 8% lower than those of their peers. This was after controlling for IQ, socio-economic status and academic skills at school entry.
Although these may not seem like large effects, the impact of early attention problems continued throughout the children’s academic careers. Lower reading achievement scores and grades in fifth grade contributed to reduced grades in middle school and thereby contributed to a 40% lower high school graduation rate.
“The children we identified as having attention difficulties were not diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder（注意力缺乏多动症）（ADHD）, although some may have had the disorder. Our findings suggest that even more modest attention dean of Duke’s Trinity College of Arts & Sciences, whose research has focused on ADHD and interventions to improve academic performance in children with attention difficulties.
Social acceptance by peers in early childhood also predicted grades in fifth grade. Children not as liked by their first-grade peers had slightly lower grades in fifth grade, while those with higher social acceptance had higher grades.
“This study shows the importance of so-called ‘non-cognitive’ or soft skills in contributing to children’s positive peer relationships, which, in turn, contribute to their academic success,” said Kenneth Dodge, director of the Duke Center for Child and Family Policy.
The results highlight the need to develop effective early interventions to help those with attention problems stay on track academically and for educators to encourage positive peer relationships, the researchers said.
“We’re learning that student success requires a more comprehensive approach, one that incorporates not only academic skills but also social, self-regulatory and attention skills,” Dodge said. “If we neglect any of these areas, the child’s development lags. If we attend to these areas, a child’s success may reinforce itself with positive feedback loops.”

O)What is the focus of the new study from Duke University? 
A)The contributors to children’s early attention.
•The predictors of children’s academic success.
•The factors that affect children’s emotional well-being.
D) The determinants of children’s development of social skills.

P)How did the researchers ensure that their findings are valid?
E)By attaching equal importance to all possible variables examined.
F)By collecting as many typical samples as were necessary.
G)By preventing them from being affected by factors not under study.
H)By focusing on the family background of the children being studied.

Q)What do we learn from the findings of the Duke study?
E)Modest students are generally more attentive than their contemporaries.
F)There are more children with attention difficulties than previously thought. 
　C)Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder accounts for most academic failures. 
　D)Children’s academic performance may suffer from even slight inattention.
　
R)What does the Duke study find about children better accepted by peers? 
　A)They do better academically.	
　B)They are easy to get on with. 
　C)They are teachers’ favorites.	
　D)They care less about grades.
　
S)What can we conclude from the Duke study?
A)Children’s success is related to their learning environment. 
B)School curriculum should cover a greater variety of subjects.
E)Social skills are playing a key role in children’s development.
F)An all-round approach should be adopted in school education.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage

On Jan.9,2007, Steve Jobs formally announced Apple’s “revolutionary mobile phone” — a device that combined the functionality of an iPod, phone and Internet communication into a single unit, navigated by touch.
It was a huge milestone in the development of smartphones, which are now owned by a majority of American adults and are increasingly common across the globe.
As smartphones have multiplied, so have questions about their impact on how we live and how we work. Often the advantages of convenient, mobile technology are both obvious and taken for granted, leaving more subtle topics for concerned discussion: Are smartphones disturbing children’s sleep? Is an inability to get away from work having a negative impact on health? And what are the implications for privacy?
But today, on the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, let’s take a moment to consider a less obvious advantage: the potential for smartphone technology to revolutionize behavioral science. That’s because, for the first time in human history, a large proportion of the species is in continuous contact with technology that can record key features of an individual’s behavior and environment.
Researchers have already begun to use smartphones in social scientific research, either to query people  regularly as they engage in their normal lives or to record activity using the device’s built-in sensors. These studies are confirming, challenging and extending what’s been found using more traditional approaches, in which people report how they behaved in real life or participate in relatively short and artificial laboratory-based tasks.
Such studies are just first steps. As more data are collected and methods for analysis improve, researchers will be in a better position to identify how different experiences, behaviors and environments relate to each other and evolve over time, with the potential to improve people’s productivity and wellbeing in a variety of domains. Beyond revealing population-wide patterns, the right combination of data and analysis can also help individuals identify unique characteristics of their own behavior, including conditions that could indicate the need for some form of intervention—such as an unusual increase in behaviors that signal a period of depression.
Smartphone-based data collection comes at an appropriate time in the evolution of psychological science. Today, the field is in transition, moving away from a focus on laboratory studies with undergraduate participants towards more complex, real-world situations studied with more diverse groups of people. Smartphones offer new tools for achieving these ambitions, providing rich data about everyday behaviors in a variety of contexts.
So here’s another way in which smartphones might transform the way we live and work: by offering insights into human psychology and behavior and, thus, supporting smarter social science.

T)What does the author say about the negative impact of smartphones? 
　A)It has been overshadowed by the positive impact.
E)It has more often than not been taken for granted.
F)It is not so obvious but has caused some concern.
G)It is subtle but should by no means be overstated.

U)What is considered a less obvious advantage of smartphone technology? 
　A)It systematically records real human interactions.
E)It helps people benefit from technological advances.
F)It brings people into closer contact with each other.
G)It greatly improves research on human behavior. 

　53.What characterizes traditional psychological research?
E)It is based on huge amounts of carefully collected data.
F)It relies on lab observations and participants’ reports.
G)It makes use of the questionnaire method.
H)It is often expensive and time-consuming.

E)How will future psychological studies benefit individuals? 
　A)By helping them pin down their unusual behaviors.
B)By helping them maintain a positive state of mind.
C)By helping them live their lives in a unique way.
D)By helping them cope with abnormal situations.

F)What do we learn about current psychological studies? 
　A)They are going through a period of painful transition.
E)They are increasingly focused on real-life situations.
F)They are conducted in a more rigorous manner.
G)They are mainly targeted towards undergraduates.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　Pasta is no longer off the menu, after a new review of studies suggested that the carbohydrate can form part of a healthy diet, and even help people lose weight. For years, nutritionists have recommended that pasta be kept to a 26, to cut calories, prevent fat build-up and stop blood sugar 27 up.
　　The low-carbohydrate food movement gave birth to such diets as the Atkins, Paleo and Keto, which advised swapping foods like bread, pasta and potatoes for vegetables, fish and meat. More recently the trend of swapping spaghetti for vegetables has been 28 by clean-eating experts.
　　But now a 29 review and analysis of 30 studies by Canadian researchers found that not only does pasta not cause weight gain, but three meals a week can help people drop more than half a kilogram over four months. The reviewers found that pasta had been unfairly demonized (妖魔化) because it had been 30 in with other, more ft-promoting carbohydrates.
　　“The study found that pasta didn’t 31 to weight gain or increase in body fat,” said lead author Dr. John Sievenpiper. “In 32 the evidence, we can now say with some confidence that pasta does not have an 33 effect on body weigh outcomes when it is consumed as part of a healthy dietary pattern.” In fact, analysis actually showed a small weigh loss 34 to concerns. Perhaps pasta can be part of a healthy diet.
　　Those involved in the 35 trials on average ate 3.3 servings of pasta a week instead of other carbohydrates, one serving equaling around half a cup. They lost around half a kilogram over an average follow-up of 12 weeks.
A) adverse	B) championed	C) clinical	D) contrary	E) contribute	F) intimate
G) lumped	H) magnified		I) minimum	J) radiating	K) ration	L) shooting
M) subscribe	N) systematic	O) weighing

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

The Best Retailers Combine Bricks and Clicks

A) Retail profits are falling sharply. Stores are closing. Malls are emptying. The depressing stories just keep coming. Reading the earnings announcements of large retail stores like Macy’s, Nordstrom, and Target is about as uplifting as a tour of an intensive care unit. The interact is apparently taking down yet another industry. Brick and mortar stores (实体店) seem to be going the way of the yellow pages. Sure enough, the Census Bureau just released data showing that online retail sales surged 15.2 percent between the first quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.

B) But before you dump all of your retail stocks, there are more facts you should consider. Looking only at that 15.2 percent “surge” would be misleading. It was an increase that was on a small base of 6.9 percent. Even when a tiny number grows by a large percentage terms, it is often still tiny.

C) More than 20 years after the internet was opened to commerce, the Census Bureau tells us that brick and mortar sales accounted for 92.3 percent of retail sales in the first quarter of 2016. Their data show that only 0.8 percent of retail sales shifted from offline to online between the beginning of 2015 and 2016.

D) So, despite all the talk about drone (无人机) deliveries to your doorstep, all the retail executives expressing anxiety over consumers going online, and even a Presidential candidate exclaiming that Amazon has a “huge antitrust problem,” the Census data suggest that physical retail is thriving. Of course, the closed stores, depressed executives, and sinking stocks suggest otherwise. What’s the real story?

E) Many firms operating brick and mortar stores are in trouble. The retail industry is getting reinvented, as we describe in our new book Matchmakers. It’s standing in the Path of what Schumpeter called a gale (大风) of creative destruction. That storm has been brewing for some time, and as it has reached gale force, most large retailers are searching for a response. As the CFO of Macy’s put it recently, “We’re frankly scratching our heads.”

F) But it’s not happening as experts predicted. In the peak of the dot. com bubble, brick and mortar retail was one of those industries the internet was going to kill-and quickly. The dot.com bust discredited most predictions of that sort and in the years that followed, conventional retailers’ confidence in the future increased as Census continued to report weak online sales. And then the gale hit.

G) It is becoming increasingly clear that retail reinvention isn’t a simple battle to the death between bricks and clicks. It is about devising retail models that work for people who are making increasing use of a growing array of internet-connected tools to change how they search, shop, and buy. Creative retailers are using the new technologies to innovate just about everything stores do from managing inventory, to marketing, to getting paid.

H) More than drones dropping a new supply of underwear on your doorstep, Apple’s massively successful brick-and-mortar-and-glass retail stores and Amazon’s small steps in the same direction are what should keep old-fashioned retailers awake at night. Not to mention the large number of creative new retailers, like Bonobos, that are blending online and offline experiences in creative ways.

I) Retail reinvention is not a simple process, and it’s also not happening on what used to be called “Internet Time.” Some internet-driven changes have happened quickly, of course. Craigslist quickly overtook newspaper classified ads and turned newspaper economics upside down. But many widely anticipated changes weren’t quick, and some haven’t really started. With the benefit of hindsight (后见之明), it looks like the interact will transform the economy at something like the pace of other great inventions like electricity. B2B commerce, for example, didn’t move mainly online by 2005 as many had predicted in 2000, nor even by 2016, but that doesn’t mean it won’t do so over the next few decades.

J) But the gale is still blowing. The sudden decline in foot traffic in recent years, even though it hasn’t been accompanied by a massive decline in physical sales, is a critical warning. People can shop more efficiently online and therefore don’t need to go to as many stores to find what they want. There’s a surplus of physical shopping space for the crowds, which is one reason why stores are downsizing and closing.

K) The rise of the mobile phone has recently added a new level of complexity to the process of retail reinvention. Even five years ago most people faced a choice. Sit at your computer, probably at home or at the office, search and browse, and buy. Or head out to the mall, or Main Street, look and shop, and buy. Now, just about everyone has a smartphone, connected to the internet almost everywhere almost all the time. Even when a retailer gets a customer to walk in the store, she can easily see if there’s a better deal online or at another store nearby.

L) So far, the main thing many large retailers have done in response to all this is to open online stores, so people will come to them directly rather than to Amazon and its smaller online rivals. Many are having the same problem that newspapers have. Even if they get online traffic, they struggle to make enough money online to compensate for what they are losing offline.

M) A few seem to be making this work. Among large traditional retailers, Walmart recently reported the best results, leading its stock price to surge, while Macy’s, Target, and Nordstrom’s dropped. Yet Walmart’s year-over-year online sales only grew 7 percent, leading its CEO to lament (哀叹), “Growth here is too slow.” Part of the problem is that almost two decades after Amazon filed the one. Click patent, the online retail shopping and buying experience is filled with frictions. A recent study graded more than 600 internet retailers on how easy it was for consumers to shop, buy, and pay. Almost half of the sites didn’t get a passing grade and only 18 percent got an A or B.

N) The turmoil on the ground in physical retail is hard to square with the Census data. Unfortunately, part of the explanation is that the Census retail data are unreliable. Our deep 100k into those data and their preparation revealed serious problems. It seems likely that Census simply misclassifies a large chunk of online sales. It is certain that the Census procedures, which lump the online sales of major traditional retailers like Walmart with “non-store retailers” 1ike food trucks can mask major changes in individual retail categories. The bureau could easily present their data in more useful ways. But they have chosen not to.

O) Despite the turmoil, brick and mortar won’t disappear any time soon. The big questions are which, if any, of the large traditional retailers will still be on the scene in a decade or two because they have successfully reinvented themselves, which new players will operate busy stores on Main Streets and maybe even in shopping malls, and how the shopping and buying experience will have changed in each retail category. Investors shouldn’t write off brick and mortar. Whether they should bet on the traditional players who run those stores now is another matter.

36. Although online retailing has existed for some twenty years, nearly half of the internet retailers still fail to receive satisfactory feedback from consumers, according to a recent survey.

37. Innovative retailers integrate internet technologies with conventional retailing to create new retail models.

38. Despite what the Census data suggest, the value of physical retail’s stocks has been dropping.

39. Innovative—driven changes in the retail industry didn’t take place as quickly as widely anticipated.

40. Statistics indicate that brick and mortar sales still made up the lion’s share of the retail business.

41. Companies that successfully combine online and offline business models may prove to be a big concern for traditional retailers.

42. Brick and mortar retailers’ faith in their business was strengthened when the dot com bubble burst.

43. Despite the tremendous challenges from online retailing, traditional retailing will be here to stay for quite some time.

44. With the rise of online commerce, physical retail stores are likely to suffer the same fate as the yellow pages.

45. The wide use of smartphones has made it more complex for traditional retailers to reinvent their business.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　Professor Stephen Hawking has warned that the creation of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) will be “either the best, or the worst thing, ever to happen to humanity”, and praised the creation of an academic institute dedicated to researching the future of intelligence as “ crucial to the future of our civilisation and our species”.
　　Hawking was speaking at the opening of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (LCFI) at Cambridge University, a multi-disciplinary institute that will attempt to tackle some of the open-ended questions raised by the rapid pace of development in AI research. “We spend a great deal of time study in history,” Hawking said, “which, let’s face it, is mostly the history of stupidity. So it’s a welcome change that people are studying instead the future of intelligence.”
　　While the world-renowned physicist has often been cautious about AI, raising concerns that humanity could be the architect of its own destruction if it creates a super-intelligence with a will of its own, he was also quick to highlight the positives that AI research can bring. “The potential benefits of creating intelligence are huge,” he said. “We cannot predict what we might achieve when our own minds are amplified by AI. Perhaps with the tools of this new technological revolution, we will be able to undo some of the damage done to the natural world by the last one —industrialisation. And surely we will aim to finally eradicate disease and poverty. And every aspect of our lives will be transformed. In short, success in creating AI could be the biggest event in the history of our civilisation.”
　　Huw Price, the centre’s academic director and the Bertrand Russell professor of philosophy at Cambridge University, where Hawking is also an academic, said that the centre came about partially as a result of the university’s Centre for Existential Risk. That institute examined a wider range of potential problems for humanity, while the LCFI has a narrow focus.
　　AI pioneer Margaret Boden, professor of cognitive science at the University of Sussex, praised the progress of such discussions. As recently as 2009, she said, the topic wasn’t taken seriously, even among AI researchers. “AI is hugely exciting,” she said, “but it has limitations, which present grave dangers given uncritical use.”
　　The academic community is not alone in warning about the potential dangers of AI as well as the potential benefits. A number of pioneers from the technology industry, most famously the entrepreneur Elon Musk, have also expressed their concerns about the damage that a super-intelligent AI could do to humanity.

46. What did Stephen Hawking think of artificial intelligence?
A) It would be vital to the progress of human civilisation.
B) It might be a blessing or a disaster in the making.
C) It might present challenges as well as opportunities.
D) It would be a significant expansion of human intelligence.

47. What did Hawking say about the creation of the LCFI?
A) It would accelerate the progress of AI research.
B) It would mark a step forward in the AI industry.
C) It was extremely important to the destiny of humankind.
D) It was an achievement of multi-disciplinary collaboration.

48. What did Hawking say was a welcome change in AI research?
A) The shift of research focus from the past to the future.
B) The shift of research from theory to implementation.
C) The greater emphasis on the negative impact of AI.
D) The increasing awareness of mankind’s past stupidity.

49. What concerns did Hawking raise about AI?
A) It may exceed human intelligence sooner or later.
B) It may ultimately over-amplify the human mind.
C) Super-intelligence may cause its own destruction.
D) Super-intelligence may eventually ruin mankind.

50. What do we learn about some entrepreneurs from the technology industry?
A) They are much influenced by the academic community.
B) They are most likely to benefit from AI development.
C) They share the same concerns about AI as academics.
D) They believe they can keep AI under human control.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　The market for products designed specifically for older adults could reach $30 billion by next year, and startups (初创公司) want in on the action. What they sometimes lack is feedback from the people who they hope will use their products. So Brookdale, the country’s largest owner of retirement communities, has been inviting a few select entrepreneurs just to move in for a few days, show off their products and hear what the residents have to say.
　　That’s what brought Dayle Rodriguez, 28, all the way from England to the dining room of Brookdale South Bay in Torrance, California. Rodriguez is the community and marketing manager for a company called Sentab. The startup’s product, SentabTV, enables older adults who may not be comfortable with computers to access email, video chat and social media using just their televisions and a remote control.
　　“It’s nothing new, it’s nothing too complicated and it’s natural because lots of people haveTV remotes,” says Rodriguez.
　　But none of that is the topic of conversation in the Brookdale dining room. Instead, Rodriguez solicits residents’ advice on what he should get on his cheeseburger and how he should spend the afternoon. Playing cards was on the agenda, as well as learning to play mahjong (麻将).
　　Rodriguez says it’s important that residents here don’t feel like he’s selling them something. “I’ve had more feedback in a passive approach,” he says. “Playing pool, playing cards, having dinner, having lunch,” all work better “than going through a survey of questions. When they get to know me and to trust me, knowing for sure I’m not selling them something—there’ll be more honest feedback from them.”
　　Rodriguez is just the seventh entrepreneur to move into one of Brookdale’s 1,100 senior living communities. Other new products in the program have included a kind of full-body blow dryer and specially designed clothing that allows people with disabilities to dress and undress themselves.
　　Mary Lou Busch, 93, agreed to try the Sentab system. She tells Rodriguez that it might be good for someone, but not for her. “I have the computer and FaceTime, which I talk with my family on, ”she explains. She also has an iPad and a smartphone. “So I do pretty much everything I need to do.”
　　To be fair, if Rodriguez had wanted feedback from some more technophobic (害怕技术的) seniors, he might have ended up in the wrong Brookdale community. This one is located in the heart of Southern California’s aerospace corridor. Many residents have backgrounds in engineering, business and academic circles.
　　But Rodriguez says he’s still learning something important by moving into this Brookdale community: “People are more tech-proficient than we thought.”
　　And besides, where else would he learn to play mahjong?

51. What does the passage say about the startups?
A) They never lose time in upgrading products for seniors.
B) They want to have a share of the seniors’ goods market.
C) They invite seniors to their companies to try their products.
D) They try to profit from promoting digital products to seniors.

52. Some entrepreneurs have been invited to Brookdale to
A) have an interview with potential customers
B) conduct a survey of retirement communities
C) collect residents’ feedback on their products
D) show senior residents how to use IT products

53. What do we know about SentabTV?
A) It is a TV program catering to the interest of the elderly.
B) It is a digital TV which enjoys popularity among seniors.
C) It is a TV specially designed for seniors to view programs.
D) It is a communication system via TV instead of a computer.

54. What does Rodriguez say is important in promoting products?
A) Winning trust from prospective customers.
B) Knowing the likes and dislikes of customers.
C) Demonstrating their superiority on the spot.
D) Responding promptly to customer feedback.

55. What do we learn about the seniors in the Brookdale community?
A) Most of them are interested in using the Sentab.
B) They are quite at ease with high-tech products.
C) They have much in common with seniors elsewhere.
D) Most of them enjoy a longer life than average people.

Part III         Reading Comprehension      (40 minutes)

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　The dream of personalised flight is still vivid in the minds of many inventors, some developing cycle-powered craft, others 26 money into jetpacks (喷气飞行背包). However, the flying car has always remained the 27 symbol of personal transport freedom.
　　Several companies around the world have produced 28 that can drive on roads and fly. Airbus has a futuristic modular (组件式的) concept involving a passenger capsule that can be 29 from the road-going chassis (底盘) and picked up by a helicopter-type machine.
　　But all these concepts are massively expensive, require safety certification standards for road and air, need 30 controls, involve complex folding wings and propellers, and have to be flown from air-strips. So they are likely to remain rich people’s playthings rather than practical transport solutions for the masses.
　　“A car that takes off from some London street and lands in another 31 street is unlikely to happen,” says Prof. Gray, a leading aeronautical engineer. “Sky taxis are much more likely.” But that won’t stop inventors from dreaming up new ways to fly and trying to persuade investors to back their sometimes 32 schemes.
　　Civilian aviation is being disrupted, not by the age-old desires for speed, romanticism and 33, but by the pressing need to respond to a changing climate. New electric engines coupled with artificial intelligence and 34 systems will contribute to a more efficient, integrated transport system that is less polluting and less noisy. That may sound simple, but as Prof. Gray says, “When I travel somewhere I like this notion that when I finish my journey I feel better than when I started it. That’s completely at 35 with how I feel today.” Now that would be progress.
A) autonomous	B) detached	C) dual	D) glamour	E) imminent	F) odds	G) opposites	H) outrageous
I) pouring	J) prototypes	K) random	L) repressing		M) segmented		N) spectrum	O) ultimate

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Companies Are Working with Consumers to Reduce Waste
A) As consumers, we are very wasteful. Annually, the world generates 1.3 billion tons of solid waste. This is expected to go up to 2.2 billion by 2025. The developed countries are responsible for 44% of waste, and in the U.S. alone, the average person throws away their body weight in rubbish every month.

B) Conventional wisdom would seem to suggest that companies have no incentive to lengthen the life cycle of their products and reduce the revenue they would get from selling new goods. Yet, more and more businesses are thinking about how to reduce consumer waste. This is partly driven by the rising price of raw materials and metals. It is also partly due to both consumers and companies becoming more aware of the need to protect our environment.

C) When choosing what products to buy and which brands to buy from, more and more consumers are looking into sustainability. This is opposed to just price and performance they were concerned about in the past. In a survey of 54 of the world’s leading brands, almost all of them reported that consumers are showing increasing care about sustainable lifestyles. At the same time, surveys on consumers in the U.S. and the U.K. show that they also care about minimizing energy use and reducing waste.

D) For the most part, consumers control what happens to a product. But some companies are realizing that placing the burden of recycling entirely on the consumer is not an effective strategy, especially when tossing something away seems like the easiest and most convenient option.

E) Some retailers and manufacturers in the clothing, footwear, and electronics industries have launched environmental programs. They want to make their customers interested in preserving their products and preventing things that still have value from going to the garbage dump. By offering services to help expand the longevity of their products, they’re promising quality and durability to consumers, and receiving the reputational gains for being environmentally friendly.

F) For example, the Swedish jeans company Nudie Jeans offers free repair at twenty of their shops. Instead of discarding their old worn-out jeans, customers bring them in to be renewed. The company even provides mail-order repair kits and online videos, so that customers can learn how to fix a pair of jeans at home. Their philosophy is that extending the life of a pair of jeans is not only great for the environment, but allows the consumer to get more value out of their product. When customers do want to toss their pair, they can give them back to the store, which will repurpose and resell them. Another clothing company, Patagonia, a high-end outdoor clothing store, follows the same principle. It has partnered with DIY website iFixit to teach consumers how to repair their clothing, such as waterproof outerwear, at home. The company also offers a repair program for their customers for a modest fee. Currently, Patagonia repairs about 40,000 garments a year in their Reno, Nevada, service center. According to the company’s CEO, Rose Marcario, this is about building a company that cares about the environment. At the same time, offering repair supports the perceived quality of its products.

G) In Brazil, the multinational corporation Adidas has been running a shoe-recycling program called “Sustainable Footprint” since 2012. Customers can bring shoes of any brand into an Adidas store to be shredded and turned into alternative fuels for energy creation instead of being burned as trash. They are used to fuel cement ovens. To motivate visitors to bring in more old shoes, Adidas Brazil promotes the program in stores by showing videos to educate customers, and it even offers a discount each time a customer brings in an old pair of shoes. This boosts the reputation and image of Adidas by making people more aware of the company’s values.

H) Enormous opportunities also lie with e-waste. It is estimated that in 2014 the world produced some 42 million metric tons of e-waste (discarded electrical and electronic equipment and its parts) with North America and Europe accounting for 8 and 12 million metric tons respectively. The materials from e-waste include iron, copper, gold, silver, and aluminum materials that could be reused, resold, salvaged, or recycled. Together, the value of these metals is estimated to be about $52 billion. Electronics giants like Best Buy and Samsung have provided e-waste take-back programs over the past few years, which aim to refurbish (翻新) old electronic components and parts into new products.

I) For other companies interested in reducing waste, helping the environment, and providing the sustainable lifestyles that consumers seek, here are some first steps for building a relationship with customers that focuses on recycling and restoring value to products.

J) Find partners. If you are a manufacturer who relies on outside distributors, then retailers are the ideal partner for collecting old products. Power tool maker DeWalt partners with companies, such as Lowes and Napa Auto Parts, to collect old tools at their stores for recycling. The partnership benefits both sides by allowing unconventional partners (for example, two companies from two different industries) to work together on a specific aspect of the value chain, like, in this example, an engine firm with an accessory one.

K) Create incentives. Environmental conscientiousness isn’t always enough to make customers recycle old goods. For instance, DeWalt discovered that many contractors were holding on to their old tools, even if they no longer worked, because they were expensive purchases and it was hard to justify bringing them in to recycle. By offering instant discounts worth as much as $100, DeWalt launched a trade-in program to encourage people to bring back tools. As a result, DeWalt now reuses those materials to create new products.

L) Start with a trial program, and expect to change the details as you go. Any take-back program will likely change over time, depending on what works for your customers and company goals. Maybe you see low customer participation at first, or conversely, so much success that the cost of recycling becomes too high. Best Buy, for instance, has been bearing the lion’s share of e-waste volume since two of its largest competitors, Amazon and Wal-mart, do not have their own recycling programs. Since the launch of its program, Best Buy changed its policy to add a $25 fee for recycling old televisions in order to keep the program going.

M) Build a culture of collective values with customers. A stronger relationship between the retailer/producer and the consumer isn’t just about financial incentives. By creating more awareness around your efforts to reduce waste, and by developing a culture of responsibility, repair, and reuse, you can build customer loyalty based on shared values and responsibilities.

N) These examples are just the tip of the iceberg, but they demonstrate how helping customers get more use of their materials can transform value chains and operations. Reducing waste by incorporating used materials into production can cut costs and decrease the price of procurement (采购): less to be procured from the outside and more to be re-utilized from the inside.

O) Companies play a big role in creating a circular economy, in which value is generating less from extracting new resources and more from getting better use out of the resources we already have--but they must also get customers engaged in the process.

36. Some companies believe that products’ prolonged lifespan benefits both the environment and customers.

37. A survey shows shoppers today are getting more concerned about energy conservation and environmental protection when deciding what to buy.

38. Companies can build customer loyalty by creating a positive culture of environmental awareness.

39. When companies launch environmental programs, they will have their brand reputation enhanced.

40. One multinational company offers discounts to customers who bring in old footwear to be used as fuel.

41. Recycling used products can help manufacturers reduce production costs.

42. Electronic products contain valuable metals that could be recovered.

43. It seems commonly believed that companies are not motivated to prolong their products’ lifespan.

44. It is advisable for companies to partner with each other in product recycling.

45. Some businesses have begun to realize it may not be effective to let consumers take full responsibility for recycling.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　Effective Friday, Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has declared a strike against 11 video game publishers over games that went into production after Feb. 17, 2015. The companies include some of the heavyweights of the industry, like Electronic Arts Productions, Insomniac Games, Activision and Disney.
　　The strike comes in light of an unsuccessful 19 months of negotiations after the existing labor contract known as the Interactive Media Agreement expired in late 2014. overall, the strike is an effort to provide more secondary compensation along with other concerns, such as transparency upon hiring talent and on-set (制作中) safety precautions.
　　The video gaming industry has ballooned in recent years. The Los Angeles Times reports that the industry is in the midst of an intense increase in cash flow. In 2015, gaming produced $23.5 billion in domestic revenue.
　　But SAG-AFTRA says voice actors don’t receive residuals (追加酬金) for their gaming work. Instead, they receive a fixed rate, which is typically about $825 for a standard four-hour vocal session. So the voice actors are pushing for the idea of secondary compensation—a performance bonus every time a game sells 2 million copies or downloads, or reaches 2 million subscribers, with a cap at 8 million.
　　“It’s a very small number of games that would trigger this secondary compensation issue,”said voice actor Crispin Freeman, who’s a member of the union’s negotiating committee. “This is an important aspect of what it means to be a freelance (从事自由职业的) performer, who isn’t regularly employed every single day working on projects.”
　　Another major complaint from the actors is the secrecy of the industry. “I can’t imagine if there’s any other acting job in the world where you don’t know what show you’re in, when you’re hired,” says voice actor Keythe Farley, who chairs the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee.
　　“And yet that happens every day in the video game world,” Farley told reporters during a press conference Friday. “I was a main character in Fallout 4, a character by the name of Kellogg, and I never knew that I was doing vocal recording for that game throughout the year and a half.”
　　Scott Witlin, the lawyer representing the video game companies, says voice actors “represent less than one tenth of 1 percent of the work that goes into making a video game.” So “even though they’re the top craftsmen in their field,” Witlin says, “if we pay them under a vastly different system than the people who do the 99.9 percent of the work, that’s going to create far more problems for the video game companies.”

46. Why did SAG-AFTRA declare a strike against some video game publishers?
A) The labor contract between them had been violated.
B) Its appeal to renegotiate the contract had been rejected.
C) It had been cheated repeatedly in the 19 months of talks.
D) The negotiations between them had broken down.

47. What do we learn from the passage about the video gaming industry?
A) It has reaped huge profits in recent years.
B) It has become more open and transparent.
C) It has attracted many famous voice actors.
D) It has invested a lot in its domestic market.

48. What are the voice actors demanding?
A) More regular employment.
B) A non-discriminatory contract.
C) Extra pay based on sales revenues.
D) A limit on the maximum work hours.

49. What does Keythe Farley say about voice actors?
A) They are kept in the dark about many details of their job.
B) They are discriminated against in the gaming industry.
C) They are not paid on a regular basis.
D) They are not employed full-time.

50. What is the argument of lawyer Scott Witlin?
A) Voice actors should have a pay raise if they prove to be top craftsmen.
B) Changing the pay system would cause the industry more problems.
C) Voice actors are mere craftsmen, not professional performers.
D) Paying voice actors on an hourly basis is in line with the law.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　Officials at the White House announced a new space policy focused on managing the increasing number of satellites that companies and governments are launching into space. Space Policy Directive-3 lays out general guidelines for the United States to mitigate (缓解) the effects of space debris and track and manage traffic in space.
　　This policy sets the stage for the Department of Commerce to take over the management of traffic in space. The department will make sure that newly launched satellites don’t use radio frequencies that would interfere with existing satellites, and schedule when such new satellites can be launched. This only applies to American space activities, but the hope is that it will help standardize a set of norms in the dawning commercial spaceflight industry throughout the world.
　　Space, especially the space directly around our planet, is getting more crowded as more governments and companies launch satellites. One impetus for the policy is that companies are already starting to build massive constellations ( 星 座 ), comprising hundreds or thousands of satellites with many moving parts among them. With so much stuff in space, and a limited area around our planet, the government wants to reduce the chances of a collision. Two or more satellites slamming into each other could create many more out-of-control bits that would pose even more hazards to the growing collection of satellites in space.
　　And it’s not like this hasn’t happened before. In 2009 an old Russian craft slammed into a communications satellite, creating a cloud of hundreds of pieces of debris and putting other hardware at risk. Journalist Sarah Scoles reports that NASA currently tracks about 24,000 objects in space, and in 2016 the Air Force had to issue 3,995,874 warnings to satellite owners alerting them to a potential nearby threat from another satellite or bit of debris.
　　That’s why this new policy also includes directions to update the current U.S. Government Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices, which already require any entity that launches a satellite or spacecraft to vigorously analyze the likelihood that any of their actions, from an unexpected failure or normal operations, will create more space debris. It includes accounting for any piece of debris they plan to release over 5mm that might stay in orbit for 25 years or more. It might seem surprising to think about an item staying in space for that long, but the oldest satellite still in orbit-Vanguard 1-turned 60 in 2018.
　　Agencies and companies throughout the world are working on developing technology that would dispose of or capture space debris before it causes serious damage. But for now, the U.S. government is more focused on preventing new debris from forming than taking the trash out of orbit.

51. What is the purpose of the new U.S. space policy?
A) To lay out general guidelines for space exploration.
B) To encourage companies to join in space programs.
C) To make the best use of satellites in space.
D) To improve traffic conditions in space.

52. What is the Department of Commerce expected to do under the new policy?
A) Reduce debris in space.
B) Monitor satellite operations.
C) Regulate the launching of new satellites.
D) Update satellite communications technology.

53. What does the U.S. government hope to do with the new space policy?
A) Set international standards for the space flight industry.
B) Monopolize space industry by developing a set of norms.
C) Facilitate commercial space flights throughout the world.
D) Promote international collaboration in space exploration.

54. What is a space vehicle launching entity required to do according to the current U.S.
Government Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices?
A) Give an estimate of how long its debris will stay in space.
B) Account for the debris it has released into space at any time.
C) Provide a detailed plan for managing the space debris it creates.
D) Make a thorough analysis of any possible addition to space debris.

55. What are space agencies and companies aiming to do at present?
A) Recycle used space vehicles before they turn into debris.
B) Develop technology to address the space debris problem.
C) Limit the amount of debris entering space.
D) Cooperate closely to retrieve space debris.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　Steel is valued for its reliability, but not when it gets cold. Most forms of steel 26 become brittle (脆的) at temperatures below about -25℃ unless they are mixed with other metals. Now, though, a novel type of steel has been developed that resists 27 at much lower temperatures, while retaining its strength and toughness—without the need for expensive 28.
　　Steel’s fragility at low temperatures first became a major concern during the Second World War. After German U-boats torpedoed (用鱼雷攻击) numerous British ships, a 2700-strong fleet of cheap-and-cheerful “Liberty ships” was introduced to replace the lost vessels, providing a lifeline for the 29 British. But the steel shells of hundreds of the ships 30 in the icy north Atlantic, and 12 broke in half and sank.
　　Brittleness remains a problem when building steel structures in cold conditions, such as oil rigs in the Arctic. So scientists have 31 to find a solution by mixing it with expensive metals such as nickel.
　　Yuuji Kimura and colleagues in Japan tried a more physical 32. Rather than adding other metals, they developed a complex mechanical process involving repeated heating and very severe mechanical deformation, known as temp forming.
　　The resulting steel appears to achieve a combination of strength and toughness that is 33 to that of modem steels that are very rich in alloy content and, therefore, very expensive.
　　Kimura’s team intends to use its tempformed steel to make ultra-high strength parts, such as bolts. They hope to reduce both the number of 34 needed in a construction job and their weight—by replacing solid supports with 35 tubes, for example. This could reduce the amount of steel needed to make everything from automobiles to buildings and bridges.
A) abruptly	B) additives	C) approach	D) ardently	E) besieged	F) channel	G) comparable
H) components	I) cracked	J) fractures	K) hollow	L) relevant	M) reshuffled	N) strived
O) violent

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
The future of personal satellite technology is here—are we ready for it?
A) Satellites used to be the exclusive playthings of rich governments and wealthy corporations. But increasingly, as space becomes more democratized, they are coming within reach of ordinary people. Just like drones (无人机) before them, miniature satellites are beginning to fundamentally transform our conceptions of who gets to do what up above our heads.

B) As a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences highlights, these satellites hold tremendous potential for making satellite-based science more accessible than ever before. However, as the cost of getting your own satellite in orbit drops sharply, the risks of irresponsible use grow. The question here is no longer “Can we?” but “Should we?” What are the potential downsides of having a slice of space densely populated by equipment built by people not traditionally labeled as “professionals”? And what would the responsible and beneficial development and use of this technology actually look like? Some of the answers may come from a nonprofit organization that has been building and launching amateur satellites for nearly 50 years.

C) Having your personal satellite launched into orbit might sound like an idea straight out of science fiction. But over the past few decades a unique class of satellites has been created that fits the bill: CubeSats. The “Cube” here simply refers to the satellite’s shape. The most common CubeSat is a 10cm cube, so small that a single CubeSat could easily be mistaken for a paperweight on your desk. These mini-satellites can fit in a launch vehicle’s formerly “wasted space.” Multiples can be deployed in combination for more complex missions than could be achieved by one CubeSat alone.

D) Within their compact bodies these minute satellites are able to house sensors and communications receivers/transmitters that enable operators to study Earth from space, as well as space around Earth. They're primarily designed for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) - an easily accessible region of space from around 200 to 800 miles above Earth, where human-tended missions like the Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station (ISS) hang out. But they can attain more distant orbits; NASA plans for most of its future Earth-escaping payloads (to the moon and
Mars especially) to carry CubeSats.

E) Because they’re so small and light, it costs much less to get a CubeSat into Earth’s orbit than a traditional communications or GPS satellite. For instance, a research group here at Arizona State University recently claimed their developmental small CubeSats could cost as little as $3,000 to put in orbit. This decrease in cost a11ows researchers, hobbyists and even elementary school groups to put simple instruments into LEO or even having them deployed from the ISS.

F) The first CubeSat was created in the early 2000s, as a way of enabling Stanford graduate students to design, build, test and operate a spacecraft with similar capabilities to the USSR’s Sputnik (前苏联的人造卫星). Since then, NASA, the National Reconnaissance Office and even Boeing have all launched and operated CubeSats. There are more than 130 currently in operation. The NASA Educational Launch of Nano Satellite program, which offers free launches for educational groups and science missions, is now open to U.S. nonprofit corporations as well. Clearly, satellites are not just for rocket scientists anymore.

G) The National Academy of Sciences report emphasizes CubeSats’ importance in scientific discovery and the training of future space scientists and engineers. Yet it also acknowledges that widespread deployment of LEO CubeSats isn’t risk-flee. The greatest concern the authors raise is space debris - pieces of “junk” that orbit the earth, with the potential to cause serious damage if they collide with operational units, including the ISS.

H) Currently, there aren’t many CubeSats and they’re tracked closely. Yet as LEO opens up to more amateur satellites, they may pose an increasing threat. As the report authors point out, even near-misses might lead to the “creation of a burdensome regulatory framework and affect the future disposition of science CubeSats.”

I) CubeSat researchers suggest that now’s the time to ponder unexpected and unintended possible consequences of more people than ever having access to their own small slice of space. In an era when you can simply buy a CubeSat kit off the shelf, how can we trust the satellites over our heads were developed with good intentions by people who knew what they were doing? Some “expert amateurs” in the satellite game could provide some inspiration for how to proceed responsibly.

J) In 1969, the Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation (AMSAT) was created in order to foster ham radio enthusiasts’ (业余无线电爱好者) participation in space research and communication. It continued the efforts, begun in 1961, by Project OSCAR- a U.S.-based group that built and launched the very first nongovernmental satellite just four years after Sputnik. As an organization of volunteers, AMSAT was putting “amateur” satellites in orbit decades before the current CubeSat craze. And over time, its members have learned a thing or two about responsibility. Here, open. source development has been a central principle, Within the organization, AMSAT has a philosophy of open sourcing everything making technical data on all aspects of their satellites fully available to everyone in the organization, and when possible, the public. According to a member of the team responsible for FOX 1-A, AMSAT’s first CubeSat, this means that there’s no way to sneak something like explosives or an energy emitter into an amateur satellite when everyone has access to the designs and implementation.

K) However, they’re more cautious about sharing information with nonmembers, as the organization guards against others developing the ability to hijack and take control of their satellites. This form of “self-governance” is possible within long-standing amateur organizations that, over time, are able to build a sense of responsibility to community members, as well as society in general. But what happens when new players emerge, who don’t have deep roots within the existing culture?

L) Hobbyists and students are gaining access to technologies without being part of a long-standing amateur establishment. They’re still constrained by funders, launch providers and a series of regulations - all of which rein in what CubeSat developers can and cannot do. But there’s a danger they’re ill-equipped to think through potential unintended consequences. What these unintended consequences might be is admittedly far from clear. Yet we know innovators can be remarkably creative with taking technologies in unexpected directions. Think of something as seemingly benign as the cellphone - we have microfinance and text-based social networking at one end of the spectrum, and improvised (临时制作的) explosive devices at the other.

M) This is where a culture of social responsibility around CubeSats becomes important – not simply to ensure that physical risks are minimized, but to engage with a much larger community in anticipating and managing less obvious consequences of the technology. This is not an easy task. Yet the evidence from AMSAT and other areas of technology development suggests that responsible amateur communities can and do emerge around novel technologies. The challenge here, of course, is ensuring that what an amateur communities considers to be responsible, actually is. Here’s where there needs to be a much wider public conversation that extends beyond government agencies and scientific communities to include students, hobbyists, and anyone who may potentially stand to be affected by the use of CubeSat technology.

36. Given the easier accessibility to space, it is time to think about how to prevent misuse of satellites.

37. A group of mini-satellites can work together to accomplish more complex tasks.

38. The greater accessibility of mini-satellites increases the risks of their irresponsible use.

39. Even school pupils can have their CubeSats put in orbit owing to the lowered launching cost.

40. AMSAT is careful about sharing information with outsiders to prevent hijacking of their satellites.

41. NASA offers to launch CubeSats free of charge for educational and research purposes.

42. Even with constraints, it is possible for some creative developers to take the CubeSat technology in directions that result in harmful outcomes.

43. While making significant contributions to space science, CubeSats may pose hazards to other space vehicles.

44. Mini-satellites enable operators to study Earth from LEO and space around it.

45. AMSAT operates on the principle of having all its technical data accessible to its members, preventing the abuse of amateur satellites.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　When I re-entered the full-time workforce a few years ago after a decade of solitary self-employment, there was one thing I was looking forward to the most: the opportunity to have work friends once again. It wasn’t until I entered the corporate world that I realized, for me at least, being friends with colleagues didn’t emerge as a priority at all. This is surprising when you consider the prevailing emphasis by scholars and trainers and managers on the importance of cultivating close interpersonal relationships at work. So much research has explored the way in which collegial ( 同 事 的 ) ties can help overcome a range of workplace issues affecting productivity and the quality of work output such as team-based conflict, jealousy, undermining, anger, and more.
　　Perhaps my expectations of lunches, water-cooler gossip and caring, deep-and-meaningful conversations were a legacy of the last time I was in that kind of office environment. Whereas now, as I near the end of my fourth decade, I realize work can be fully functional and entirely fulfilling without needing to be best mates with the people sitting next to you.
　　In an academic analysis just published in the profoundly-respected Journal of Management, researchers have looked at the concept of “indifferent relationships”. It’s a simple term that encapsulates (概括) the fact that relationships at work can reasonably be non-intimate, inconsequential, unimportant and even, dare I say it, disposable or substitutable.
　　Indifferent relationships are neither positive nor negative. The limited research conducted thus far indicates they’re especially dominant among those who value independence over cooperation, and harmony over confrontation. Indifference is also the preferred option among those who are socially lazy. Maintaining relationships over the long term takes effort. For some of us, too much effort.
　　As noted above, indifferent relationships may not always be the most helpful approach in resolving some of the issues that pop up at work. But there are nonetheless several empirically proven benefits. One of those is efficiency. Less time chatting and socializing means more time working and churning (产出).
　　The other is self-esteem. As human beings, we’re primed to compare ourselves to each other in what is an anxiety-inducing phenomenon. Apparently, we look down on acquaintances more so than friends. Since the former is most common among those inclined towards indifferent relationships, their predominance can bolster individuals’ sense of self-worth.
　　Ego aside, a third advantage is that the emotional neutrality of indifferent relationships has been found to enhance critical evaluation, to strengthen one’s focus on task resolution, and to gain greater access to valuable information. None of that might be as fun as after-work socializing but, hey, I’ll take it anyway.

46. What did the author realize when he re-entered the corporate world?
A) Making new friends with his workmates was not as easy as he had anticipated.
B) Cultivating positive interpersonal relationships helped him expel solitary feelings.
C) Working in the corporate world requires more interpersonal skills than self-employment.
D) Building close relationships with his colleagues was not as important as he had expected.

47. What do we learn from many studies about collegial relationships?
A) Inharmonious relationships have an adverse effect on productivity.
B) Harmonious relationships are what many companies aim to cultivate.
C) Close collegial relationships contribute very little to product quality.
D) Conflicting relationships in the workplace exist almost everywhere.

48. What can be inferred about relationships at work from an academic analysis?
A) They should be cultivated.
B) They are virtually irrelevant.
C) They are vital to corporate culture.
D) They should be reasonably intimate.

49. What does the author say about people who are socially lazy?
A) They feel Uncomfortable when engaging in social interactions.
B) They often find themselves in confrontation with their colleagues.
C) They are Unwilling to make efforts to maintain Workplace relationships.
D) They lack basic communication skills in dealing with interpersonal issues.

50. What is one of the benefits of indifferent relationships?
A) They provide fun at Work.
B) They help control emotions.
C) They help resolve differences.
D) They improve Work efficiency.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　In a few decades, artificial intelligence (AI) will surpass many of the abilities that we believe make us special. This is a grand challenge for our age and it may require an “irrational” response.
　　One of the most significant pieces of news from the US in early 2017 was the efforts of Google to make autonomous driving a reality. According to a report, Google’s self-driving cars clocked 1,023,330 km, and required human intervention 124 times. That is one intervention about every 8,047 km of autonomous driving. But even more impressive is the progress in just a single year: human interventions fell from 0.8 times per thousand miles to 0.2, a 400% improvement. With such progress, Google’s cars will easily surpass my own driving ability later this year.
　　Driving once seemed to be a very human skill. But we said that about chess, too. Then a computer beat the human world champion, repeatedly. The board game Go (围棋) took over from chess as a new test for human thinking in 2016, when a computer beat one of the world’s leading professional Go players. With computers conquering what used to be deeply human tasks, what will it mean in the future to be human? I worry about my six-year-old son. What will his place be in a world where machines beat us in one area after another? He’ll never calculate faster, never drive better, or even fly more safely. Actually, it all comes down to a fairly simple question: What’s so special about us? It can’t be skills like arithmetic, which machines already excel in. So far, machines have a pretty hard time emulating creativity, arbitrary enough not to be predicted by a computer, and yet more than simple randomness.
　　Perhaps, if we continue to improve information-processing machines, we’ll soon have helpful rational assistants. So we must aim to complement the rationality of the machine, rather than to compete with it. If I'm right, we should foster a creative spirit because a dose of illogical creativity will complement the rationality of the machine. Unfortunately, however, our education system has not caught up to the approaching reality. Indeed, our schools and universities are structured to mould pupils to be mostly obedient servants of rationality, and to develop outdated skills in interacting with outdated machines. We need to help our children learn how to best work with smart computers to improve human decision-making. But most of all we need to keep the long-term perspective in mind: that even if computers will outsmart us, we can still be the most creative. Because if we aren’t, we won’t be providing much value in future ecosystems, and that may put in question the foundation for our existence.

51. What is the author’s greatest concern about the use of AI?
A) Computers are performing lots of creative tasks.
B) Many abilities will cease to be unique to human beings.
C) Computers may become more rational than humans.
D) Many human skills are fast becoming outdated.

52. What impresses the author most in the field of AI?
A) Google’s experimental driverless cars require little human intervention.
B) Google’s cars have surpassed his driving ability in just a single year.
C) Google has made huge progress in autonomous driving in a short time.
D) Google has become a world leader in the field of autonomous driving.

53. What do we learn from the passage about creativity?
A) It is rational.
B) It is predictable.
C) It is human specific.
D) It is yet to be emulated by AI.

54. What should schools help children do in the era of AI?
A) Cultivate original thinking.
B) Learn to work independently.
C) Compete with smart machines.
D) Understand how AI works.

55. How can we humans justify our future existence?
A) By constantly outsmarting computers.
B) By adopting a long-term perspective.
C) By rationally compromising with AI.
D) By providing value with our creativity.

Part III         Reading Comprehension      (40 minutes)

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　When considering risk factors associated with serious chronic diseases, we often think about health indicators such as cholesterol, blood pressure, and body weight. But poor diet and physical inactivity also each increase the risk of heart disease and have a role to play in the development of some cancers. Perhaps worse, the 26 effects of an unhealthy diet and insufficient exercise are not limited to your body. Recent research has also shown that 27 in a high-fat and high-sugar diet may have negative effects on your brain, causing learning and memory 28.
　　Studies have found obesity is associated with impairments in cognitive functioning, as 29 by a range of learning and memory tests, such as the ability to remember a list of words presented some minutes or hours earlier. There is also a growing body of evidence that diet-induced cognitive impairments can emerge 30—within weeks or even days. For example, one study found healthy adults 31 to a high-fat diet for five days showed impaired attention, memory, and mood compared with a low-fat diet control group. Another study also found eating a high-fat and highsugar breakfast each day for as little as four days resulted in problems with learning and memory 32 to those observed in overweight and obese individuals.
　　Body weight was not hugely different between the groups eating a healthy diet and those on high fat and sugar diets. So this shows negative 33 of poor dietary intake can occur even when body weight has not changed 34. Thus, body weight is not always the best indicator of health and a thin person still needs to eat well and exercise 35.


Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Increased Screen Time and Wellbeing Decline in Youth
A) Have young people never had it so good? Or do they face more challenges than any previous generation? Our current era in the West is one of high wealth. This means minors enjoy material benefits and legal protections that would have been the envy of those living in the past. But there is an increasing suspicion that all is not well for our youth. And one of the most popular explanations, among some experts and the popular media, is that excessive & quote; screen time & quote; is to blame. (This refers to all the attention young people devote to their phones, tablets and laptops.) However, this is a contentious theory and such claims have been treated skeptically by some scholars based on their reading of the relevant data.

B) Now a new study has provided another contribution to the debate, uncovering strong evidence that adolescent wellbeing in the United States really is experiencing a decline and arguing that the most likely cause is the electronic riches we have given them. The background to this is that from the 1960s into the early 2000s, measures of average wellbeing went up in the US. This was especially true for younger people. It reflected the fact that these decades saw a climb in general standards of living and avoidance of mass societal traumas like full-scale war or economic deprivation. However, the & quote; screen time & quote; hypothesis, advanced by researchers such as Jean Twenge, is that electronic devices and excessive time spent online may have reversed these trends in recent years, causing problems for young people's psychological health.

C) To investigate, Twenge and her colleagues dived into the & quote; Monitoring the Future & quot; dataset based on annual surveys of American school students from grades 8, 10, and 12 that started in 1991. In total, 1.1 million young people answered various questions related to their wellbeing. Twenge’s team’s analysis of the answers confirmed the earlier, well-established wellbeing climb, with scores rising across the 1990s, and into the later 2000s. This was found across measures like self-esteem, life satisfaction, happiness and satisfaction with individual domains like job, neighborhood, or friends. But around 2012 these measures started to decline. This continued through 2016, the most recent year for which data is available.

D) Twenge and her colleagues wanted to understand why this change in average wellbeing occurred. However, it is very hard to demonstrate causes using non-experimental data such as this. In fact, when Twenge previously used this data to suggest a screen time effect, some commentators were quick to raise this problem. They argued that her causal-sounding claims rested on correlational data, and that she had not adequately accounted for other potential causal factors. This time around, Twenge and her team make a point of saying that they are not trying to establish causes as such, but that they are assessing the plausibility of potential causes.

E) First, they explain that if a given variable is playing a role in affecting wellbeing, then we should expect any change in that variable to correlate with the observed changes in wellbeing. If not, it is not plausible that the variable is a causal factor. So the researchers looked at time spent in a number of activities that could plausibly be driving the wellbeing decline. Less sport, and fewer meetings with peers correlated with lower wellbeing, as did less time reading print media(newspapers) and, surprisingly, less time doing homework .(This last finding would appear to contradict another popular hypothesis that it is our burdening of students with assignments that is causing all the problems.) In addition, more TV watching and more electronic communication both correlated with lower wellbeing. All these effects held true for measures of happiness, life satisfaction and self-esteem, with the effects stronger in the 8th and 10th-graders.

F) Next, Twenge’s team dug a little deeper into the data on screen time. They found that adolescents who spent a very small amount of time on digital devices—a couple of hours a week—had the highest wellbeing. Their wellbeing was even higher than those who never used such devices. However, higher doses of screen time were clearly associated with lower happiness. Those spending 10-19 hours per week on their devices were 41 percent more likely to be unhappy than lower-frequency users. Those who used such devices 40 hours a week or more (one in ten teenagers) were twice as likely to be unhappy. The data was slightly complicated by the fact that there was a tendency for kids who were social in the real world to also use more online communication, but by bracketing out different cases it became clear that the real-world sociality component correlated with greater wellbeing, whereas greater time on screens or online only correlated with poorer wellbeing.

G) So far, so plausible. But the next question is, are the drops in average wellbeing happening at the same time strands toward increased electronic device usage? It looks like it-after all, 2012 was the tipping point when more than half of Americans began owning smartphones. Twenge and her colleagues also found that across the key years of 2013-16, wellbeing was indeed lowest in years where adolescents spent more time online, on social media, and reading news online, and when more youth in the United States had smartphones. And in a second analysis, they found that where technology went, dips in wellbeing followed. For instance, years with a larger increase in online usage were followed by years with lower wellbeing, rather than the other way around. This does not prove causality, but is consistent with it. Meanwhile, TV use did not show this tracking. TV might make you less happy, but this is not what seems to be driving the recent declines in young people's average happiness.

H) A similar but reversed pattern was found for the activities associated with greater wellbeing. For example, years when people spent more time with friends were better years for wellbeing (and followed by better years). Sadly, the data also showed face-to-face socializing and sports activity had declined over the period covered by the survey.

I) There is another explanation that Twenge and her colleagues wanted to address: the impact of the the great recession of 2007-2009, which hit a great number of American families and might be affecting adolescents. The dataset they used did not include economic data, so instead the researchers looked at whether the 2013-16 wellbeing decline was tracking economic indicators. They found some evidence that some crude measures, like income inequality, correlated with changes in wellbeing, but economic measures with a more direct impact, like family income and unemployment rates (which put families into difficulties), had no relationship with wellbeing. The researchers also note that the recession hit some years before we see the beginning of the wellbeing drop, and before the steepest wellbeing decline, which occurred in 2013.

J) The researchers conclude that electronic communication was the only adolescent activity that increased at the same time psychological wellbeing declined. I suspect that some experts in the field will be keen to address alternative explanations, such as unassessed variables playing a role in the wellbeing decline. But the new work does go further than previous research and suggests that screen time should still be considered a potential barrier to young people’s flourishing.

36. The year when most Americans began using smartphones was identified as a turning point in young Americans' level of happiness.

37. Scores in various wellbeing measures began to go downward among young Americans in recent years.

38. Unfortunately, activities involving direct contact with people, which contributed to better wellbeing, were found to be on the decline.

39. In response to past critics, Twenge and her co-researchers stress they are not trying to prove that the use of digital devices reduces young people’s wellbeing.

40. In the last few decades of the 20th century, living standards went up and economic depressions were largely averted in the US.

41. Contrary to popular belief, doing homework might add to students’ wellbeing.

42. The author believes the researchers’ new study has gone a step further regarding the impact of screen time on wellbeing.

43. The researchers found that extended screen time makes young people less happy.

44. Data reveals that economic inequality rather than family income might affect people’s wellbeing.

45. Too much screen time is widely believed to be the cause of unhappiness among today’s young people.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D).

　　“The dangerous thing about lying is people don't understand how the act changes us.” says Dan Ariely behavioural psychologist at Duke University. Psychologists have documented children lying as early as the age of two. Some experts even consider lying a developmental milestone, like crawling and walking, because it requires sophisticated planning, attention and the ability to see a situation from someone else’s perspective to manipulate then. But, for most people, lying gets limited as we develop a sense of morality and the ability to self-regulate.
　　Harvard cognitive neuroscientist Joshua Greene says, for most of us, lying takes work. In studies, he gave subjects a chance to deceive for monetary gain while examining their brains in a functional MRI machine, which maps blood flow to active parts of the brain. Some people told the truth instantly and instinctively. But others opted to lie, and they showed increased activity in their frontal parietal (颅腔壁的) control network, which is involved in difficult or complex thinking. This suggests that they were deciding between truth and dishonesty—and ultimately opting for the letter. For a follow-up analysis, he found that people whose neural (神经的) reward centers were more active when they won money were also more likely to be among the group of liars – suggesting that lying may have to do with the inability to resist temptation.
　　External conditions also matter in terms of when and how often we lie. We are more likely to lie, when we are able to rationalise it, when we are stressed and fatigued or see others being dishonest. And we are less likely to lie when we have moral reminders or when we think others are watching. “We as a society need to understand that, when we don’t punish lying, we increase the probability it will happen again.” Ariely says.
　　In a 2016 study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, Ariely and colleagues showed how dishonesty alters people’s brains, making it easier to tell ties in the future. When people uttered a falsehood, the scientists notice a burst of activity in their amygdala. The amygdala is crucial part of the brain that produces fear, anxiety and emotional responses— including that sinking, guilty feeling you get when you lie. But when scientists had their subjects play a game in which they won money by deceiving their partner, they noticed the negative signals from the amygdala began to decrease. Not only that, but when people faced no consequences for dishonesty, their falsehood tended to get even more sensational. This means that if you give people multiple opportunities to lie for their own benefit, they start with little lies which get bigger over time.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　Here’s how the Pacific Northwest is preparing for “The Big One”. It’s the mother of all disaster drills for what could be the worst disaster in American history. California has spent years preparing for “The Big One”—the inevitable earthquake that will undoubtedly unleash all kinds of havoc along the famous San Andreas fault (断层). But what if the fault that runs along the Pacific Northwest delivers a gigantic earthquake of its own? If the people of the Cascadia region have anything to do with it, they won’t be caught unawares.
　　The region is engaged in a multi-day earthquake-and-tsunami (海啸) drill involving around 20,000 people. The Cascadia Rising drill gives area residents and emergency responders a chance to practice what to do in case of a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami along one of the nation’s dangerous—and underestimated—faults.
　　The Cascadia Earthquake Zone is big enough to compete with San Andreas (it’s been called the most dangerous fault in America), but it’s much lesser known than its California cousin. Nearly 700 miles long, the earthquake zone is located by the North American Plate off the coast of Pacific British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and Northern California.
　　Cascadia is what’s known as a “megathrust” fault. Megathrusts are created in earthquake zones—land plate boundaries where two plates converge. In the areas where one plate is beneath another, stress builds up over time. During a megathrust event, all of that stress releases and some of the world’s most powerful earthquakes occur. Remember the 9.1 earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean off Sumatra in 2004? It was caused by megathrust event as the India plate moved beneath the Burma micro-plate.
　　The last time a major earthquake occurred along the Cascadia fault was in 1700, so officials worry that another event could occur any time. To prevent that event from becoming a catastrophe, first responders will join members of the public in rehearsals that involve communication, evacuation, search and rescue, and other scenarios.
　　Thousands of casualties are expected if a 9.0 earthquake were to occur. Fist, the earthquake would shake metropolitan areas including Seattle and Portland. This could trigger a tsunami that would create havoc along the coast. Not all casualties can necessarily be prevented—but by coordinating across local, state, and even national borders, officials hope that the worst-case scenario can be averted. On the exercise’s website, officials explain that the report they prepare during this rehearsal will inform disaster management for years to come.
　　For hundreds of thousands of Cascadia residents. “The Big One” isn’t a question of if, only when. And it’s never too early to get ready for the inevitable.

51. What does “The Big One” refer to?
A) A gigantic geological fault. 
B) A large-scale exercise to prepare for disasters.
C) A massive natural catastrophe. 
D) A huge tsunami on the Caledonia coast.

52. What is the purpose of the Cascadia Rising drill?
A) To prepare people for a major earthquake and tsunami.
B) To increase residents’ awareness of imminent disasters.
C) To teach people how to adapt to post-disaster life.
D) To cope with the aftermath of a possible earthquake.

53. What happens in case of a megathrust earthquake according to the passage?
A) Two plates merge into one. 
B) A variety of forces converge.
C) Boundaries blur between plates. 
D) Enormous stress is released.

54. What do the officials hope to achieve through the drills?
A) Coordinating various disaster-relief efforts. 
B) Reducing casualties in the event of a disaster.
C) Minimizing property loss caused by disaster. 
D) Establishing disaster and emergency management.

55. What does the author say about “The Big One” ?
A) Whether it will occur remains to be seen. 
B) How it will arrive is too early to predict.
C) Its occurrence is just a matter of time. 
D) It keeps haunting Cascadia residents.

Part III                         Reading Comprehension                  (40 minutes)

Section A
Directions : In this section , there is a passage with ten blanks.  You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given  in  a word  bank following the passage.  Read the passage through carefully before making your choices.  Each choice in the bank is identified
　by a letter.  Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.   You  may not  use any  of the words  in the  bank more than once.

　　The United Nations issued a report last week warning that humans are destroying nature at such a rate that life  on  Earth  is  at  risk. When  the report  came  out,  it  naturally      26       headlines.  But obviously it didn,t hijack the news agenda in the manner of a major terrorist attack or    27     of war.

　　　The report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is clear on whatos at     28     and what needs to change. IPBES chair Robert Watson says the “    29     evidence ” presents an “ ominous ( 凶兆的) picture ” . “ The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is     30     more rapidly than ever, ” Robert Watson said. “ We are     31     the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.” The report says itos not too late if we make “ transformative change ” —fundamental, system-wide reorganization—at every level from local to  global , and we need to  focus  on how to make that happen.
　　First, donot indulge in despair, because despair leads to inertia and doing nothing means certain 	32     . Every action to  save nature will improve  our collective and personal futures and the only way to respond to a threat of this scale is with     33     action rooted in headstrong optimism. Second, we need relentless focus, just like when paramedics (救护人员) arrive on a scene and use the concept of “ triage (伤员鉴别分类) ” to ensure the most     34      cases  get  treated  first.  Saving the natural world needs that kind of thinking. We donot have the     35      to  do everything at once. We need to make hard choices.

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Children Understand Far More About Other Minds Than Long Believed

A) Until a few decades ago, scholars believed that young children know very little, if anything, about what others  are  thinking.  Swiss  psychologist  Jean  Piaget,  who  is  credited  with  founding  the scientific study of childrenos thinking, was convinced that preschool children cannot consider what goes on in the minds of others. The interviews and experiments he conducted with kids in the middle of the  20th  century   suggested  that  they  were  trapped  in  their   subjective  viewpoints,

incapable of imagining what others think, feel or believe.

B) Much of the subsequent research on early childhood thinking was highly influenced by Piaget,s ideas. Scholars  sought  to  refine  his  theory  and  empirically  confirm  his  views.  But  it  became increasingly clear that Piaget  seemed  to  have  gravely  underestimated  the  intellectual powers  of very young kids before they can make themselves understood by  speech. Researchers began to devise ever more ingenious ways of figuring out what goes on in the minds of babies, and the resulting picture of their abilities shows subtle variations. Consequently, the old view of children,s egocentric (自我中心的) nature and intellectual weaknesses has increasingly  fallen  out of favor and become replaced  by  a  more  generous  position  that  sees  a  budding  sense  not  only  of the physical world but also of other minds, even in the “ youngest young.”

C) Historically, children didn,t receive much respect for their mental powers. Piaget not only believed that children were “ egocentric ” in the sense that they were unable to differentiate between their own viewpoint and that of others; he was also convinced that their thinking was characterized by systematic errors and confusions. When playing with others, they don,t cooperate because they do not realize  there  are  different  roles  and  perspectives.  He  was  convinced  that  children  literally cannot “ get their act together ” : instead of playing cooperatively and truly together, they play side by side, with little regard for others. And when speaking with others, a young child supposedly cannot consider the listener,s viewpoint but “ talks to himself without listening to others. ”

D)  Piaget  and  his  followers  maintained  that  children  go  through  something  like  a  dark  age  of intellectual  development  before   slowly  and  gradually  becoming  enlightened  by  reason   and rationality as  they  reach  school  age.  Alongside  this  enlightenment  develops  an  ever  growing understanding of other persons, including their attitudes and views of the world.

E )   Today,  a  very   different   picture   of  children,s   mental   development   emerges.   Psychologists continually reveal  new  insights  into  the  depth  of  young  children,s  knowledge  of  the  world, including  their  understanding   of  other  minds.  Recent   studies   suggest  that  even  infants  are sensitive to others, perspectives and beliefs.

F) Part of the motivation to revise  some of Piaget,s conclusions  stemmed from an ideological shift about the origin  of human  knowledge  that  occurred  in  the  second  half  of the  20th  century.  It became increasingly unpopular to  assume  that  a  basic understanding  of the  world  can  be  built entirely from experience. This was in part prompted by theorist Noam Chomsky, who argued that something as complex as the rules of grammar cannot be picked up from exposure to speech, but is supplied by an inborn “ language faculty. ” Others followed suit and defined further “ core areas ” in which knowledge allegedly cannot be pieced together from experience but must be possessed at birth. One such area is our knowledge of others, minds. Some even argue that a basic knowledge of others, minds is not only possessed by human infants, but must be evolutionarily old and hence

shared by our nearest living relatives, the great apes.

G) To prove that infants know more in this realm than had been acknowledged, researchers needed to come up with innovative ways of showing it. A big part of why we now recognize so much more of kidso  intellectual  capacities  is  the  development  of  much  more  sensitive  research  tools  than Piaget had at his disposal.

H) Instead  of engaging  babies  in  dialog  or  having  them  execute  complex  motor  tasks,  the  newer methods capitalize  on  behaviors  that  have  a  firm  place  in  infantso  natural  behavior  repertoire: looking, listening, sucking, making  facial  expressions, gestures  and  simple manual  actions. The idea of focusing on these “ small behaviors ” is that they give kids the chance to demonstrate their knowledge implicitly and  spontaneously without having to respond to  questions or instructions. For example, children might look longer at an event that they did not expect to happen, or they might show  facial  expressions  indicating  that  they  have  sympathetic  concern  for  others.  When researchers measure  these  less  demanding,  and  often  involuntary,  behaviors,  they  can  detect  a sensitivity to otherso mental states at a much younger age than with the more taxing methods that Piaget and his followers deployed.

I) In the 1980s, these kinds of implicit measures became customary in developmental psychology. But it took a while longer before these tools were employed to measure childrenos grasp of the mental lives of others.

J)  In  a  set  of  experiments,  my  colleagues  at  the  University  of  Southern  California  and  I  found evidence  that  babies  can   even  anticipate  how  others  will  feel  when  their  expectations  are disappointed. We acted out several puppet (木偶) shows in front of two-year-old children. In these puppet shows, a protagonist (Cookie Monster) left his precious belongings (cookies) on stage and later returned to fetch them. What the protagonist did not know was that an antagonist had come and messed with his possessions. The children had witnessed these acts and attentively watched the protagonist return. We recorded  childrenos  facial  and  bodily  expressions.  Children  bit  their  lips, wrinkled their nose or wiggled (扭动) in their chair when the protagonist came back, as if they anticipated the bewilderment and disappointment he was about to experience. Importantly, children showed no such reactions and remained calm when the protagonist had seen the events himself and thus knew what to expect. Our study reveals that by the tender age of two, kids not only track what  others believe  or  expect;  they  can  even  foresee  how  others  will  feel  when  they  discover reality.

K) Studies like this reveal that there is much more going on in small kidso and even infantso minds than was previously believed. With  the  explicit  measures used by  Piaget  and  successors,  these deeper layers of kidso understanding cannot be accessed. The new investigative tools demonstrate that kids know more than they can say: when we scratch beneath the surface, we find an emerging

understanding of relations and perspectives that Piaget probably did not dream of.

L) Despite these obvious advances in the  study  of young  children,s thinking, it would be  a  grave mistake to dismiss the careful and systematic analyses compiled by Piaget and others before the new tests dominated the  scene because the  original methods revealed  essential  facts  about  how children think that the new methods cannot uncover.
M) There,s no consensus in today,s science community about how much we can infer from a look, a facial expression or a hand gesture. These behaviors clearly indicate a curiosity about what goes on in the mind of others, and probably a set of early intuitions coupled with a willingness to learn more. They pave the way to richer  and more  explicit forms  of understanding  of the minds  of others. But they  can  in  no  way  replace the  child,s  growing  ability  to  articulate  and  refine  her understanding of how people behave and why.

36. Piaget believed that small children could not collaborate with others while playing.

37. The author and his colleagues, study shows two-year-olds may be able to predict other people,s feelings.

38. In  the  latter  half  of  the   last  century,  fewer  and  fewer  people  believed  the  basis  for  our understanding of the world is wholly empirical.

39. Research conducted by Jean Piaget in the last century suggested babies were insensitive to others, thinking.

40. Our improved understanding of babies, intellectual power is attributable to better research tools.

41. It has been found in recent research that even small babies are sensitive to other people,s points of view.

42. Scientists are still debating what inference can be drawn from certain physical expressions of a child.
43.  The  newer  research  methods  focus  on  infants,  simple  behaviors  instead  of requiring  them  to answer questions.

44. With the progress in psychology, the traditional view of children,s self-centered nature and limited thinking abilities has become less and less influential.

45. Even  though  marked  advances  have  been  made,  it  is  wrong  to  dismiss  Piaget,s  fundamental contributions to the study of kids, cognitive abilities.

Section C
Directions : There  are  2  passages   in  this  section.    Each  passage  is followed   by  some  questions  or
　unfinished statements.  For each of them there are four choices marked A) , B) , C)  and D) .  You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　People often discuss the dangers of too much stress, but lately a very different view of stress is gaining popularity: this view of stress, held by members of the positive stress movement, argues that stress  might  actually  be  beneficial.  The  positive  stress  movement  is  made  up  of  people  such  as Zachary Rapp who  are  looking  for  an  edge  in  a  competitive  world, and Rapp,s routine  is  a  good example of followers of the movement. He wakes up most mornings at dawn, goes for a run, sips black  coffee  while  ripping  through  emails,  and  then  steps  into  a  freezing  cold  shower.  This  is  a routine  designed   to   reduce   the   stress   of   running   simultaneously   three   different   health    and biotechnology companies for 18 hours a day.
　　Although Rapp,s practices may  sound  extreme, he  is part of a  growing movement, consisting largely of tech  industry workers who  claim that  such radical tactics will help  them live better  and longer. Inspired by influential figures in different fields, including entertainers, athletes, entrepreneurs and  scientists,  positive   stress  practitioners   seek  out   some  combination  of  extreme  temperatures, restrictive diets, punishing exercise routines and general discomfort.
　　Rapp  argues  that  positive   stress  keeps  him  balanced.  In   addition  to  running  and  freezing showers, Rapp uses ice baths, hot yoga, and unconventional eating practices such as eliminating dairy, sugar, alcohol and various other foods high in carbohydrates. He believes that these practices, which put stress on his body, actually make him feel less stress from work. However, Rapp does not credit anyone in particular for his choices: he said he started using these methods in college, where he got into the habit of taking ice baths to recover from sports. He got back into it while trying to get his three companies off the ground.
　　Rapp works long hours and sleeps only five to seven hours a night but he said he only gets sick once a year. For him, the difference between day-to-day stress, like the kind we feel when moving apartments, and positive stress is that the latter involves pushing the body to extremes and forcing it to build up a tolerance.
　　　One thought leader in the positive stress world is Dutch extreme athlete Wim Hof, who earned the name  “ ice man ”  for his ability to withstand  severe cold using  deep breathing  exercises. Hof,s ideas have become popular among tech industry elites and, thanks to Hof, cold showers are now a trend; indeed, some even call it a form of therapy.
But it  is  important  to  note  that  not  everyone  agrees  with  these  practitioners;  indeed,  some

medical professionals  argue  that  positive   stress  is  not  for   everyone,  and  that  it  might   even  be dangerous for people who are unhealthy or older.

46. What do we learn about followers of the positive stress movement?
A) They are usually quite sensitive to different types of stress.
B) They hold a different view on stress from the popular one.
C) They derive much pleasure from living a very hectic life.
D) They gain a competitive edge by enjoying good health.

47. What do followers of the positive stress movement usually do to put their ideas into practice?
A) They keep changing their living habits.
B) They network with influential figures.
C) They seek jobs in tech industries.
D) They apply extreme tactics.

48. What does Zachary Rapp say about his unconventional practices?
A) They help him combat stress from work.
B) They enable him to cut down living expenses.
C) They enable him to recover from injuries and illnesses.
D) They help him get three companies enlisted all at once.

49. What can be inferred from the passage about day-to-day stress?
A) It is harmful to one,s physical and mental health.
B) It does not differ in essence from positive stress.
C) It is something everybody has to live with.
D) It does not help build up one,s tolerance.

50. What do some medical professionals think of positive stress?
A) Its true effect remains to be verified.
B) Its side effect should not be ignored.
C) Its effect varies considerably from person to person.
D) Its practitioners should not take it as a form of therapy.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Is hunting good or bad for the environment? Like so many hot button issues, the answer to this question depends upon who you ask. On the one hand, some say, nothing could be more natural than

　hunting, and indeed just about every animal species—including humans—has been either predator or prey  at some point in its evolution. And, ironic as it sounds, since humans have wiped out many animal predators, some see hunting as a natural way to reduce the herds of prey animals that now reproduce beyond the environment,s carrying capacity.
　　　On the other hand, many  environmental and animal advocates  see hunting  as  savage, arguing that it is morally wrong to kill animals, regardless of practical considerations. According to  Glenn Kirk of the California-based The Animals, Voice, hunting “ causes immense suffering to individual wild animals... ” and  is  “ irrationally  cruel  because  unlike  natural  predation  ( 捕 食) ,  hunters  kill   for pleasure... ” He adds that, despite hunters, claims that hunting keeps wildlife populations in balance, hunters, license fees are used to “ manipulate a few game species into overpopulation at the expense of a much  larger number of non-game  species, resulting in the loss of biological diversity, genetic integrity and ecological balance.”
　　Beyond moral  issues,  others  contend  that  hunting  is  not  practical.  According  to  the  Humane Society of the United States, the vast majority of hunted species—such as waterfowl, rabbits, upland birds and mourning doves— “ provide minimal nutrition and do not require population control. ”
　　Author Gary E. Varner suggests in his book, In Nature,s Interests, that some types of hunting may be morally justifiable while others may not be. Hunting “ designed to secure the aggregate welfare of the  target  species,  the  integrity  of  its   ecosystem,   or  both ”—what  Varner  terms   “ therapeutic hunting ” —is  defensible, while  subsistence  and  sport  hunting—both  of which  only  benefit  human beings—is not.
　　Regardless of one,s individual  stance, fewer Americans hunt today than in recent history. Data gathered by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service in 2006 show that only five percent of Americans— some 12.5 million individuals—consider themselves hunters today, down from nine percent in 2001 and 15 percent in 1996.
　　Public support for hunting, however, is on the rise. A 2007 survey by Responsive Management Inc. found that eighty percent of respondents agreed that  “ hunting has a legitimate place in modern society,” and the percentage of Americans indicating disapproval of hunting declined from 22 percent in 1995 to 16 percent in 2007.
　　Perhaps  matching   the  trend   among  the  public,  green  leaders  are  increasingly  advocating cooperation between  hunters  and  environmental  groups:  After  all,  both  deplore  urban  sprawl  and habitat destruction.

51. What does the author say sounds ironic?
A) Some predators may often turn out to be prey of other predators.
B) Hunting may also be a solution to the problem caused by hunting.
C) The species of prey animals continue to vary despite humans, hunting.
D) The number of prey animals keeps rising despite environmental change.

52. What does Glenn Kirk think of charging hunters license fees?
A) It keeps game population under control.
B) It turns hunting into a sport of the rich.
C) It leads to ecological imbalance.
D) It helps stop killing for pleasure.

53. What is the argument of the Humane Society of the United States against hunting?
A) Overpopulation is not an issue for most hunted animals.
B) Hunting deprives animal populations of their food sources.
C) Many birds and small animals are being irrationally killed.
D) Hunting is universally acknowledged as a savage behavior.

54. When is hunting morally justifiable according to Gary E. Varner?
A) When it benefits animals and their ecosystem.
B) When it serves both human and animal interests.
C) When it is indispensable to humans, subsistence.
D) When it stabilizes the population of animal species.

55. What concept are green leaders trying to promote?
A) Effective protection of animal habitats.
B) Strict control over urban development.
C) Coordinated efforts of hunters and environmentalists.
D) A compromise between development and animal protection.

Part III         Reading Comprehension      (40 minutes)

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　Overall, men are more likely than women to make excuses. Several studies suggest that men feel the need to appear competent in all 26, while women worry only about the skills in which they've invested 27. Ask a man and a woman to go diving for the first time, and the woman is likely to jump in, while the man is likely to say he's not feeling too well.
　　Ironically, it is often success that leads people to flirt with failure. Praise won for 28 a skill suddenly puts one in the position of having everything to lose. Rather than putting their reputation on the line again, many successful people develop a handicap—drinking, 29, depression—that allows them to keep their status no matter what the future brings. An advertising executive 30 for depression shortly after winning an award put it this way: “Without my depression, I’d be a failure now; with it, I’m a success ‘on hold.’”
　　In fact, the people most likely to become chronic excuse makers are those 31 with success. Such people are so afraid of being 32 a failure at anything that they constantly develop one handicap or another in order to explain away failure.
　　Though self-handicapping can be an effective way of coping with performance anxiety now and then, in the end, researchers say, it will lead to 33. In the long run, excuse makers fail to live up to their true 34 and lose the status they care so much about. And despite their protests to the 35， they have only themselves to blame.


Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Six Potential Brain Benefits of Bilingual Education
A) Brains, brains, brains. People are fascinated by brain research. And yet it can be hard to point to places where our education system is really making use of the latest neuroscience(神经科学) findings. But there is one happy link where research is meeting practice: bilingual(双语的) education. “In the last 20 years or so, there's been a virtual explosion of research on bilingualism,” says Judith Kroll, a professor at the University of California, Riverside.

B) Again and again, researchers have found, “bilingualism is an experience that shapes our brain for life,” in the words of Gigi Luk, an associate professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Education. At the same time, one of the hottest trends in public schooling is what’s often called dual-language or two-way immersion programs.

C) Traditional programs for English-language learners, or ELLs, focus on assimilating students into English as quickly as possible. Dual-language classrooms, by contrast, provide instruction across subjects to both English natives and English learners, in both English and a target language. The goal is functional bilingualism and biliteracy for all students by middle school. New York City, North Carolina, Delaware, Utah, Oregon and Washington state are among the places expanding dual-language classrooms.

D) The trend flies in the face of some of the culture wars of two decades ago, when advocates insisted on “English first” education. Most famously, California passed Proposition 227 in 1998. It was intended to sharply reduce the amount of tie that English-language learners spent in bilingual settings. Proposition 58, passed by California voters on November 8, largely reversed that decision, paving the way for a huge expansion of bilingual education in the state that has the largest population of English-language learners.

E) Some of the insistence on English-first was founded on research produced decades ago, in which bilingual students underperformed monolingual(单语的) English speakers and had lower IQ scores. Today’s scholars, like Ellen Bialystok at York University in Toronto, say that research was “deeply flawed.” “Earlier research looked at socially disadvantaged groups,” agrees Antonella Sorace at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. “This has been completely contradicted by recent research” that compares groups more similar to each other.

F) So what does recent research say about the potential benefits of bilingual education? It turns out that, in many ways, the real trick to speaking two languages consists in managing not to speak one of those languages at a given moment—which is fundamentally a feat of paying attention. Saying “Goodbye” to mom and then “Guten tag” to your teacher, or managing to ask for a crayola roja instead of a red crayon(蜡笔), requires skills called “inhibition” and “task switching.” These skills are subsets of an ability called executive function.

G) People who speak two languages often outperform monolinguals on general measures of executive function. “Bilinguals can pay focused attention without being distracted and also improve in the ability to switch from one task to another,” says Sorace.

H) Do these same advantages benefit a child who begins learning a second language in kindergarten instead of as a baby? We don't yet know. Patterns of language learning and language use are complex. But Gigi Luk at Harvard cites at least one brain-imaging study on adolescents that shows similar changes in brain structure when compared with those who are bilingual from birth, even when they didn't begin practicing a second language in earnest before late childhood.

I) Young children being raised bilingual have to follow social cues to figure out which language to use with which person and in what setting. As a result, says Sorace, bilingual children as young as age 3 have demonstrated a head start on tests of perspective-taking and theory of mind—both of which are fundamental social and emotional skills.

J) About 10 percent of students in the Portland, Oregon public schools are assigned by lottery to dual-language classrooms that offer instruction in Spanish, Japanese or Mandarin, alongside English. Jennifer Steele at American University conducted a four-year, randomized trial and found that the dual-language students outperformed their peers in English-reading skills by a full school-year’s worth of learning by the end of middle school. Because the effects are found in reading, not in math or science where there were few differences, Steele suggests that learning two languages make students more aware of how language works in general.

K) The research of Gigi Luk at Harvard offers a slightly different explanation. She has recently done a small study looking at a group of 100 fourth-graders in Massachusetts who had similar reading scores on a standard test, but very different language experiences. Some were foreign-language dominant and others were English natives. Here's what’s interesting. The students who were dominant in a foreign language weren't yet comfortably bilingual; they were just starting to learn English. Therefore, by definition, they had a much weaker English vocabulary than the native speakers. Yet they were just as good at interpreting a text. “This is very surprising,” Luk says. ”You would expect the reading comprehension performance to mirror the vocabulary—it’s a cornerstone of comprehension.”

L) How did the foreign-language dominant speakers manage this feat? Well, Luk found, they also scored higher on tests of executive functioning. So, even though they didn't have huge mental dictionaries to draw on, they may have been great puzzle-solvers, taking into account higher-level concepts such as whether a single sentence made sense within an overall storyline. They got to the same results as the monolinguals, by a different path.

M) American public school classrooms as a whole are becoming more segregated by race and class. Dual-language programs can be an exception. Because they are composed of native English speakers deliberately placed together with recent immigrants, they tend to be more ethnically and economically balanced. And there is some evidence that this helps kids of all backgrounds gain comfort with diversity and different cultures.

N) Several of the researchers also pointed out that, in bilingual education, non-English-dominant students and their families tend to feel that their home language is heard and valued, compared with a classroom where the home language is left at the door in favor of English. This can improve students' sense of belonging and increase parents' involvement in their children's education, including behaviors like reading to children. “Many parents fear their language is an obstacle, a problem, and if they abandon it their child will integrate better,” says Antonella Sorace of the University of Edinburgh. “We tell them they’re not doing their child a favor by giving up their language.”

O) One theme that was striking in speaking to all these researchers was just how strongly they advocated for dual-language classrooms. Thomas and Collier have advised many school systems on how to expand their dual language programs, and Sorace runs “bilingualism Matters,” an international network of researchers who promote bilingual education projects. This type of advocacy among scientists is unusual; even more so because the “bilingual advantage hypothesis” is being challenged once again.

P) A review of studies published last year found that cognitive advantages failed to appear in 83 percent of published studies, though in a separate analysis, the sum of effects was still significantly positive. One potential explanation offered by the researchers is that advantages that are measurable in the very young and very old tend to fade when testing young adults at the peak of their cognitive powers. And, they countered that no negative effects of bilingual education have been found. So, even if the advantages are small, they are still worth it. Not to mention one obvious, outstanding fact: “Bilingual children can speak two languages!”

36. A study found that there are similar changes in brain structure between those who are bilingual from birth and those who start learning a second language later. 

37. Unlike traditional monolingual programs, bilingual classrooms aim at developing students' ability to use two languages by middle school. 

38. A study showed that dual-language students did significantly better than their peers in reading English texts. 

39. About twenty years ago, bilingual practice was strongly discouraged, especially in California. 

40. Ethnically and economically balanced bilingual classrooms are found to be helpful for kids to get used to social and cultural diversity. 

41. Researchers now claim that earlier research on bilingual education was seriously flawed. 

42. According to a researcher, dual-language experiences exert a lifelong influence on one's brain. 

43. Advocates of bilingual education argued that it produces positive effects though they may be limited. 

44. Bilingual speakers often do better than monolinguals in completing certain tasks because they can concentrate better on what they are doing. 

45. When their native language is used, parents can become more involved in their children's education.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　It is not controversial to say that an unhealthy diet causes bad health. Nor are the basic elements of healthy eating disputed. Obesity raises susceptibility to cancer, and Britain is the sixth most obese country on Earth. That is a public health emergency. But naming the problem is the easy part. No one disputes the costs in quality of life and depleted health budgets of an obese population, but the quest for solutions gets diverted by ideological arguments around responsibility and choice. And the water is muddied by lobbying from the industries that profit from consumption of obesity-inducing products.
　　Historical precedent suggests that science and politics can overcome resistance from businesses that pollute and poison but it takes time, and success often starts small. So it is heartening to note that a programme in Leeds has achieved a reduction in childhood obesity, becoming the first UK city to reverse a fattening trend. The best results were among younger children and in more deprived areas. When 28% of English children aged two to 15 are obese, a national shift on the scale achieved by Leeds would lengthen hundreds of thousands of lives. A significant factor in the Leeds experience appears to be a scheme called HENRY, which helps parents reward behaviours that prevent obesity in children.
　　Many members of parliament are uncomfortable even with their own government's anti-obesity strategy, since it involves a “sugar tax” and abandon the sale of energy drinks to under-16s. Bans and taxes can be blunt instruments, but their harshest critics can rarely suggest better methods. These critics just oppose regulation itself.
　　The relationship between poor health and inequality is too pronounced for governments to be passive about large-scale intervention. People living in the most deprived areas are four times more prone to die from avoidable causes than counterparts in more affluent places. As the structural nature of public health problems becomes harder to ignore, the complaint about over protective government loses potency.
　　In fact, the polarised debate over public health interventions should have been abandoned long ago. Government action works when individuals are motivated to respond. Individuals need governments that expand access to good choices. The HENRY programme was delivered in part through children's centres. Closing such centres and cutting council budgets doesn’t magically increase reserves of individual self-reliance. The function of a well-designed state intervention is not to deprive people of liberty but to build social capacity and infrastructure that helps people take responsibility for their wellbeing. The obesity crisis will not have a solution devised by left or right ideology—but experience indicates that the private sector needs the incentive of regulation before it starts taking public health emergencies seriously.

46. Why is the obesity problem in Britain so difficult to solve?
A) Government health budgets are depleted.
B) People disagree as to who should do what.
C) Individuals are not ready to take their responsibilities.
D) Industry lobbying makes it hard to get healthy foods.

47. What can we learn from the past experience in tackling public health emergencies?
A) Governments have a role to play.
B) Public health is a scientific issue.
C) Priority should be given to deprived regions.
D) Businesses' responsibility should be stressed.

48. What does the author imply about some critics of bans and taxes concerning unhealthy drinks?
A) They are not aware of the consequences of obesity.
B) They have not come up with anything more constructive.
C) They are uncomfortable with parliament anti-obesity debate.
D) They have their own motives in opposing government regulation.

49. Why does the author stress the relationship between poor health and inequality?
A) To demonstrate the dilemma of people living in deprived areas.
B) To bring to light the root cause of widespread obesity in Britain.
C) To highlight the area deserving the most attention from the public.
D) To justify government intervention in solving the obesity problem.

50. When will government action be effective?
A) When the polarised debate is abandoned.
B) When ideological differences are resolved.
C) When individuals have the incentive to act accordingly.
D) When the private sector realises the severity of the crisis.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　Home to virgin reefs, rare sharks and vast numbers of exotic fish, the Coral Sea is a unique haven of biodiversity off the northeastern coast of Australia. If a proposal by the Australian government goes ahead, the region will also become the world's largest marine protected area, with restrictions or bans on fishing, mining and marine farming.
　　The Coral Sea reserve would cover almost 990 000 square kilometres and stretch as far as 1 100 kilometres from the coast. Unveiled recently by environment minister Tony Burke, the proposal would be the last in a series of proposed marine reserves around Australia's coast.
　　But the scheme is attracting criticism from scientists and conservation groups, who argue that the government hasn't gone far enough in protecting the Coral Sea, or in other marine reserves in the coastal network.
　　Hugh Possingham, director of the Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions at the University of Queensland, points out that little more than half of the Coral Sea reserve is proposed as “no take” area, in which all fishing would be banned. The world's largest existing marine reserve, established last year by the British government in the Indian Ocean, spans 554 000 km² and is a no-take zone throughout. An alliance of campaigning conversation groups argues that more of the Coral Sea should receive this level of protection.
　　“I would like to have seen more protection for coral reefs,” says Terry Hughes, director of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University in Queensland. “More than 20 of them would be outside the no-take area and vulnerable to catch-and-release fishing”.
　　As Nature went to press, the Australian government had not responded to specific criticisms of the plan. But Robin Beaman, a marine geologist at James Cook University, says that the reserve does “broadly protect the range of habitats” in the sea. “I can testify to the huge effort that government agencies and other organisations have put into trying to understand the ecological values of this vast area,” he says.
　　Reserves proposed earlier this year for Australia's southwestern and northwestern coastal regions have also been criticised for failing to give habitats adequate protection. In August, 173 marine scientists signed an open letter to the government saying they were “greatly concerned” that the proposals for the southwestern region had not been based on the “core science principles” of reserves—the protected regions were not, for instance, representative of all the habitats in the region, they said.
　　Critics say that the southwestern reserve offers the greatest protection to the offshore areas where commercial opportunities are fewest and where there is little threat to the environment, a contention also levelled at the Coral Sea plan.

51. What do we learn from the passage about the Coral Sea?
A) It is exceptionally rich in marine life.
B) It is the biggest marine protected area.
C) It remains largely undisturbed by humans.
D) It is a unique haven of endangered species.

52. What does the Australian government plan to do according to Tony Burke?
A) Make a new proposal to protect the Coral Sea.
B) Revise its conservation plan owing to criticisms.
C) Upgrade the established reserves to protect marine life.
D) Complete the series of marine reserves around its coast.

53. What is scientists' argument about the Coral Sea proposal?
A) The government has not done enough for marine protection.
B) It will not improve the marine reserves along Australia's coast.
C) The government has not consulted them in drawing up the proposal.
D) It is not based on sufficient investigations into the ecological system.

54. What does marine geologist Robin Beaman say about the Coral Sea plan?
A) It can compare with the British government's effort in the Indian Ocean.
B) It will result in the establishment of the world's largest marine reserve.
C) It will ensure the sustainability of the fishing industry around the coast.
D) It is a tremendous joint effort to protect the range of marine habitats.

55. What do critics think of the Coral Sea plan?
A) It will do more harm than good to the environment.
B) It will adversely affect Australia's fishing industry.
C) It will protect regions that actually require little protection.

Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　It was perhaps when my parents—who also happen to be my housemates—left to go travelling for a couple of months recently that it 26 on me why I had not yet left the family home.
　　It wasn't that I relied on them for 27 reasons, or to keep my life in order, or to ease the chaos of the home. These days, I rely on them for their company.
　　I missed coming home and talking about my day at work, and I missed being able to read their faces and sense how their day was. I missed having unique 28 into tiny details that make a life.
　　While the conversation about young adults staying longer at home is 29 by talk of laziness, of dependence, of an inability for young people to pull themselves together, 30 do we talk of the way, in my case at least, my relationship with my parents has 31 strengthened the longer we have lived together.
　　Over the years the power dynamic has changed and is no longer defined by one being the giver and another, the taker. So, what does this say for our relationships within the family home?
　　According to psychologist Sabina Read, there are “some very positive possible 32 when adult children share the family home”, noting the “parent-child relationship may indeed strengthen and mature” in the process.
　　But, she notes, a strong 33 doesn't simply come with time. “The many changing factors of the relationship need to be acknowledged, rather than hoping that the mere passage of time will 34 connect parents to their adult children. It's important to acknowledge that the relationship parameters have changed to avoid falling back into 35 from the teen years.

How Telemedicine Is Transforming Healthcare
A) After years of big promises, telemedicine is finally living up to its potential. Driven by faster internet connections, ubiquitous(无处不在的) smartphones and changing insurance standards, more health providers are turning to electronic communications to do their jobs—and it's dramatically changing the delivery of healthcare.

B) Doctors are linking up with patients by phone, email and webcam(网络摄像头) . They’re also consulting with each other electronically—sometimes to make split second decisions on heart attacks and strokes. Patients, meanwhile, are using new devices to relay their blood pressure, heart rate and other vital signs to their doctors so they can manage chronic conditions at home. Telemedicine also allows for better care in places where medical expertise is hard to come by. Five to 10 times a day, Doctors Without Borders relays questions about tough cases from its physicians in Niger, South Sudan and elsewhere to its network of 280 experts around the world, and back again via internet.

C) As a measure of how rapidly telemedicine is spreading, consider: More than 15 million Americans received some kind of medical care remotely last year, according to the American Telemedicine Association, a trade group, which expects those numbers to grow by 30% this year.

D) None of this is to say that telemedicine has found its way into all comers of medicine. A recent survey of 500 tech-savvy(精通技术的) consumers found that 39% hadn’t heard of telemedicine, and of those who haven’t used it, 42% said they preferred in-person doctor visits. In a poll of 1500 family physicians, only 15% had used it in their practices—but 90% said they would if it were appropriately reimbursed(补偿) .

E) What's more, for all the rapid growth, significant questions and challenges remain. Rules defining and regulating telemedicine differ widely from state to state. Physicians groups are issuing different guidelines about what care they consider appropriate to deliver and in what form.

F) Some critics also question whether the quality of care is keeping up with the rapid expansion of telemedicine. And there's the question of what services physicians should be paid for: Insurance coverage varies from health plan to health plan, and a big federal plan covers only a narrow range of services. Telemedicine's future will depend on how—and whether—regulators, providers, payers and patients can address these challenges. Here's a closer look at some of these issues:

G) Do patients trade quality for convenience? The fastest-growing services in telemedicine connect consumers with clinicians they've never met for a phone, video or email visit—on-demand, 24/7. Typically, these are for nonemergency issues such as colds, flu, ear-aches and skin rashes, and they cost around $45, compared with approximately $100 at a doctor's office, $160 at an urgent-care clinic or $750 and up at an emergency room.

H) Many health plans and employers have rushed to offer the services and promote them as a convenient way for plan members to get medical care without leaving home or work. Nearly three-quarters of large employers will offer virtual doctor visits as a benefit to employees this year, up from 48% last year. Web companies such as Tel a doc and American Well are expected to host some 1.2 million such virtual doctor visits this year, up 20% from last year, according to the American Telemedicine Association. 

I) But critics worry that such services maybe sacrificing quality for convenience. Consulting a random doctor patients will never meet, they say, further fragments the health-care system, and even minor issues such as upper respiratory(上呼吸道的) infections can’t be thoroughly evaluated by a doctor who can’t listen to your heart or feel your swollen glands. In a recent study, researchers posing as patients with skin problems sought help from 16 telemedicine sites—with unsettling results. In 62 encounters, fewer than one-third disclosed clinicians' credential or let patients choose; only 32% discussed potential side effects of prescribed medications. Several sites misdiagnosed serious conditions, largely because they failed to ask basic follow-up questions, the researchers said. “Telemedicine holds enormous promise, but these sites are just not ready for prime time,” says Jack Res neck, the study's lead author.

J) The American Telemedicine Association and other organizations have started accreditation(鉴定) programs to identify top-quality telemedicine sites. The American Medical Association this month approved new ethical guidelines for telemedicine, calling for participating doctors to recognize the limitations of such services and ensure that they have sufficient information to make clinical recommendations.

K) Who pays for the services? While employers and health plans have been eager to cover virtual urgent-care visits, insurers have been far less willing to pay for telemedicine when doctors use phone, email or video to consult with existing patients about continuing issues. “It's very hard to get paid unless you physically see the patient,” says Peter Rasmussen, medical director of distance health at the Cleveland Clinic. Some 32 states have passed “parity”(等同的) laws requiring private insurers to reimburse doctors for services delivered remotely if the same service would be covered in person, though not necessarily at the same rate or frequency. Medicare lags further behind. The federal health plan for the elderly covers a small number of telemedicine services—only for beneficiaries in rural areas and only when the services are received in a hospital, doctor's office or clinic.

L) Bills to expand Medicare coverage of telemedicine have bipartisan(两党的) support in Congress. Opponents worry that such expansion would be costly for taxpayers, but advocates say it would save money in the long run.

M) Experts say more hospitals are likely to invest in telemedicine systems as they move away from fee-for-service payments and into managed-care-type contracts that give them a set fee to provide care for patients and allow them to keep any savings they achieve.

N) Is the state-by-state regulatory system outdated? Historically, regulation of medicine has been left to individual states. But some industry members contend that having 50 different sets of rules, licensing fees and even definitions of “medical practice" makes less sense in the era of telemedicine and is hampering its growth. Currently, doctors must have a valid license in the state where the patient is located to provide medical care, which means virtual-visit companies can match users only with locally licensed clinicians. It also causes administrative hassles(麻烦) for world-class medical centers that attract patients from across the country. At the Mayo Clinic, doctors who treat out-of-state patients can follow up with them via phone, email or web chats when they return home, but they can only discuss the conditions they treated in person. “If the patient wants to talk about a new problem, the doctor has to be licensed in that state to discuss it. If not, the patient should talk to his primary-care physician about it,” says Steve Ommen, who runs Mayo's Connected Care program.

O) To date, 17 states have joined a compact that will allow a doctor licensed in one member state to quickly obtain a license in another. While welcoming the move, some telemedicine advocates would prefer states to automatically honor one another's licenses, as they do with drivers' licenses. But states aren’t likely to surrender control of medical practice, and most are considering new regulations. This year, more than 200 telemedicine-related bills have been introduced in 42 states, many regarding what services Medicaid will cover and whether payers should reimburse for remote patient monitoring. “A lot of states are still trying to define telemedicine,” says Lisa Robbin, chief advocacy officer for the Federation of State Medical Boards.

36. An overwhelming majority of family physicians are willing to use telemedicine if they are duly paid.

37. Many employers are eager to provide telemedicine service as a benefit to their employees because of its convenience.

38. Different states have markedly different regulations for telemedicine.

39. With telemedicine, patients in regions short of professional medical service are able to receive better medical care.

40. Unlike employers and health plans, insurers have been rather reluctant to pay for some telemedicine services.

41. Some supporters of telemedicine hope states will accept each other's medical practice licenses as valid.

42. The fastest growing area for telemedicine services is for lesser health problems.

43. As telemedicine spreads quickly, some of its opponents doubt whether its service quality can be guaranteed.

44. The results obtained by researchers who pretended to be patients seeking help from telemedicine providers are disturbing.

45. Some people argue that the fact that different states have different regulations concerning medical services hinders the development of telemedicine.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　Danielle Steel, the 71-year-old romance novelist is notoriously productive, having published 179 books at a rate of up to seven a year. But a passing reference in a recent profile by Glamour magazine to her 20-hour workdays prompted an outpouring of admiration.
　　Steel has given that 20-hour figure when describing her “exhausting” process in the past: “I start the book and don't leave my desk until the first draft is finished.” She goes from bed, to desk, to bath, to bed, avoiding all contact aside from phone calls with her nine children. “I don't comb my hair for weeks,” she says. Meals are brought to her desk, where she types until her fingers swell and her nails bleed.
The business news website Quartz held Steel up as an inspiration, writing that if only we all followed her “actually extremely liberating” example of industrious sleeplessness, we would be quick to see results.
　　Well, indeed. With research results showing the cumulative effects of sleep loss and its impact on productivity, doubt has been voiced about the accuracy of Steel’s self-assessment. Her output maybe undeniable, but sceptics have suggested that she is guilty of erasing the role of ghost writers(代笔人) at worst, gross exaggeration at best.
　　Steel says working 20 hours a day is “pretty brutal physically.” But is it even possible? “No,” says Maryanne Taylor of the Sleep Works. While you could work that long, the impact on productivity would make it hardly worthwhile. If Steel was routinely sleeping for four hours a night, she would be drastically underestimating the negative impact, says Alison Gardiner, founder of the sleep improvement programme Sleep station. “It’s akin to being drunk.”
　　It’s possible that Steel is exaggerating the demands of her schedule. Self-imposed sleeplessness has “become a bit of a status symbol”, says Taylor, a misguided measure to prove how powerful and productive you are. Margaret Thatcher was also said to get by on four hours a night, while the 130-hour workweeks endured by tech heads has been held up as key to their success.
　　That is starting to change with increased awareness of the importance of sleep for mental health. “People are starting to realise that sleep should not be something that you fit in between everything else,” says Taylor.
　　But it is possible—if statistically extremely unlikely—that Steel could be born a “short sleeper” with an unusual body clock, says sleep expert Dr. Sophie Bostock. “It’s probably present in fewer than 1% of the population.”
　　Even if Steel does happen to be among that tiny minority, says Bostock, it's “pretty irresponsible” to suggest that 20-hour days are simply a question of discipline for the rest of us.

46. What do we learn from the passage about Glamour magazine readers?
A) They are intrigued by the exotic romance in Danielle Steel's novels.
B) They are amazed by the number of books written by Danielle Steel.
C) They are deeply impressed by Danielle Steel's daily work schedule.
D) They are highly motivated by Danielle Steel’s unusual productivity.

47. What did the business news website Quartz say about Danielle Steel?
A) She could serve as an example of industriousness.
B) She proved we could liberate ourselves from sleep.
C) She could be an inspiration to novelists all over the world.
D) She showed we could get all our work done without sleep. 

48. What do sceptics think of Danielle Steel's work schedule claims?
A) They are questionable.
B) They are alterable.
C) They are irresistible.
D) They are verifiable.

49. What does Maryanne Taylor think of self-imposed sleeplessness?
A) It may turn out to be key to a successful career.
B) It may be practiced only by certain tech heads.
C) It may symbolise one's importance and success.
D) It may well serve as a measure of self-discipline.

50. How does Dr. Sophie Bostock look at the 20-hour daily work schedule?
A) One should not adopt it without consulting a sleep expert.
B) The general public should not be encouraged to follow it.
C) One must be duly self-disciplined to adhere to it.
D) The majority must adjust their body clock for it.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　
　　Organic agriculture is a relatively untapped resource for feeding the Earth's population, especially in the face of climate change and other global challenges. That's the conclusion I reached in reviewing 40 years of science comparing the long-term prospects of organic and conventional farming.
　　The review study, “Organic Agriculture in the 21st Century,” is featured as the cover story for the February issue of the journal Nature Plants. It is the first to compare organic and conventional agriculture across the main goals of sustainability identified by the National Academy of Sciences: productivity, economics, and environment.
　　Critics have long argued that organic agriculture is inefficient, requiring more land to yield the same amount of food. It's true that organic farming produces lower yields, averaging 10 to 20 percent less than conventional. Advocates contend that the environmental advantages of organic agriculture far outweigh the lower yields, and that increasing research and breeding resources for organic systems would reduce the yield gap. Sometimes excluded from these arguments is the fact that we already produce enough food to more than feed the world's 7.4 billion people but do not provide adequate access to all individuals.
　　In some cases, organic yields can be higher than conventional. For example, in severe drought conditions, which are expected to increase with climate change in many areas, organic farms can produce as good, if not better, yields because of the higher water-holding capacity of organically farmed soils.
What science does tell us is that mainstream conventional farming systems have provided growing supplies of food and other products but often at the expense of other sustainability goals.
　　Conventional agriculture may produce more food, but it often comes at a cost to the environment. Biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, and severe impacts on ecosystem services have not only accompanied conventional farming systems but have often extended well beyond their field boundaries. With organic agriculture, environmental costs tend to be lower and the benefits greater.
　　Overall, organic farms tend to store more soil carbon, have better soil quality, and reduce soil erosion compared to their conventional counterparts. Organic agriculture also creates less soil and water pollution and lower greenhouse gas emissions. And it’s more energy-efficient because it doesn't rely on synthetic fertilizers or pesticides.
　　Organic agriculture is also associated with greater biodiversity of plants, animals, insects and microorganisms as well as genetic diversity. Biodiversity increases the services that nature provides and improves the ability of farming systems to adapt to changing conditions.
　　Despite lower yields, organic agriculture is more profitable for farmers because consumers are willing to pay more. Higher prices, called price premiums, can be justified as a way to compensate farmers for providing ecosystem services and avoiding environmental damage or external costs.

51. What do we learn from the conclusion of the author's review study?
A) More resources should be tapped for feeding the world's population.
B) Organic farming may be exploited to solve the global food problem.
C) The long-term prospects of organic farming are yet to be explored.
D) Organic farming is at least as promising as conventional farming.

52. What is the critics' argument against organic farming?
A) It cannot meet the need for food.
B) It cannot increase farm yields.
C) It is not really practical.
D) It is not that productive.

53. What does the author think should be taken into account in arguing about organic farming?
A) Growth in world population.
B) Deterioration in soil fertility.
C) Inequality in food distribution.
D) Advance in farming technology.

54. What does science tell us about conventional farming?
A) It will not be able to meet global food demand.
B) It is not conducive to sustainable development.
C) It will eventually give away to organic farming. 
D) It is going mainstream throughout the world.

55. Why does the author think higher prices of organic farm produce are justifiable?
A) They give farmers going organic a big competitive edge.
B) They motivate farmers to upgrade farming technology.
C) Organic farming costs more than conventional farming.
D) Organic farming does long-term good to the ecosystem.

Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

　　　The idea of taxing things that are bad for society has a powerful allure. It offers the possibility of a double benefit—   26   harmful activities, while also providing the government with revenue.
　　　Take sin taxes. Taxes on alcohol make it more expensive to get drunk, which reduces excessive drinking and   27   driving. At the same time, they provide state and local governments with billions of dollars of revenue. Tobacco taxes, which generate more than twice as much, have proven   28   in the decline of smoking, which has saved millions of lives.
　　　Taxes can also be an important tool for environmental protection, and many economists say taxing carbon would be the best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Economic theory says that unlike income or sales taxes, carbon taxes can actually increase economic efficiency; because companies that __29 _ carbon dioxide into the sky don’t pay the costs of the climate change they cause, carbon taxes would restore the proper 30 to the market.
　　　In reality, carbon taxes alone won’t be enough to halt global warming, but they would be a useful part of any climate plan. What’s more, the revenue from this tax, which would   31   be hundreds of billions of dollars per year, could be handed out to citizens as a   32   or used to fund green infrastructure projects.
　　　Similarly, a wealth tax has been put forward as a way to reduce inequality while raising revenue. The revenue from this tax, which some experts   33   will be over $4 trillion per decade, would be designated for housing, child care, health care and other government benefits. If you believe, as many do, that wealth inequality is   34   bad, then these taxes improve society while also   35   government coffers (金库).

The Challenges for Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture

A) A group of corn farmers stands huddled around an agronomist (农学家)and his computer on the side of an irrigation machine in central South Africa. The agronomist has just flown over the field with a hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that takes off and lands using propellers yet maintains distance and speed for scanning vast hectares of land through the use of its fixed wings.

B) The UAV is fitted with a four spectral band precision sensor that conducts onboard processing immediately after the flight, allowing farmers and field staff to address, almost immediately, any crop abnormalities that the sensor may have recorded, making the data collection truly real-time.

C) In this instance, the farmers and agronomist are looking to specialized software to give them an accurate plant population count. It’s been 10 days since the corn emerged and the farmer wants to determine if there are any parts of the field that require replanting due to a lack of emergence or wind damage, which can be severe in the early stages of the summer rainy season.

D) At this growth stage of the plant’s development, the farmer has another 10 days to conduct any replanting before the majority of his fertilizer and chemical applications need to occur. Once these have been applied, it becomes economically unviable to take corrective action, making any further collected data historical and useful only to inform future practices for the season to come.

E) The software completes its processing in under 15 minutes producing a plant population count map. It’s difficult to grasp just how impressive this is, without understanding that just over a year ago it would have taken three to five days to process the exact same data set, illustrating the advancements that have been achieved in precision agriculture and remote sensing in recent years. With the software having been developed in the United States on the same variety of crops in seemingly similar conditions, the agronomist feels confident that the software will produce a near accurate result.

F) As the map appears on the screen, the agronomist’s face begins to drop. Having walked through the planted rows before the flight to gain a physical understanding of the situation on the ground, he knows the instant he sees the data on his screen that the plant count is not correct, and so do the farmers, even with their limited understanding of how to read remote sensing maps.

G) Hypothetically, it is possible for machines to learn to solve any problem on earth relating to the physical interaction of all things within a defined or contained environment by using artificial intelligence and machine learning.

H) Remote sensors enable algorithms (算法)to interpret a field’s environment as statistical data that can be understood and useful to farmers for decision-making. Algorithms process the data, adapting and learning based on the data received. The more inputs and statistical information collected, the better the algorithm will be at predicting a range of outcomes. And the aim is that farmers can use this artificial intelligence to achieve their goal of a better harvest through making better decisions in the field.

I) In 2011, IBM, through its R&D Headquarters in Haifa, Israel, launched an agricultural cloud-computing project. The project, in collaboration with a number of specialized IT and agricultural partners, had one goal in mind—to take a variety of academic and physical data sources from an agricultural environment and turn these into automatic predictive solutions for farmers that would assist them in making real-time decisions in the field.

J) Interviews with some of the IBM project team members at the time revealed that the team believed it was entirely possible to “algorithm” agriculture, meaning that algorithms could solve any problem in the world. Earlier that year, IBM’s cognitive learning system, Watson, competed in the game Jeopardy against former winners Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings with astonishing results. Several years later, Watson went on to produce ground-breaking achievements in the field of medicine.

K) So why did the project have such success in medicine but not agriculture? Because it is one of the most difficult fields to contain for the purpose of statistical quantification. Even within a single field, conditions are always changing from one section to the next. There’s unpredictable weather, changes in soil quality, and the ever-present possibility that pests and diseases may pay a visit. Growers may feel their prospects are good for an upcoming harvest, but until that day arrives, the outcome will always be uncertain.

L) By comparison, our bodies are a contained environment. Agriculture takes place in nature, among ecosystems of interacting organisms and activity, and crop production takes place within that ecosystem environment. But these ecosystems are not contained. They are subject to climatic occurrences such as weather systems, which impact upon hemispheres as a whole, and from continent to continent. Therefore, understanding how to manage an agricultural environment means taking literally many hundreds if not thousands of factors into account.

M) What may occur with the same seed and fertilizer program in the United States’ Midwest region is almost certainly unrelated to what may occur with the same seed and fertilizer program in Australia or South Africa. A few factors that could impact on variation would typically include the measurement of rain per unit of a crop planted, soil type, patterns of soil degradation, daylight hours, temperature and so forth.

N) So the problem with deploying machine learning and artificial intelligence in agriculture is not that scientists lack the capacity to develop programs and protocols to begin to address the biggest of growers’ concerns; the problem is that in most cases, no two environments will be exactly alike, which makes the testing, validation and successful rollout of such technologies much more laborious than in most other industries.

O) Practically, to say that AI and Machine Learning can be developed to solve all problems related to our physical environment is to basically say that we have a complete understanding of all aspects of the interaction of physical or material activity on the planet. After all, it is only through our understanding of “the nature of things” that protocols and processes are designed for the rational capabilities of cognitive systems to take place. And, although AI and Machine Learning are teaching us many things about how to understand our environment, we are still far from being able to predict critical outcomes in fields like agriculture purely through the cognitive ability of machines.

P) Backed by the venture capital community, which is now investing billions of dollars in the sector, most agricultural technology startups today are pushed to complete development as quickly as possible and then encouraged to flood the market as quickly as possible with their products.

Q) This usually results in a failure of a product, which leads to skepticism from the market and delivers a blow to the integrity of Machine Learning technology. In most cases, the problem is not that the technology does not work, the problem is that industry has not taken the time to respect that agriculture is one of the most uncontained environments to manage. For technology to truly make an impact on agriculture, more effort, skills, and funding is needed to test these technologies in farmers’ fields.

R) There is huge potential for artificial intelligence and machine learning to revolutionize agriculture by integrating these technologies into critical markets on a global scale. Only then can it make a difference to the grower, where it really counts.

36.	Farmers will not profit from replanting once they have applied most of the fertilizer and other chemicals to their fields.

37.	Agriculture differs from the medical science of the human body in that its environment is not a contained one.

38.	The agronomist is sure that he will obtain a near accurate count of plant population with his software.

39.	The application of artificial intelligence to agriculture is much more challenging than to most other industries.

40.	Even the farmers know the data provided by the UAV is not correct.

41.	The pressure for quick results leads to product failure, which, in turn, arouses doubts about the applicability of AI technology to agriculture.

42.	Remote sensors are aimed to help farmers improve decision-making to increase yields.

43.	The farmer expects the software to tell him whether he will have to replant any parts of his farm fields.

44.	Agriculture proves very difficult to quantify because of the constantly changing conditions involved.

45.	The same seed and fertilizer program may yield completely different outcomes in different places.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　　What is the place of art in a culture of inattention? Recent visitors to the Louvre report that tourists can now spend only a minute in front of the Mona Lisa before being asked to move on. Much of that time, for some of them, is spent taking photographs not even of the painting but of themselves with the painting in the background.
　　　One view is that we have democratised tourism and gallery-going so much that we have made it effectively impossible to appreciate what we’ve travelled to see. In this oversubscribed society, experience becomes a commodity like any other. There are queues to climb Mt. Jolmo Lungma as well as to see famous paintings. Leisure, thus conceived, is hard labour, and returning to work becomes a well-earned break from the ordeal.
　　　What gets lost in this industrialised haste is the quality of looking. Consider an extreme example, the late philosopher Richard Wollheim. When he visited the Louvre he could spent as much as four hours sitting before a painting. The first hour, he claimed, was necessary for misperceptions to be eliminated. It was only then that the picture would begin to disclose itself. This seems unthinkable today, but it is still possible to organise. Even in the busiest museums there are many rooms and many pictures worth hours of contemplation which the crowds largely ignore. Sometimes the largest crowds are partly the products of bad management; the Mona Lisa is such a hurried experience today partly because the museum is being reorganised. The Uffizi in Florence, another site of cultural pilgrimage, has cut its entry queues down to seven minutes by clever management. And there are some forms of art, those designed to be spectacles as well as objects of contemplation, which can work perfectly well in the face of huge crowds.
　　　Olafur Eliasson’s current Tate Modern show, for instance, might seem nothing more than an entertainment, overrun as it is with kids romping (喧闹地玩耍)in fog rooms and spray mist installations. But it’s more than that: where Eliasson is at his most entertaining, he is at his most serious too, and his disorienting installations bring home the reality of the destructive effects we are having on the    planet — not least what we are doing to the glaciers of Eliasson’s beloved Iceland.
　　　Marcel Proust, another lover of the Louvre, wrote: “ It is only through art that we can escape from ourselves and know how another person sees the universe, whose landscapes would otherwise have remained as unknown as any on the moon.”If any art remains worth seeing, it must lead us to such escapes. But a minute in front of a painting in a hurried crowd won’t do that.

46.	What does the scene at the Louvre demonstrate according to the author?
A)	The enormous appeal of a great piece of artistic work to tourists.
B)	The near impossibility of appreciating art in an age of mass tourism.
C)	The ever-growing commercial value of long-cherished artistic works.
D)	The real difficulty in getting a glimpse at a masterpiece amid a crowd.

47.	Why did the late philosopher Richard Wollheim spend four hours before a picture?
A)	It takes time to appreciate a piece of art fully.
B)	It is quite common to misinterpret artistic works.
C)	The longer people contemplate a picture, the more likely they will enjoy it.
D)	The more time one spends before a painting, the more valuable one finds it.

48.	What does the case of the Uffizi in Florence show?
A)	Art works in museums should be better taken care of.
B)	Sites of cultural pilgrimage are always flooded with visitors.
C)	Good management is key to handling large crowds of visitors.
D)	Large crowds of visitors cause management problems for museums.

49.	What do we learn from Olafur Eliasson’s current Tate Modern show?
A)	Children learn to appreciate art works most effectively while they are playing.
B)	It is possible to combine entertainment with appreciation of serious art.
C)	Art works about the environment appeal most to young children.
D)	Some forms of art can accommodate huge crowds of visitors.

50.	What can art do according to Marcel Proust?
A)	Enable us to live a much fuller life.
B)	Allow us to escape the harsh reality.
C)	Help us to see the world from a different perspective.
D)	Urge us to explore the unknown domain of the universe.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　　Every five years, the government tries to tell Americans what to put in their bellies. Eat more vegetables. Dial back the fats. It’s all based on the best available science for leading a healthy life. But the best available science also has a lot to say about what those food choices do to the environment, and some researchers are annoyed that new dietary recommendations of the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) released yesterday seem to utterly ignore that fact.
　　　Broadly, the 2016 - 2020 dietary recommendations aim for balance: More vegetables, leaner meats and far less sugar.
　　　But Americans consume more calories per capita than almost any other country in the world. So the things Americans eat have a huge impact on climate change. Soil tilling releases carbon dioxide, and delivery vehicles emit exhaust. The government’s dietary guidelines could have done a lot to lower that climate cost. Not just because of their position of authority: The guidelines drive billions of dollars of food production through federal programs like school lunches and nutrition assistance for the needy.
　　　On its own, plant and animal agriculture contributes 9 percent of all the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. That’s not counting the fuel burned in transportation, processing, refrigeration, and other waypoints between farm and belly. Red meats are among the biggest and most notorious emitters, but trucking a salad from California to Minnesota in January also carries a significant burden. And greenhouse gas emissions aren’t the whole story. Food production is the largest user of fresh water, largest contributor to the loss of biodiversity, and a major contributor to using up natural resources.
　　　All of these points and more showed up in the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee’s scientific report, released last February. Miriam Nelson chaired the subcommittee in charge of sustainability for the report, and is disappointed that eating less meat and buying local food aren’t in the final product. “Especially if you consider that eating less meat, especially red and processed, has health benefits,” she says.
　　　So what happened? The official response is that sustainability falls too far outside the guidelines’ official scope, which is to provide “nutritional and dietary information.”
　　　Possibly the agencies in charge of drafting the decisions are too close to the industries they are supposed to regulate. On one hand, the USDA is compiling dietary advice. On the other, their clients are US agriculture companies.
　　　The line about keeping the guidelines’ scope to nutrition and diet doesn’t ring quite right with researchers. David Wallinga, for example, says, “ In previous guidelines, they’ve always been concerned with things like food security — which is presumably the mission of the USDA. You absolutely need to be worried about climate impacts and future sustainability if you want secure food in the future.”

51. Why are some researchers irritated at the USDA's 2016-2020 Dietary Guidelines?
A) It ignores the harmful effect of red meat and processed food on health.
B) Too much emphasis is given to eating less meat and buying local food.
C) The dietary recommendations are not based on medical science.
D) It takes no notice of the potential impact on the environment.

52.	Why does the author say the USDA could have contributed a lot to lowering the climate cost through its dietary guidelines?
A)	It has the capacity and the financial resources to do so.
B)	Its researchers have already submitted relevant proposals.
C)	Its agencies in charge of drafting the guidelines have the expertise.
D)	It can raise students’ environmental awareness through its programs.

53.	What do we learn from the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee’s scientific report?
A)	Food is easily contaminated from farm to belly.
B)	Greenhouse effect is an issue still under debate.
C)	Modern agriculture has increased food diversity.
D)	Farming consumes most of our natural resources.

54.	What may account for the neglect of sustainability in the USDA’s Dietary Guidelines according to the author?
A)	Its exclusive concern with Americans’ food safety.
B)	Its sole responsibility for providing dietary advice.
C)	Its close ties with the agriculture companies.
D)	Its alleged failure to regulate the industries.

55.	What should the USDA do to achieve food security according to David Wallinga?
A)	Give top priority to things like nutrition and food security.
B)	Endeavor to ensure the sustainable development of agriculture.
C)	Fulfill its mission by closely cooperating with the industries.
D)	Study the long-term impact of climate change on food production.

Part III          Reading Comprehension                  (40 minutes)

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

　　　Virtually every activity that entails or facilitates in-person human interaction seems to be in the midst of a total meltdown as the coronavirus (冠状病毒)outbreak erases Americans’ desire to travel. Amtrak says bookings are down 50 percent and cancelations are up 300 percent. Hotels in San Francisco are experiencing   26   rates between 70 and 80 percent. Broadway goes dark on Thursday night. Universities, now emptying their campuses, have never tried online learning on this   27 _. White-collar companies like Amazon, Apple, and the New York Times are asking employees to work from home for the   28   future.
　　　But what happens after the coronavirus?
　　　In some ways, the answer is: All the old normal stuff. The pandemic(大流行病)will take      lives,   29   economies and destroy routines, but it will pass. Americans will never stop going to basketball games. They won’t stop going on vacation. They’ll meet to do business. No decentralizing technology so far — not telephones, not television, and not the internet — has dented that human desire to shake hands, despite technologists’   30   to the contrary.
　　　Yet there are real reasons to think that things will not return to the way they were last week.  Small   31   create small societal shifts; big ones change things for good. The New York transit strike of 1980 is   32   with prompting several long-term changes in the city, including bus and bike lanes, and women wearing sports shoes to work. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 prompted the development of national health care in Europe.
　　　Here and now, this might not even be a question of   33   . It’s not clear that the cruise industry will   34  . Or that public transit won’t go broke without   35   assistance. The infrastructure might not even be in place to do what we were doing in 2019.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2.

Slow Hope

A) Our world is full of—mostly untold—stories of slow hope, driven by the idea that change is possible. They are ‘slow’ in their unfolding, and they are slow because they come with setbacks.
B) At the beginning of time—so goes the myth—humans suffered, shivering in the cold and dark until the titan (巨人)Prometheus stole fire from the gods. Just as in the myth, technology—first fire and stone tools, and later farming, the steam engine and industry, fossil fuels, chemicals and nuclear power—has allowed us to alter and control the natural world. The myth also reminds us that these advances have come at a price: as a punishment for Prometheus’ crime, the gods created Pandora, and they gave her a box filled with evils and curses. When Pandora’s box was opened, it unleashed swarms of diseases and disasters upon humankind.

C) Today we can no longer ignore the ecological curses that we have released in our search for warmth and comfort. In engineering and exploiting and transforming our habitat, we have opened tens of thousands of Pandora’s boxes. In recent decades, environmental threats have expanded beyond regional boundaries to have global reach and, most hauntingly, are multiplying at a dizzying rate. On a regular basis, we are reminded that we are running out of time. Year after year, faster and faster, consumption outpaces the biological capacity of our planet. Stories of accelerated catastrophe multiply. We fear the breakdown of the electric grid, the end of non-renewable resources, the expansion of deserts, the loss of islands, and the pollution of our air and water.

D) Acceleration is the signature of our time. Populations and economic activity grew slowly for much of human history. For thousands of years and well into early modern times, world economies saw no growth at all, but from around the mid-19th century and again, in particular, since the mid-20th, the real GDP has increased at an enormous speed, and so has human consumption. In the Middle Ages, households in Central Europe might have owned fewer than 30 objects on average; in 1900, this number had increased to 400, and in 2020 to 15,000. The acceleration of human production, consumption and travel has changed the animate and inanimate spheres. It has echoed through natural processes on which humans depend. Species extinction, deforestation, damming of rivers, occurrence of floods, the depletion of ozone, the degradation of ocean systems and many other areas are all experiencing acceleration. If represented graphically, the curve for all these changes looks rather like that well-known hockey stick: with little change over millennia (数千年) and a dramatic upswing over the past decades.

E) Some of today’s narratives about the future seem to suggest that we too, like Prometheus, will be saved by a new Hercules, a divine engineer, someone who will mastermind, manoeuvre and manipulate our planet. They suggest that geoengineering, cold fusion or faster-than-light spaceships might transcend once and for all the terrestrial constraints of rising temperatures, lack of energy, scarcity of food, lack of space, mountains of waste, polluted water—you name it.

F) Yet, if we envisage our salvation to come from a deus ex machina (解围之神)，from a divine engineer or a tech solutionist who will miraculously conjure up a new source of energy or another cure-all with revolutionary potency, we might be looking in the wrong place. The fact that we now imagine our planet as a whole does not mean that the ‘rescue’ of our planet will come with one big global stroke of genius and technology. It will more likely come by many small acts. Global heating and environmental degradation are not technological problems. They are highly political issues that are informed by powerful interests. Moreover, if history is a guide, then we can assume that any major transformations will once again be followed by a huge set of unintended consequences. So what do we do?

G) This much is clear: we need to find ways that help us flatten the hockey-stick curves that reflect our ever-faster pace of ecological destruction and social acceleration. If we acknowledge that human manipulation of the Earth has been a destructive force, we can also imagine that human endeavours can help us build a less destructive world in the centuries to come. We might keep making mistakes. But we will also keep learning from our mistakes.

H) To counter the fears of disaster, we need to identify stories, visions and actions that work quietly towards a more hopeful future. Instead of one big narrative, a story of unexpected rescue by a larger-than-life hero, we need multiple stories: we need stories, not only of what Rob Nixon of Princeton University has called the ‘slow violence’ of environmental degradation (that is, the damage that is often invisible at first and develops slowly and gradually), but also stories of what I call ‘slow hope’.

I) We need an acknowledgement of our present ecological plight but also a language of positive change, visions of a better future. In The Principle of Hope (1954-1959), Ernst Bloch, one of the leading philosophers of the future, wrote that ‘the most tragic form of loss...is the loss of the capacity to imagine that things could be different’. We need to identify visions and paths that will help us imagine a different, more just and more ecological world. Hope, for Bloch, has its starting point in fear, in uncertainty, and in crisis: it is a creative force that goes hand in hand with utopian (乌托邦的)‘wishful images’. It can be found in cultural products of the past — in fairy tales, in fiction, in architecture, in music, in the movie — in products of the human mind that contain ‘the outlines of a better world’. What makes us ‘authentic’ as humans are visions of our ‘potential’. In other words: living in hope makes us human.

J) The power of small, grassroots movements to make changes that spread beyond their place of
origin can be seen with the Slow Food movement, which began in Italy in the 1980s. The rise of fast-food restaurants after the Second World War produced a society full of cheap, industrially made foodstuffs. Under the leadership of Carlo Petrini, the Slow Food movement began in Piedmont, a region of Italy with a long history of poverty, violence and resistance to oppression. The movement transformed it into a region hospitable to traditional food cultures — based on native plants and breeds of animals. Today, Slow Food operates in more than 160 countries, poor and rich. It has given rise to thousands of projects around the globe, representing democratic politics, food sovereignty, biodiversity and sustainable agriculture.

K) The unscrupulous (无所顾忌的)commodification of food and the destruction of foodstuffs will continue to devastate soils, livelihoods and ecologies. Slow Food cannot undo the irresistible developments of the global food economy, but it can upset its theorists, it can‘speak differently’, and it can allow people and their local food traditions and environments to flourish. Even in the United States—the fast-food nation—small farms and urban gardens are on the rise. The US Department of Agriculture provides an Urban Agriculture Toolkit and, according to a recent report, American millennials (千禧一代)are changing their diets. In 2017, 6 per cent of US consumers claimed to be strictly vegetarian, up from 1 per cent in 2014. As more people realise that ‘eating is an agricultural act’, as the US poet and environmental activist Wendell Berry put it in 1989, slow hope advances.

36.	It seems some people today dream that a cutting-edge new technology might save them from the present ecological disaster.

37.	According to one great thinker, it is most unfortunate if we lose the ability to think differently.

38.	Urgent attention should be paid to the ecological problems we have created in our pursuit of a comfortable life.

39.	Even in the fast-food nation America, the number of vegetarians is on the rise.

40.	The deterioration of the ecological system is accelerating because of the dramatic increase of human production and consumption.

41.	It is obvious that solutions must be found to curb the fast worsening environment and social acceleration.

42.	Many people believe changing the world is possible, though it may take time and involve setbacks.

43.	It might be wrong to expect that our world would be saved at one stroke with some miraculous technology.

44.	It is human nature to cherish hopes for a better world.

45.	Technology has given us humans the power to change the natural world, but we have paid a price for the change.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　　Vegetarians would prefer not to be compelled to eat meat. Yet the reverse compulsion (强迫)is hidden in the proposals for a new plant-based “planetary diet.” Nowhere is this more visible than in India.
　　　Earlier this year, the EAT-Lancet Commission released its global report on nutrition and called for a global shift to a more plant-based diet and for “substantially reducing consumption of animal source foods.” In countries like India, that call could become a tool to aggravate an already tense political situation and stress already undernourished populations.
　　　The EAT report presumes that “traditional diets” in countries like India include little red meat, which might be consumed only on special occasions or as minor ingredients in mixed dishes.
　　　In India, however, there is a vast difference between what people would wish to consume and what they have to consume because of innumerable barriers around class, religion, culture, cost, geography, etc. Policymakers in India have traditionally pushed for a cereal-heavy “vegetarian diet” on a meat-eating population as a way of providing the cheapest sources of food.
　　　Currently, under an aggressive Hindu nationalist government, Muslims, Christians, disadvantaged classes and indigenous communities are being compelled to give up their traditional foods.
　　　None of these concerns seem to have been appreciated by the EAT-Lancet Commission’s representative, Brent Loken, who said “India has got such a great example” in sourcing protein from plants.
　　　But how much of a model for the world is India’s vegetarianism? In the Global Hunger Index 2019, the country ranks 102nd out of 117. Data from the National Family Health Survey indicate that only 10 percent of infants of 6 to 23 months are adequately fed.
　　　Which is why calls for a plant-based diet modeled on India risk offering another whip with which to beat already vulnerable communities in developing countries.
　　　A diet directed at the affluent West fails to recognize that in low-income countries undernourished children are known to benefit from the consumption of milk and other animal source foods, improving cognitive functions, while reducing the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies as well as mortality.
　　　EAT-Lancet claimed its intention was to “spark conversations” among all Indian stakeholders. Yet vocal critics of the food processing industry and food fortification strategies have been left out of the debate. But the most conspicuous omission may well be the absence of India’s farmers.
　　　The government, however, seems to have given the report a thumbs-up. Rather than addressing chronic hunger and malnutrition through an improved access to wholesome and nutrient-dense foods, the government is opening the door for company-dependent solutions, ignoring the environmental and economic cost, which will destroy local food systems. It’s a model full of danger for future generations.

46.	What is more visible in India than anywhere else according to the passage?
A)	People’s positive views on the proposals for a “planetary diet”.
B)	People’s reluctance to be compelled to eat plant-based food.
C)	People’s preferences for the kind of food they consume.
D)	People’s unwillingness to give up their eating habits.

47.	What would the EAT-Lancet Commission’s report do to many people in countries like India?
A)	Radically change their dietary habits.
B)	Keep them further away from politics.
C)	Make them even more undernourished.
D)	Substantially reduce their food choices.

48.	What do we learn from the passage about food consumption in India?
A)	People’s diet will not change due to the EAT-Lancet report.
B)	Many people simply do not have access to foods they prefer.
C)	There is a growing popularity of a cereal-heavy vegetarian diet.
D)	Policymakers help remove the barriers to people’s choice of food.

49.	What does the passage say about a plant-based diet modeled on India?
A)	It may benefit populations whose traditional diet is meat-based.
B)	It may be another blow to the economy in developing countries.
C)	It may help narrow the gap between the rich and poor countries.
D)	It may worsen the nourishment problem in low-income countries.

50.	How does the Indian government respond to the EAT-Lancet Commission’s proposals?
A)	It accepts them at the expense of the long-term interests of its people.
B)	It intends them to spark conversations among all Indian stakeholders.
C)	It gives them approval regardless of opposition from nutrition experts.
D)	It welcomes them as a tool to address chronic hunger and malnutrition.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　　Back in 1964, in his book Games People Play, psychiatrist Eric Berne described a pattern of conversation he called “ Why Don’t You——Yes But”，which remains one of the most irritating aspects
of everyday social life. The person adopting the strategy is usually a chronic complainer. Something is terrible about their relationship, job, or other situation, and they moan about it ceaselessly, but find some excuse to dismiss any solution that’s proposed. The reason, of course, is that on some level they don’t want a solution; they want to be validated in their position that the world is out to get them. If they can  “win” the game—dismissing every suggestion until their interlocutor(对话者)gives up in annoyance—they get to feel pleasurably righteous (正当的)in their resentments and excused from any obligation to change.
　　　Part of the trouble here is the so-called responsibility/fault fallacy (谬误). When you’re feeling hard done by—taken for granted by your partner, say, or obliged to work for a half-witted boss—it’s easy to become attached to the position that it’s not your job to address the matter, and that doing so would be an admission of fault. But there’s a confusion here. For example, if I were to discover a newborn at my front door, it wouldn’t be my fault, but it most certainly would be my responsibility. There would be choices to make, and no possibility of avoiding them, since trying to ignore the matter would be a choice. The point is that what goes for the baby on the doorstep is true in all cases: even if the other person is 100% in the wrong, there’s nothing to be gained, long-term, from using this as a justification to evade responsibility.
　　　Should you find yourself on the receiving end of this kind of complaining, there’s an ingenious way to shut it down—which is to agree with it, ardently. Psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb describes this as “ over-validation ”. For one thing, you’ll be spared further moaning, since the other person’s motivation was to confirm her beliefs, and now you’re confirming them. But for another, as Gottlieb notes, people confronted with over-validation often hear their complaints afresh and start arguing back. The notion that they’re utterly powerless suddenly seems unrealistic—not to mention rather annoying—so they’re prompted instead to generate ideas about how they might change things.
　　　“And then, sometimes, something magical might happen,” Gottlieb writes. The other person “might realise she’s not as trapped as you are saying she is, or as she feels.” Which illustrates the irony of the responsibility/fault fallacy: evading responsibility feels comfortable, but turns out to be a prison; whereas assuming responsibility feels unpleasant, but ends up being freeing.

51.	What is characteristic of a chronic complainer, according to psychiatrist Eric Berne?
A)	They only feel angry about their ill treatment and resent whoever tries to help.
B)	They are chronically unhappy and ceaselessly find fault with people around them.
C)	They constantly dismiss others，proposals while taking no responsibility for tackling the problem.
D)	They lack the knowledge and basic skills required for successful conversations with their interlocutors.

52.	What does the author try to illustrate with the example of the newborn on one’s doorstep?
A)	People tend to think that one should not be held responsible for others’ mistakes.
B)	It is easy to become attached to the position of overlooking one’s own fault.
C)	People are often at a loss when confronted with a number of choices.
D)	A distinction should be drawn between responsibility and fault.

53.	What does the author advise people to do to chronic complainers?
A)	Stop them from going further by agreeing with them.
B)	Listen to their complaints ardently and sympathetically.
C)	Ask them to validate their beliefs with further evidence.
D)	Persuade them to clarify the confusion they have caused.

54.	What happens when chronic complainers receive over-validation?
A)	They are motivated to find ingenious ways to persuade their interlocutor.
B)	They are prompted to come up with ideas for making possible changes.
C)	They are stimulated to make more complaints.
D)	They are encouraged to start arguing back.

55.	How can one stop being a chronic complainer according to the author?
A)	Analysing the so-called responsibility/fault fallacy.
B)	Avoiding hazardous traps in everyday social life.
C)	Assuming responsibility to free oneself.
D)	Awaiting something magical to happen.

　　　Social distancing is putting people out of work, canceling school and tanking the stock market. It has been   26   by fear, and it is creating even more fear as money problems and uncertainty grow. However, at its core is love, and a sacrifice to protect those most   27   to the coronavirus (冠状病毒)effects — the elderly, people with compromised immune systems, and those whose life-saving resources would be used up by a   28   epidemic.
　　　Americans make life-saving decisions every day as a matter of course. We cut food into bite-sized pieces, we wear seatbelts, and we take care not to exceed the speed limit. But social distancing       is   29   in that it is completely self-sacrificing. Those who will benefit may be the elderly relatives of the   30   person we didn’t pass in Starbucks, on the subway, or in the elevator.
　　　Social distancing is millions of people making hundreds of sacrifices to keep the elderly alive. It doesn’t include the   31   to run from society or make an excuse to avoid one’s obligations — such as life-saving medical work or the parental obligation to buy groceries. What it does include is applying love through caution. And in doing so, it offers an   32   opportunity for those who care about the elderly to find new ways to love them.
　　　If we’re not   33   as much in our normal work or school, we have extra time to call parents and grandparents. We can also ask elderly relatives how to best support them   34   and use our sacrifices as an opportunity to bring us, our community and the world   35  .

Why Lifelong Learning Is the International Passport to Success

A) Picture yourself at a college graduation day, with a fresh cohort (一群)of students about to set sail for new horizons. What are they thinking while they throw their caps in the air? What is it with this thin sheet of paper that makes it so precious? It’s not only the proof of acquired knowledge but plays into the reputation game of where you were trained. Being a graduate from Harvard Law School carries that extra glamour, doesn’t it? Yet take a closer look, and the diploma is the perfect ending to the modern tragedy of education.

B) Why? Because universities and curricula are designed along the three unities of French classical tragedy: time, action, and place. Students meet at the university campus (unity of place) for classes (unity of action) during their 20s (unity of time). This classical model has traditionally produced prestigious universities, but it is now challenged by the digitalisation of society—which allows everybody who is connected to the internet to access learning — and by the need to acquire skills in step with a fast-changing world. Universities must realise that learning in your 20s won’t be enough. If technological diffusion and implementation develop faster, workers will have to constantly refresh their skills.

C) The university model needs to evolve. It must equip students with the right skills and knowledge to compete in a world ‘where value will be derived largely from human interaction and the ability to invent and interpret things that machines cannot’，as the English futurist Richard Watson puts it. By teaching foundational knowledge and up-to-date skills, universities will provide students with the future-proof skills of lifelong learning, not just get them ‘job-ready’.

D)	Some universities already play a critical role in lifelong learning as they want to keep the value of their diplomas. This new role comes with a huge set of challenges, and needs largely to be invented. One way to start this transformation process could be to go beyond the ‘five-year diploma model’ to adapt curricula to lifelong learning. We call this model the lifelong passport.

E) The Bachelor’s degree could be your passport to lifelong learning. For the first few years, students would ‘learn to learn’ and get endowed with reasoning skills that remain with them for the rest of their lives. For instance, physics allows you to observe and rationalise the world, but also to integrate observations into models and, sometimes, models into theories or laws that can be used to make predictions. Mathematics is the language used to formulate the laws of physics or economy, and to make rigorous computations that turn into predictions. These two disciplines naturally form the foundational pillars of education in technical universities.

F) Recent advances in computational methods and data science push us into rethinking science and engineering. Computers increasingly become principal actors in leveraging data to formulate questions, which requires radically new ways of reasoning. Therefore, a new discipline blending computer science, programming, statistics and machine learning should be added to the traditional foundational topics of mathematics and physics. These three pillars would allow you to keep learning complex technical subjects all your life because numeracy (计算)is the foundation upon which everything else is eventually built.

G) According to this new model, the Master of Science (MSc) would become the first stamp in the lifelong learning journey. The MSc curriculum should prepare students for their professional career by allowing them to focus on acquiring practical skills through projects.

H) Those projects are then interwoven with fast-paced technical modules (模块)learned ‘on-the-fly ’ and ‘at will’ depending on the nature of the project. If, for instance, your project is developing an integrated circuit, you will have to take a module on advanced concepts in microelectronics. The most critical skills will be developed before the project even starts, in the form of boot camps (短期强化训练)，while the rest can be fostered along with the project, putting them to immediate use and thus providing a rich learning context.

I) In addition to technical capabilities, the very nature of projects develops social and entrepreneurial skills, such as design thinking, initiative taking, team leading, activity reporting or resource planning. Not only will those skills be actually integrated into the curriculum but they will be very important to have in the future because they are difficult to automate.

J) After the MSc diploma is earned, there would be many more stamps of lifelong learning over the years. If universities decide to engage in this learning model, they will have to cope with many organisational challenges that might shake their unity of place and action. First, the number of students would be unpredictable. If all of a university’s alumni (往届毕业生)were to become students again, the student body would be much bigger than it is now, and it could become unsustainable for the campus in terms of both size and resources. Second, freshly graduated students would mix with professionally experienced ones. This would change the classroom dynamics, perhaps for the best. Project-based learning with a mixed team reflects the reality of the professional world and could therefore be a better preparation for it.

K) Sound like science fiction? In many countries, part-time studying is not exceptional: on average across OECD countries, part-time students in 2016 represented 20 per cent of enrolment in tertiary education. In many countries, this share is higher and can exceed 40 per cent in Australia, New Zealand and Sweden.

L) If lifelong learning were to become a priority and the new norm, diplomas, just like passports, could be revalidated periodically. A time-determined revalidation would ease administration for everybody. Universities as well as employers and employees would know when they have to retrain. For instance, graduates from the year 2000 would have to come back in 2005.

M) This could fix the main organisational challenges for the university, but not for the learners, due to lack of time, family obligations or funds. Here, online learning might be an option because it allows you to save your ‘travel time’, but it has its limits. So far, none of the major employers associated with online learning platforms such as Coursera and Udacity has committed to hire or even interview graduates of their new online programmes.

N) Even if time were not an issue, who will pay for lifelong learning? That’s the eternal debate: should it be the learner’s responsibility, that of his employer, or of the state? For example, in Massachusetts, the healthcare professions require continuing education credits, which are carefully evidenced and documented. Yet the same state’s lawyers don’t require continuing legal education, although most lawyers do participate in it informally. One explanation is that technology is less of a factor in law than it is in healthcare.

O) Europe has many scenarios, but the French and Swiss ones are interesting to compare. In France, every individual has a right to lifelong learning organised via a personal learning account that is credited as you work. In Switzerland, lifelong learning is a personal responsibility and not a government one. However, employers and the state encourage continuing education either by funding parts of it or by allowing employees to attend it.

P) Universities have a fundamental role to play in this journey, and higher education is in for a change. Just like classical theatre, the old university model produced talent and value for society. We are not advocating its abolition but rather calling for the adaptation of its characteristics to meet the needs of today. 

36.	Students should develop the key skills before they start a project.

37.	By acquiring reasoning skills in the first few years of college, students can lay a foundation for lifelong learning.

38.	The easy access to learning and rapid technological changes have brought the traditional model of education under challenge.
39.	Unbelievable as it may seem, part-time students constitute a considerable portion of the student body in many universities across the world.

40.	Some social and managerial skills, which are not easily automated, will be of great importance to students’ future careers.

41.	A new model of college education should provide students with the knowledge and skills that will make them more inventive and capable of lifelong learning.

42.	A mixed student body may change the classroom dynamics and benefit learning.

43.	The question of who will bear the cost of lifelong learning is a topic of constant debate.

44.	To the traditional subjects of math and physics should be added a new discipline which combines computer science with statistics and other components.

45.	Students who are burdened with family duties might choose to take online courses.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　　Why does social media trigger feelings of loneliness and inadequacy? Because instead of being real life, it is, for the most part, impression management, a way of marketing yourself, carefully choosing and filtering the pictures and words to put your best face forward.
　　　Online “friends” made through social media do not follow the normal psychological progression of an interpersonal relationship. You share neither physical time nor emotional conversations over the Internet. You simply communicate photographs and catchy posts to a diverse group of people whom you have “friended” or “followed” based on an accidental interaction. This is not to say that your social media friends can’t be real friends. They absolutely can, but the two are not synonymous.
　　　Generally speaking, there are no unfiltered comments or casually taken photos on our social media pages. And, rightfully so, because it wouldn’t feel safe to be completely authentic and vulnerable with some of our “ friends ” whom we don’t actually know or with whom trust has yet to be built.
　　　Social media can certainly be an escape from the daily grind, but we must be cautioned against the negative effects, such as addiction, on a person’s overall psychological well-being.
　　　As humans, we yearn for social connection. Scrolling (滚动)through pages of pictures and comments, however, does not provide the same degree of fulfillment as face-to-face interactions do. Also, we tend to idealize others’ lives and compare our downfalls to their greatest accomplishments, ending in feelings of loneliness and inadequacy.
　　　Social media can lead people on the unhealthy quest for perfection. Some people begin to attend certain events or travel to different places so that they can snap that “ perfect ” photo. They begin to seek validation through the number of people who “ like ” their posts. In order for it to play a psychologically healthy role in your social life, social media should supplement an already healthy social network. Pictures and posts should be byproducts of life’s treasured moments and fun times, not the planned and calculated image that one is putting out into cyberspace in an attempt to fill insecurities or unmet needs.
　　　Ultimately, social media has increased our ability to connect with various types of people all over the globe. It has opened doors for businesses and allowed us to stay connected to people whom we may not otherwise get to follow. However, social media should feel like a fun experience, not one that contributes to negative thoughts and feelings. If the latter is the case, increasing face-to-face time with trusted friends, and minimizing time scrolling online, will prove to be a reminder that your social network is much more rewarding than any “ like,” “ follow ” or “ share ” can be.

46.	What does the author imply social media may do to our life?
A)	It may facilitate our interpersonal relationships.
B)	It may filter our negative impressions of others.
C)	It may make us feel isolated and incompetent.
D)	It may render us vulnerable and inauthentic.

47.	Why do people post comments selectively on social media?
A)	They do not find all their online friends trustworthy.
B)	They want to avoid offending any of their audience.
C)	They do not want to lose their followers.
D)	They are eager to boost their popularity.

48.	What are humans inclined to do according to the passage?
A)	Exaggerate their life’s accomplishments.	
B)	Strive for perfection regardless of the cost. 
C) Paint a rosy picture of other people’s lives.
D) Learn lessons from other people’s downfalls.

49.	What is the author’s view of pictures and posts on social media?
A)	They should record the memorable moments in people’s lives.
B)	They should be carefully edited so as to present the best image.
C)	They should be shown in a way that meets one’s security needs.
D)	They should keep people from the unhealthy quest for perfection.

50.	What does the author advise people to do when they find their online experience unconstructive?
A)	Use social media to increase their ability to connect with various types of people.
B)	Stay connected to those whom they may not otherwise get to know and befriend.
C)	Try to prevent negative thoughts and feelings from getting into the online pages.
D)	Strengthen ties with real-life friends instead of caring about their online image.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　　Imagine that an alien species landed on Earth and, through their mere presence, those aliens caused our art to vanish, our music to homogenize, and our technological know-how to disappear. That is effectively what humans have been doing to our closest relatives — chimps (大猩猩).
　　　Back in 1999, a team of scientists led by Andrew Whiten showed that chimps from different parts of Africa behave very differently from one another. Some groups would get each other’s attention by rapping branches with their knuckles (指关节)，while others did it by loudly ripping leaves with their teeth. The team identified 39 of these traditions that are practiced by some communities but not   others — a pattern that, at the time, hadn’t been seen in any animal except humans. It was evidence, the team said, that chimps have their own cultures.
　　　It took a long time to convince skeptics that such cultures exist, but now we have plenty of examples of animals learning local traditions from one another.
　　　But just when many scientists have come to accept the existence of animal cultures, many of those cultures might vanish. Ammie Kalan and her colleagues have shown, through years of intensive fieldwork, that the very presence of humans has eroded the diversity of chimp behavior. Where we flourish, their cultures wither. It is a bitterly ironic thing to learn on the 20th anniversary of Whiten’s classic study.
　　　“ It’s amazing to think that just 60 years ago, we knew next to nothing of the behavior of our sister species in the wild,” Whiten says. “ But now, just as we are truly getting to know our primate(灵长类)cousins, the actions of humans are closing the window on all we have discovered.”
　　　“ Sometimes in the rush to conserve the species, I think we forget about the individuals,” says Cat Hobaiter, a professor at the University of St. Andrews. “ Each population, each community, even each generation of chimps is unique. An event might only have a small impact on the total population of chimps, but it may wipe out an entire community — an entire culture. No matter what we do to restore habitat or support population growth, we may never be able to restore that culture.”
　　　No one knows whether the destruction of chimp culture is getting worse. Few places have tracked chimp behavior over long periods, and those that have are also more likely to have protected their animals from human influence.
　　　Obviously, conservationists need to think about saving species in a completely new way—by preserving animal traditions as well as bodies and genes. “ Instead of focusing only on the conservation of genetically based entities like species, we now need to also consider culturally based entities,” says Andrew Whiten.

　　　A new study has drawn a bleak picture of cultural inclusiveness reflected in the children’s literature available in Australia. Dr. Helen Adam from Edith Cowan  University’s School of Education   	26	   the cultural diversity of children’s books. She examined the books   27   in the kindergarten rooms of four day-care centers in  Western Australia. Just 18 percent of 2,413 books in the total collection contained any   28   of non-white people. Minority cultures were often featured in stereotypical or tokenistic ways, for example, by   29  	 Asian culture with chopsticks and traditional dress. Characters that did represent a minority culture usually had   30   roles in the books. The main characters were mostly Caucasian. This causes concern as it can lead to  an impression that whiteness is of greater value. 
　　　Dr. Adam said children formed impressions about ‘difference’ and identity from a very young age. Evidence has shown they develop own-race    31  from as young as three months of age. The books we share with young children can be a valuable   opportunity to develop children’s understanding of themselves and others. Books can also allow children to see diversity. They discover both similarities and differences between themselves and others. This can help develop understanding,acceptance and   32    of diversity. 
　　　Census data has shown Australians come from more than 200 countries. They speak over 300 languages at home. Additionally, Australians belong to more than 100 different religious groups. They also work in more than 1,000 different occupations. “Australia is a multicultural society. The current   33	  promotion of white middle-class ideas and lifestyles risks   34   children from minority groups. This can give white middle-class children a sense of   35   or privilege,” Dr. Adam said.

How Marconi Gave Us the Wireless World
A) 	A hundred years before iconic figures like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs permeated our lives, an Irish-Italian inventor laid the foundation of the communication explosion of the 21st century. Guglielmo Marconi was arguably the first truly global figure in modern communication. Not only was he the first to communicate globally, he was the first to think globally about communication. Marconi may not have been the greatest inventor of his time, but more than anyone else, he brought about a fundamental shift in the way we communicate.
B)	Today’s globally networked media and communication system has its origins in the 19th century, when, for the first time, messages were sent electronically across great distances. The telegraph, the telephone, and radio were the obvious predecessors of the Internet, iPods, and mobile phones. What made the link from then to now was the development of wireless communication. Marconi was the first to develop and perfect this system, using the recently-discovered “air waves” that make up the electromagnetic spectrum.
C) 	Between 1896, when he applied for his first patent in England at the age of 22, and his death in Italy in 1937, Marconi was at the center of every major innovation in electronic communication. He was also a skilled and sophisticated organizer, an entrepreneurial innovator, who mastered the use of corporate strategy, media relations, government lobbying, international diplomacy, patents, and prosecution. Marconi was really interested in only one thing: the extension of mobile, personal, long-distance communication to the ends of the earth (and beyond, if we can believe some reports). Some like to refer to him as a genius, but if there was any genius to Marconi it was this vision.
D) 	In 1901 he succeeded in signaling across the Atlantic, from the west coast of England to Newfoundland in the USA, despite the claims of science that it could not be done. In 1924 he convinced the British government to encircle the world with a chain of wireless stations using the latest technology that he had devised, shortwave radio. There are some who say Marconi lost his edge when commercial broadcasting came along; he didn’t see that radio could or should be used to frivolous (无聊的) ends. In one of his last public speeches, a radio broadcast to the United States in March 1937, he deplored that broadcasting had become a one-way means of communication and foresaw it moving in another direction, toward communication as a means of exchange. That was visionary genius.
E)	Marconi’s career was devoted to making wireless communication happen cheaply, efficiently, Smoothly, and with an elegance that would appear to be intuitive and uncomplicated to the user—user-friendly, if you will. There is a direct connection from Marconi to today’s social media, search engines, and program streaming that can best be summed up by an admittedly provocative exclamation: the 20th century did not exist. In a sense, Marconi’s vision jumped from his time to our own.
F) 	Marconi invented the idea of global communication—or, more straightforwardly, globally networked, mobile, wireless communication. Initially, this was wireless Morse code telegraphy (电报通讯) , the principal communication technology of his day. Marconi was the first to develop a practical method for wireless telegraphy   using radio waves. He borrowed technical details from many sources, but what set him apart was a self-confident vision of the power of communication technology on the one hand, and,on the other, of the steps that needed to be taken to consolidate his own position as a player in that field. Tracing Marconi’s lifeline leads us into the   story of modern communication itself. There were other important figures, but Marconi towered over them all in reach, power, and influence, as well as in the grip he had on the popular imagination of his time. Marconi was quite simply the central figure in the emergence of a modern understanding of communication.
G) 	In his lifetime, Marconi foresaw the development of television and the fax machine, GPS, radar, and the portable hand-held telephone. Two months before he died,newspapers were reporting that he was working on a “death ray,” and that he had “killed a rat with an intricate device at a distance of three feet.” By then, anything Marconi said or did was newsworthy. Stock prices rose or sank according to his pronouncements. If Marconi said he thought it might rain, there was likely to be a run on umbrellas.
H) 	Marconi’s biography is also a story about choices and the motivations behind them. At one level, Marconi could be fiercely autonomous and independent of the constraints of his own social class. On another scale, he was a perpetual outsider. Wherever he went, he was never “of ” the group; he was always the “other,” considered foreign in Britain, British in Italy, and “not American” in the United States. At the same time, he also suffered tremendously from a need for acceptance that drove, and sometimes stained, every one of his relationships.
I)	Marconi placed a permanent stamp on the way we live. He was the first person to imagine a practical application for the wireless spectrum, and to develop it successfully into a global communication system—in both terms of the word; that is, worldwide and all-inclusive. He was able to do this because of a combination of factors—most important, timing and opportunity—but the single-mindedness and determination with which he carried out his self-imposed mission was fundamentally character-based; millions of Marconi’s contemporaries had the same class, gender, race, and colonial privilege as he,but only a handful did anything with it. Marconi needed to achieve the goal that was set in his mind as an adolescent; by the time he reached adulthood, he understood, intuitively, that in order to have an impact he had to both develop an independent economic base and align himself with political power. Disciplined, uncritical loyalty to political power became his compass for the choices he had to make.
J) 	At the same time, Marconi was uncompromisingly independent intellectually. Shortly after Marconi’s death, the nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi—soon to be the developer of the Manhattan Project—wrote that Marconi proved that theory and experimentation were complementary features of progress. “Experience can rarely, unless guided by a theoretical concept, arrive at results of any great significance...on the other hand, an excessive trust in theoretical conviction would have prevented Marconi from persisting in experiments which were destined to bring about a revolution in the technique of radio-communications.” In other words, Marconi had the advantage of not being burdened by preconceived assumptions.
K)	The most controversial aspect of Marconi’s life—and the reason why there has been no satisfying biography of Marconi until now—was his uncritical embrace of Benito Mussolini. At first this was not problematic for him. But as the regressive (倒退的) nature of Mussolini’s regime became clear, he began to suffer a crisis of conscience. However, after a lifetime of moving within the circles of power, he was unable to break with authority, and served Mussolini faithfully (as president of Italy’s national research council and royal academy, as well as a member of the Fascist Grand Council) until the day he died—conveniently—in 1937, shortly before he would have had to take a stand in the conflict that consumed a world that he had, in part, created.
36.	Marconi was central to our present-day understanding of communication.
37.	As an adult, Marconi had an intuition that he had to be loyal to politicians in order to be influential.
38.	Marconi disapproved of the use of wireless communication for commercial broadcasting.
39.	Marconi’s example demonstrates that theoretical concepts and experiments complement each other in making progress in science and technology.
40.	Marconi’s real interest lay in the development of worldwide wireless communication.
41.	Marconi spent his whole life making wireless communication simple to use.
42. Because of his long-time connection with people in power，Marconi was unable to cut himself off from the fascist regime in Italy.
43. In his later years, Marconi exerted a tremendous influence on all aspects of people’s life.
44. What connected the 19th century and our present time was the development of wireless communication.
45.Despite his autonomy, Marconi felt alienated and suffered from a lack of acceptance.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Humans are fascinated by the source of their failings and virtues. This preoccupation inevitably leads to an old debate: whether nature or nurture moulds us more. A revolution in genetics has poised this as a modern political question about the character of our society: if personalities are hard-wired into our genes,what can governments do to help us? It feels morally questionable, yet claims of genetic selection by intelligence are making headlines.
　　　This is down to“hereditarian”(遗传论的) science and a recent paper claimed “differences in exam performance between pupils attending selective and non-selective schools mirror the genetic differences between them”. With such an assertion, the work was predictably greeted by a lot of absurd claims about “genetics determining academic success”. What the research revealed was the rather less surprising result: the educational benefits of selective schools largely disappear once pupils’ inborn ability and socio-economic background were taken into account. It is a glimpse of the blindingly obvious—and there’s nothing to back strongly either a hereditary or environmental argument.
　　　Yet the paper does say children are “unintentionally genetically selected” by the school system. Central to hereditarian science is a tall claim: that identifiable variations in genetic sequences can predict an individual’s aptness to learn, reason and solve problems. This is problematic on many levels. A teacher could not seriously tell a parent their child has a low genetic tendency to study when external factors clearly exist. Unlike-minded academics say the inheritability of human traits is scientifically unsound. At best there is a weak statistical association and not a causal link between DNA and intelligence. Yet sophisticated statistics are used to create an intimidatory atmosphere of scientific certainty.
　　　While there’s an undoubted genetic basis to individual difference, it is wrong to think that socially defined groups can be genetically accounted for.The fixation on genes as destiny is surely false too. Medical predictability can rarely be based on DNA alone; the environment matters too. Something as complex as intellect is likely to be affected by many factors beyond genes. If hereditarians want to advance their cause it will require more balanced interpretation and not just acts of advocacy.
　　　Genetic selection is a way of exerting influence over others, “the ultimate collective control of humandestinies,” as writer H.G.Wells put it. Knowledge becomes power and power requires a sense of responsibility. In understanding cognitive ability, we must not elevate discrimination to a science: allowing people to climb the ladder of life only as far as their cells might suggest. This will need a more sceptical eye on the science.As technology progresses, we all have a duty to make sure that we shape a future that we would want to find ourselves in.
46. What did a recent research paper claim?
　　A) The type of school students attend makes a difference to their future.
　　B) Genetic differences between students are far greater than supposed.
　　C) The advantages of selective schools are too obvious to ignore.
　　D) Students’ academic performance is determined by their genes.
47. What does the author think of the recent research?
　　A) Its result was questionable.	
　　B) Its implication was positive.	
　　C) Its influence was rather negligible.
　　D) Its conclusions were enlightening.
48. What does the author say about the relationship between DNA and intelligence?
　　A) It is one of scientific certainty.	
　　B) It is not one of cause and effect.	
　　C) It is subject to interpretation of statistics.
　　D) It is not fully examined by gene scientists.
49. What do hereditarians need to do to make their claims convincing?
　　A) Take all relevant factors into account in interpreting their data.
　　B) Conduct their research using more sophisticated technology.
　　C) Gather gene data from people of all social classes.
　　D) Cooperate with social scientists in their research.
50. What does the author warn against in the passage?
　　A) Exaggerating the power of technology in shaping the world.
　　B) Losing sight of professional ethics in conducting research.
　　C) Misunderstanding the findings of human cognition research.
　　D) Promoting discrimination in the name of science.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Nicola Sturgeon’s speech last Tuesday setting out the Scottish government’s legislative programme for the year ahead confirmed what was already pretty clear. Scottish councils are set to be the first in the UK with the power to levy charges on visitors, with Edinburgh likely to lead the way.
　　　Tourist taxes are not new. The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has a longstanding policy of charging visitors a daily fee. France’s tax on overnight stays was introduced to assist thermal spa (温泉) towns to develop, and around half of French local authorities use it today.
　　　But such levies are on the rise. Moves by Barcelona and Venice to deal with the phenomenon of “over-tourism” through the use of charges have recently gained prominence. Japan and Greece are among the countries to have recently introduced tourist taxes.
　　　That the UK lags behind is due to our weak, by international standards, local government, as well as the opposition to taxes and regulation of our aggressively pro-market ruling party. Some UK cities have lobbied without success for the power to levy a charge on visitors. Such levies are no universal remedy as the amounts raised would be tiny compared with what has been taken away by central government since 2010. Still, it is to be hoped that the Scottish government’s bold move will prompt others to act. There is no reason why visitors to the UK, or domestic tourists on holiday in hotspots such as Cornwall, should be exempt from taxation—particularly when vital local services including waste collection, park maintenance and arts and culture spending are under unprecedented strain.
　　　On the contrary, compelling tourists to make a financial contribution to the places they visit beyond their personal consumption should be part of a wider cultural shift. Westerners with disposable incomes have often behaved as if they have a right to go wherever they choose with little regard for the consequences.Just as the environmental harm caused by aviation and other transport must come under far greater scrutiny, the social cost of tourism must also be confronted. This includes the impact of short-term lets on housing costs and quality of life for residents. Several European capitals, including Paris and Berlin, are leading a campaign for tougher regulation by the European Union. It also includes the impact of overcrowding, litter and the kinds of behaviour associated with noisy parties.
　　　There is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to this problem.The existence of new revenue streams for some but not all councils is complicated, and businesses are often opposed, fearing higher costs will make them uncompetitive. But those places that want them must be given the chance to make tourist taxes work.
51. What do we learn from Nicola Sturgeon’s speech?
　　	A) The UK is set to adjust its policy on taxation.
　　	B) Tourists will have to pay a tax to visit Scotland.
　　	C) The UK will take new measures to boost tourism.
　　	D) Edinburgh contributes most to Scotland’s tourism.
52. How come the UK has been slow in imposing the tourist tax?
　　	A) Its government wants to attract more tourists.
　　	B) The tax is unlikely to add much to its revenue.
　　	C) Its ruling party is opposed to taxes and regulation.
　　	D) It takes time for local governments to reach consensus.
53. Both international and domestic visitors in the UK should pay tourist tax so as to       	.
　　	A) elevate its tourism to international standards
　　	B) improve the welfare of its maintenance workers
　　	C) promote its cultural exchange with other nations
　　	D) ease its financial burden of providing local services
54. What does the author say about Western tourists?
　　	A) They don’t seem to care about the social cost of tourism.
　　	B) They don’t seem to mind paying for additional services.
　　	C) They deem travel an important part of their life.
　　	D) They subject the effects of tourism to scrutiny.
55. What are UK people’s opinions about the levy of tourist tax?
　　	A) Supportive.	C) Skeptical.
　　	B) Divided.	D) Unclear.

Part III	Reading Comprehension	(40 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
　　　I’m always baffled when I walk into a pharmacy and see shelves bursting with various vitamins, extracts and other supplements, all promising to accelerate or promote weight loss. Aisles of marketing genius belie (掩饰) the fact that,  					26										 , weight loss is dictated by the laws of arithmetic. Economist Jessica Irvine wrote a book about how she used math to help her lose more than 18 kilograms. If calories taken in are less than calories   27  , weight shall be lost, and so it is with money.
　　　 Despite the  							2	8							  of financial products, services and solutions geared towards accumulating wealth, it all begins with the same  						29						 : getting ahead financially requires a reduction of spending, so that income is greater than expenses. I was reminded of this again recently listening to an interview with Nicole Haddow, the author of Smashed Avocado, explaining how she cracked the property market at 31. It was quite a  								30							 , given where she had been two years earlier.
　　　Nicole didn’t celebrate her 30th birthday as she had  						31							 . She was sobbing at the dinner table with her parents, with whom she had just moved back in. She had no stable income, $ 12,000 in credit-card debt and no plan, but to her 32, her father, an accountant, told her that her financial  						33								  wasn’t as bad as she thought. He said,on her income, with some changes, she would be able to buy an investment unit within two years, which she did.
　　　Nieole admitted she was fortunate, as she was able to live with her parents and  				34													 her spending—and life—to get herself on track financially. Creating a gap between her income and spending required a paradigm shift and   35   sacrifice and commitment, but by going into financial lockdown, Nicole gained financial independence.

Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2.
France’s beloved cathedral only minutes away from complete destruction
A) 	Notre Dame Cathedral in the heart of Paris was within “15 to 30 minutes” of complete destruction as firefighters battled to stop flames reaching its bell towers on Monday evening, French authorities have revealed. A greater disaster was averted by members of the Paris fire brigade, who risked their lives to remain inside the burning monument to create a wall of water between the raging fire and the two towers on the west of the building.
B) 	The revelation of how close France came to losing its most famous cathedral emerged as police investigators questioned workers involved in the restoration of the monument to try to establish the cause of the devastating blaze.Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said that an initial fire alert was sounded at 6:20 pm on Monday evening but no fire was found.The second alert was sounded at 6:43 pm, and the blaze was discovered on the roof.
C)	More than €650 million was raised in a few hours on Tuesday as French business leaders and global corporations announced they would donate to a restoration campaign launched by the president, Emmanuel Macron. But as the emergency services picked through the burnt debris, a row was resurfacing over accusations that the beloved cathedral, immortalised in Victor Hugo’s novel, was already crumbling before the fire.
D) 	The cathedral is owned by the French state and has been at the centre of a years-long dispute over who should finance restoration work of the collapsing staircases, crumbling statues and cracked walls. Jean-Michel Leniaud, the president of the scientific council at the National Heritage Institute, said: “What happened was bound to happen. The lack of adequate maintenance and daily attention to such a majestic building is the cause of this catastrophe.” After the blaze was declared completely extinguished, 15 hours after it started, the junior interior minister, Laurent Nunez, said the structure had been saved but remained vulnerable. He praised the actions of the firefighters but admitted the fate of the cathedral had been uncertain. “They saved the main structure, but it all came down to 15—30 minutes,” Nunez said. 
E) 	In a surprise televised address on Tuesday evening, Macron said he wanted to see the cathedral rebuilt within five years. “The fire at Notre Dame reminds us that we will always have challenges to overcome,” Macron said, “Notre Dame is our history, our literature, the centre of our life. It is the standard by which we measure our distances. It’s so many books, so many paintings. It’s the cathedral of every French person, even those who have never visited it. This history is ours and so we will rebuild Notre Dame. It is what the French people expect; it is what our history deserves. It is our deep destiny. We will rebuild Notre Dame so it is even more beautiful than before. I want it done in the next five years. We can do it. After the time of testing comes a time of reflection and then of action.”
F)	The fire, which had started at the base of the 93-metre spire (尖塔) at about 6:40 pm on Monday, spread through the cathedral’s roof, made up of hundreds of oak beams, some dating back to the 13th century. These beams, known as la forêt ( the forest) because of their density, formed the cross-shaped roof that ran the length of the central part of the cathedral. As hundreds of tourists and Parisians stood and watched the flames leaping from the roof, there was shock and tears as the cathedral spire caught fire, burned and then collapsed into itself.
G)	A collection of dramatic videos and photos quickly spread across social media, showing the horrifying destruction, and attracting emotional responses from people all over the world. Indeed, within minutes the fire occupied headlines of every major global newspaper and television network. This is not surprising given Notre Dame Cathedral, meaning “Our Lady”, is one of the most recognised symbols of the city of Paris attracting millions of tourists every year.
H) 	While the world looked on, the 500 firefighters at the scene then battled to prevent the flames from reaching the two main towers, where the cathedral bells hang. If the wooden frame of the towers had caught fire, it could have sent the bells—the largest of which, the Emmanuel Bell, weighs 13 tons—crashing down, potentially causing the collapse of both towers. Police and fire services will spend the next 48 hours assessing the “security and safety” of the 850-year-old structure. Nunez said: “We have identified vulnerabilities throughout the structure, all of which still need securing.” As a result, residents of five buildings around the northern side of the cathedral were being temporarily evacuated, he added. Architects have identified three main holes in the structure, in the locations of the spire, the main hall and the upper rooms to the north of the central aisle. Most of the wooden roof beams have been burned, and parts of the concrete holding up the roof have collapsed.
I)	The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, visited the cathedral on Tuesday afternoon to see the extent of the devastation. Ash covered the marble diamond-patterned floor and floated in large pools of grey water from the fire hoses. Behind a heap of blackened oak beams that lay piled up where they had fallen, daylight from vast holes in the cathedral roof lit a golden cross over a statue by Nicolas Coustou, which appeared to have escaped damage. Preliminary inspections also suggested the three ornate (装饰华丽的) stained glass “rose” windows appeared to have survived the fire, officials said. However, fire officers have said a complete inventory of the damage will not be possible until the cathedral structure has been deemed safe.
J) 	The culture minister, Franck Riester, said religious relics saved from the cathedral were being securely held at the Hotel de Ville, and works of art that sustained smoke damage were being taken to the Louvre, the world’s largest art museum, where they would be dried out, repaired and stored. Sixteen copper statues that decorated the spire had been removed for restoration only a few days before the fire. Relics at the top of the spire are believed lost as the spire was destroyed. As well as damage from the heat, which firefighters said reached more than 800 ℃, experts also need to assess damage from the vast quantities of water firefighters poured into the cathedral. One casualty of this was The Great Organ constructed in the 1730s, which was said to have escaped the flames but been significantly damaged by water.
K)	French political commentators noted the devastating fire had succeeded where Macron had failed in uniting the country.But criticism over the original state of the building is likely to intensify overcoming days. Leniaud told La Croix newspaper: “This is not about looking for people to blame. The responsibility is collective because this is the most loved monument in the country.”Alexandre Gady, an art historian, agreed. “We’ve been saying for years that the budget for maintaining historic monuments is too low,” Gady said. The Paris prosecutor’s office has opened an inquiry into “involuntary destruction by fire”, indicating they believe the cause of the blaze was accidental rather than criminal.
36. 	The total amount of damage to Notre Dame Cathedral can be assessed only when its structure is considered safe. 
37. 	Once again people began to argue whether Notre Dame Cathedral was going to collapse even without the fire. 
38. 	The Notre Dame Cathedral catastrophe was said to have helped unite the French nation. 
39. 	The roof of Notre Dame Cathedral was built with large numbers of densely laid-out wood beams. 
40. 	Renovation workers of Notre Dame Cathedral were questioned to find out the cause of the accident. 
41. 	Had the bell towers’ wooden frames burned down, the heavy bells would have crashed down. 
42. 	The timely action of the firefighters prevented the fire from reaching the Cathedral’s bell towers. 
43. 	Apart from the fire, the water used to extinguish it also caused a lot of damage to Notre Dame Cathedral. 
44. 	There has been argument over the years as to who should pay for the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral. 
45. 	News of the Notre Dame Cathedral catastrophe instantly caught media attention throughout the world.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　We often think of drawing as something that takes inborn talent, but this kind of thinking stems from our misclassification of drawing as, primarily, an art form rather than a tool for learning.
　　　Researchers, teachers, and artists are starting to see how drawing can positively impact a wide variety of skills and disciplines.
　　　Most of us have spent some time drawing before, but at some point,most of us stop drawing. There are people who don’t, obviously, and thank god for that: a world without designers and artists would be a very shabby one indeed.
　　　Some argue that so many adults have abandoned drawing because we’ve miscategorized it and given it a very narrow definition.In his book, Stick Figures:Drawing as a Human Practice, Professor D.B. Dowd argues that we have misfiled the significance of drawing because we see it as a professional skill instead of a personal capacity.We mistakenly think of “good” drawings as those which work as recreations of the real world, as realistic illusions.Rather, drawing should be recategorized as a symbolic tool.
　　　Human beings have been drawing for 73,000 years. It’s part of what it means to be human. We don’t have the strength of chimpanzees (大猩猩) because we’ve given up animal strength to manipulate subtle instruments，like hammers, spears, and—later—pens and pencils. The human hand is an extremely dense network of nerve endings. In many ways, human beings are built to draw.
　　　Some researchers argue that doodling（涂画) activates the brain’s so-called default circuit—essentially, the areas of the brain responsible for maintaining a baseline level of activity in the absence of other stimuli. Because of this, some believe that doodling during a boring lecture can help students pay attention. In one study, participants were asked to listen to a list of names while either doodling or sitting still. Those who doodled remembered 29 percent more of the names than those who did not.
　　　There’s also evidence that drawing talent is based on how accurately someone perceives the world. The human visual system tends to misjudge size, shape, color, and angles but artists perceive these qualities more accurately than non-artists. Cultivating drawing talent can become an essential tool to improve people’s observational skills in fields where the visual is important.
　　　Rather than think of drawing as a talent that some creative people are gifted in,we should consider it as a tool for seeing and understanding the world better—one that just so happens to double as an art form. Both absent-minded doodling and copying from life have been shown to positively affect your memory and visual perception, so complain loudly the next time your school board slashes the art department’s budget.
46. What do people generally think about drawing?
　　	A) It is a gift creative people are endowed with. 
　　	B) It is a skill that is acquired with practice. 
　　	C) It is an art form that is appreciated by all.
　　	D) It is an ability everyone should cultivate.
47. What do we learn about designers and artists?
　　	A) They are declining gradually in number.
　　	B) They are keen on changing shabby surroundings.
　　	C) They add beauty and charm to the world.
　　	D) They spend most of their lives drawing.
48. What does Professor D.B.Dowd argue in his book?
　　	A) Everybody is born with the capacity to draw.
　　	B) Drawing is a skill that requires special training.
　　	C) The value of drawing tends to be overestimated.
　　	D) Drawing should be redefined as a realistic illusion.
49. What have some researchers found from one study about doodling?
　　	A) It is a must for maintaining a base level of brain activity.
　　	B) It can turn something boring into something interesting.
　　	C) It is the most reliable stimulant to activate the brain.
　　	D) It helps improve concentration and memory.
50. What is characteristic of people with dra wing talent?
　　A) Sensitivity to cognitive stimulation.	
　　B) Subtlety of representation.	
　　C) Accuracy in categorization.
　　D) Precision in visual perception.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　The car has reshaped our cities. It seems to offer autonomy for everyone. There is something almost delightful in the detachment from reality of advertisements showing mass-produced cars marketed as symbols of individuality and of freedom when most of their lives will be spent making short journeys on choked roads.
　　　For all the fuss made about top speeds, cornering ability and acceleration, the most useful gadgets on a modern car are those which work when you’re going very slowly: parking sensors, sound systems, and navigation apps which will show a way around upcoming traffic jams. This seems to be one of the few areas where the benefit of sharing personal information comes straight back to the sharer: because these apps know where almost all the users are, and how fast they are moving almost all the time, they can spot traffic congestion (堵塞) very quickly and suggest ways round it.
　　　The problem comes when everyone is using a navigation app which tells them to avoid everyone else using the same gadget. Traffic jams often appear where no one has enough information to avoid them. When a lucky few have access to the knowledge, they will benefit greatly. But when everyone has perfect information, traffic jams simply spread onto the side roads that seem to offer a way round them.
　　　This new congestion teaches us two things. The first is that the promises of technology will never be realised as fully as we hope; they will be limited by their unforeseen and unintended consequences. Siting in a more comfortable car in a different traffic jam is pleasant but hardly the liberation that once seemed to be promised. The second is that self-organisation will not get us where we want to go. The efforts of millions of drivers to get ahead do not miraculously produce a situation in which everyone does better than before, but one in which almost everyone does rather worse. Central control and collective organisationcan produce smoother and fairer outcomes, though even that much is never guaranteed.
　　　Similar limits can be foreseen for the much greater advances promised by self-driving cars. Last week, one operated by the taxi company Uber struck and killed a woman pushing her bicycle across a wide road in Arizona. This was the first recorded death involving a car which was supposed to be fully autonomous. Experts have said that it suggests a “catastrophic failure” of technology.
　　　Increasingly, even Silicon Valley has to acknowledge the costs of the intoxicating (令人陶醉的）hurry that characterises its culture. What traffic teaches us is that reckless and uncontrolled change is as likely to harm us as it is to benefit us, and that thoughtful regulation is necessary for a better future.
51. What does the author say about car advertisements?
　　	A) They portray drivers who enjoy speed on the road.
　　	B) They present a false picture of the autonomy cars provide.
　　	C) They pursue individuality and originality in design concept.
　　	D) They overestimate the potential market of autonomous cars.
52. What does the author imply about the various gadgets on cars?
　　	A) They can help to alleviate traffic jams.
　　	B) Most of them are as effective as advertised.
　　	C) Only some can be put to use under current traffic conditions.
　　	D) They are constantly upgraded to make driving easier and safer.
53. What does the author say about the use of navigation apps?
　　	A) It is likely to create traffic jams in other places.
　　	B) It helps a great deal in easing traffic congestion.
　　	C) It sharply reduces the incidence of traffic accidents.
　　	D) It benefits those who are learning to drive.
54. What does the author say about technology?
　　	A) Its consequences are usually difficult to assess.
　　	B) It seldom delivers all the benefits as promised.
　　	C) It depends on the required knowledge for application.
　　	D) Its benefits are guaranteed by collective wisdom.
55. What key message does the author try to convey in the passage?
　　	A) The consequences of technological innovation need not be exaggerated.
　　	B) There is always a price to pay to develop technology for a better world.
　　	C) Technological innovation should be properly regulated.
　　	D) The culture of Silicon Valley ought not to be emulated.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　　At 43, I’ve reached the stage where women are warned to watch out for the creeping sadness of middle age. We’re served up an endless stream of advice on “how to survive your 40s ”, as if we’re in the endurance stage of a slow limp toward 									26													. This is the age women start to become “invisible”—our value, attractiveness and power supposedly 								27											 by the vanishing of youth. But I don’t feel like I’m fading into 													28																.	 I feel more seen than I ever have, and for the first time in my life, I have a clear-eyed view of myself that is 									29												, compassionate and accepting.
　　　When I look in the mirror, I’m proud of who I am—even those “broken” parts that  for so long seemed impossible to love. So when advertisers try to sell me ways to “turn back the clock”, I have to 													30																 a laugh. I wouldn’t go back to the crippling self-consciousness of my youth if you paid me. This hard-won sense of self-acceptance is one of the joys of being an older woman. But it’s a narrative often  							31															 out by the shame that marketers rely on to peddle us their diet pills, miracle face creams and breathable yoga pants—as if self-love is a 												32														 commodity.
　　　For some women I know, this sense of trust and self-belief later in life gave them the courage to leave dysfunctional relationships or 										33													 on new career paths. Others talked about enjoying their own company, of growth through   34  	, deepening bonds of friendships, the ability to be more compassionate, less judgmental and to listen more and appreciate the small pleasures. Life past 40 is far from smooth sailing, but it’s so much more than the reductive 										35															 we see in women’s magazines and on the Hollywood big screen.

What Are the Ethics of CGI Actors-And Will They Replace Real Ones?
A) Digital humans are coming to a screen near you. As computer-generated imagery(CGI) has become cheaper and more sophisticated, the film industry can now convincingly recreate people on screen—even actors who have been dead for decades. The technology’s ability to effectively keep celebrities alive beyond the grave is raising questions about public legacies and image rights.
B) 	Late in 2019, it was announced that US actor James Dean, who died in 1955, will star in a Vietnam War film scheduled for release later this year. In the film, which will be called Finding Jach, Dean will be recreated on screen with CGI based on old footage(影片镜头) and photographs, with another actor voicing him. The news was met with excitement by those keen to see Dean digitally brought back to life for only his fourth film, but it also drew sharp criticism. “This is puppeteering the dead for their fame alone,” actress Zelda Williams wrote on Twitter."It sets such an awful precedent for the future of performance.” Her father, Robin Williams, who died in 2014, was keen to avoid the same fate. Before his death, he filed a deed protecting the use of his image until 2039, preventing others from recreating him using CGI to appear in a film.TV show or as a hologram（全息影像）.
C) The James Dean film is a way to keep the actor’s image relevant for younger generations, says Mark Roesler of CMG Worldwide, the firm that represents Dean’s estate. “I think this is the beginning of an entire wave,” says Travis Cloyd, CEO of Worldwide XR, one of the companies behind the digital recreation of Dean. “Moving into the future, we want James Dean to be brought into different gaming environments, or different virtual reality environments, or augmented reality environments,” he says.
D) Other actors have been revived, with the permission of their estates, for advertising purposes: for example, a 2011 advertisement for Dior featured contemporary actress Charlize Theron alongside iconic 20th-century stars Marilyn Monroe, Grace Kelly and Marlene Dietrich.Later, Audrey Hepburn was digitally recreated for a chocolate commercial in 2013. In the same year, a CGI Bruce Lee appeared in a Chinese-language ad for a whisky brand, which offended many fans because Lee was widely known not to drink alcohol at all. “In the last five years, it’s become more affordable and more achievable in a whole movie,” says Tim Webber at UK visual effects firm Framestore, the company behind the Hepburn chocolate ad. Framestore used body doubles with resemblance to Hepburn’s facial structure and body shape as a framework for manual animation. The process was extremely difficult and expensive, says Webber, but the technology has moved on.
E) Now, a person can be animated from scratch. “If they’re alive today,you can put them in scanning rigs, you can get every detail of their body analysed very carefully and that makes it much easier, whereas working from available photographs is tricky,” says Webber, who won an Academy Award for his visual effects work on the 2013 film Grawity. “I also see a lot of actors today who will have the desire to take advantage of this technology: to have their likeness captured and stored for future content,” says Cloyd. “They foresee this being something that could give their estates and give their families the ability to make money from their likeness when they’re gone.”
F）A hidden hazard of digitally recreating a deceased（已故的）celebrity is the risk of damaging their legacy. “We have to respect the security and the integrity of rights holders,” says John Canning at Digital Domain, a US firm that created a hologram of rapper（说唱艺人）Tupac Shakur, which appeared at the Coachella music festival in 2012,15 years after his death.
G) 	Legally, a person’s rights to control the commercial use of their name and image beyond their death differ between and even within countries.In certain US states, for example, these rights are treated similarly to property rights, and are transferable to a person’s heirs. In California, under the Celebrities Rights Act, the personality rights for a celebrity last for 70 years after their death. “We’ve got a societal debate going on about access to our public commons, as it were, about famous faces,” says Lilian Edwards at Newcastle University, UK. Should the public be allowed to use or reproduce images of famous people, given how iconic they are? And what is in the best interest of a deceased person’s legacy may conflict with the desires of their family or the public, says Edwards.
H) 	A recreation, however lifelike, will never be indistinguishable from a real actor, says Webber. “When we are bringing someone back, representing someone who is no longer alive on the screen, what we are doing is extremely sophisticated digital make-up,” he says. “A performance is a lot more than a physical resemblance.” 
I)	As it becomes easier to digitally recreate celebrities and to entirely manufacture on-screen identities, could this kind of technology put actors out of jobs? “I think actors are worried about this,” says Edwards. “But I think it will take a very long time."This is partly because of the risk that viewers find virtual humans scary. Edwards cites widespread backlash to the digital recreation of Carrie Fisher as a young Princess Leia in Rogue One,a trick later repeated in the recent Star Wars: The Rise of Shywalker, which was filmed after Fisher’s death in 2016. “People didn’t like it,” she says. “ They discovered the uncanny valley（诡异谷）.”
J) 	This refers to the idea that when objects trying to resemble humans aren’t quite perfect, they can make viewers feel uneasy because they fall somewhere between obviously non-human and fully human. “That’s always a danger when you’re doing anything human or human-like,” says Webber. “There are a thousand things that could go wrong with a computer-generated facial performance, and any one of those could make it fall into the uncanny valley,” he says. “Your brain just knows there’s something wrong.” The problem often arises around the eyes or mouth, says Webber. “They’re the areas that you look at when you’re talking to someone.”
K)		An unfamiliar digital human that has been created through CGI will also face the same challenge as an unknown actor: they don’t have the appeal of an established name. “You have to spend substantial capital in creating awareness around their likeness and making sure people are familiar with who they are,” says Cloyd. This is now starting to happen. “The way you pre-sell a movie in a foreign market is based on relevant talent,” he says. “I think we’re a long way away from having virtual beings that have the ability to pre-sell content.”
L)	Webber expects that we will see more digital humans on screen. “It’s happening because it can happen,” he says. Referring to a line from Jurassic Parh（侏罗纪公园）, he adds: “People are too	busy thinking about what they can do to think about whether they should do it.”
36. 	There is an ongoing debate among the public as to whether the images of deceased celebrities should be recreated.
37. 	The CGI technology allows the image of the deceased James Dean to be presented to young people in new settings.
38. 	It is very likely that the CGI-recreated image of a deceased celebrity will fail to match the real actor especially in facial expressions.
39. 	The use of digital technology can bring images of deceased celebrities back to the screen.
40. 	Recreating a deceased famous actor or actress may violate their legitimate rights.
41.	More CGI-recreated images of deceased celebrities are expected to appear on screen.
42.	The image of James Dean will be recreated on screen with his voice dubbed by someone else.
43.	However advanced the CGI technology is, the recreated image will differ in a way from the real actor.
44.	A lot of actors today are likely to make use of the CGI technology to have their images stored for	the benefit of their families.
45. 	Some actors are concerned that they may lose jobs because of the CGI technology.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One 
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage. 
　　　You can’t see it, smell it, or hear it, and people disagree on how precisely to define it, or where exactly it comes from. It isn’t a school subject or an academic discipline, but it can be learned. It is a quality that is required of artists, but it is also present in the lives of scientists and entrepreneurs. All of us benefit from it and we thrive mentally and spiritually when we are able to wield it. It is a delicate thing, easily stamped out; in fact, it flourishes most fully when people are playful and childlike. Meanwhile, it works best in conjunction with deep knowledge and expertise. 
　　　This mysterious — but teachable — quality is creativity, the subject of a recently -published report by Durham Commission on Creativity and Education. The report concludes that creativity should not inhabit the school curriculum only as it relates to drama, music,art and other obviously creative subjects, but that creative thinking ought to run through all of school life, infusing（充满）the way humanities and natural sciences are learned. 
　　　The authors, who focus on education in England, offer a number of sensible recommendations, some of which are an attempt to alleviate the uninspiring and fact-based approach to education that has crept into policy in recent years. When children are regarded as vessels to be filled with facts, creativity does not prosper; nor does it when teachers’ sole objective is coaching children towards exams. One suggestion from the commission is a network of teacher-led “creativity collaboratives”, along the lines of existing maths hubs (中心), with the aim of supporting teaching for creativity through the school curriculum.
　　　Nevertheless, it is arts subjects through which creativity can most obviously be fostered. The value placed on them by the independent education sector is clear. One only has to look at the remarkable arts facilities at Britain’s top private schools to comprehend this. But in the state sector the excessive focus on English, maths and science threatens to crush arts subjects; meanwhile, reduced school budgets mean diminishing extracurricular activities. There has been a 28.1％decline instudents taking creative subjects at high schools since 2014, though happily, art and design have seen a recent increase. 
　　　This discrepancy between state and private education is a matter of social justice. It is simply wrong and unfair that most children have a fraction of the access to choirs, orchestras, art studios and drama that their more privileged peers enjoy. As lives are affected by any number of looming challenges—climate crisis, automation in the workplace—humans are going to need creative thinking more than ever. For all of our sakes, creativity in education, and for all, must become a priority. 
46. What do we learn from the passage about creativity? 
　　A) It develops best when people are spiritually prepared. 
　　B) It is most often wielded by scientists and entrepreneurs. 
　　C) It is founded on scientific knowledge and analytical skills. 
　　D) It contributes to intellectual growth but can easily be killed. 
47. What is the conclusion of a recently-published report? 
　　A) Natural sciences should be learned the way humanities courses are. 
　　B) Cultivation of creativity should permeate the entire school curriculum. 
　　C) Art courses should be made compulsory for all students. 
　　D) Students should learn more obviously creative subjects. 
48. What does the report say is detrimental to the fostering of creativity? 
　　A) Alleviation of pressure. 	C) Test-oriented teaching.
　　B) Teacher-led school activities.	D) Independent learning. 
49. What do we learn about the private schools in the UK? 
　　A) They encourage extracurricular activities. 
　　B) They attach great importance to arts education. 
　　C) They prioritize arts subjects over maths and sciences. 
　　D) They cater to students from different family backgrounds. 
50. What should be done to meet the future challenges? 
　　A) Increasing government investment in school education. 
　　B) Narrowing the existing gap between the rich and the poor. 
　　C) Providing all children with equal access to arts education. 
　　D) Focusing on meeting the needs of under-privileged students. 
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Emulating your conversation partner’s actions is a common human behavior classified as “mirroring” and has been known and studied by psychologists for years. We all tend to subconsciously copy gestures of people we like. But why do we act like this? 
　　　As a rule, mirroring means that conversationalists enjoy their communication and that there’s acertain level of agreement between them. The topic of discussion is equally interesting for both and they know their interests meet. 
　　　Repeating someone’s behavior is typical of talented communicators, not always because the person is sympathetic, but because there is a goal to be achieved. This way new idols have been brought to the stage: politicians, celebrities, and other big names. Popular culture makes people want to look popular, and act and speak like popular people. 
　　　Nowadays celebrities steal lyrics from each other and struggle with copyright violation accusations or straightforwardly claim themselves to be the authors, even though all the work was done by other people. 
　　　Among celebrities, it’s trendy nowadays to use their own speech writers as politicians do. The so-called “ghostwriting” can take various forms: books, articles, autobiographies, and even social media posts. 
　　　Who is a true copycat（抄袭者）and who gets copycatted? Sometimes, it is a hard nut to crack without an expert’s help. But new authorship defending methods based on identifying individual writing patterns are already here. Their aim is to protect intellectual property. Using scientific methods, some of them can define authorship with 85％ accuracy. 
　　　Writing is not an easy craft to master. If you want to write like a professional without plagiarism（抄袭), there are a few lessons to learn and the first one is: “Copy from one,it’s plagiarism; copy from two, it’s research.” The correct interpretation of this statement is not about copying, but rather about creating your own style. When you study an author’s writing style, don’t stop on a single one, but explore numerous styles instead. Examine types of sentences they use, pay attention to their metaphors, and focus on stories you feel you could write a pretty cool seguel（续篇）to. 
　　　Imitation is rather paradoxical. As an integral part of learning, it brings about positive changes, making people develop and grow. However, it may do a lot of harm. Copying someone’s thoughts, ideas or inventions is completely unacceptable. It infringes on intellectual property rights of others.
　　　Still, many things we do are about copying others one way or another. So if you want to compliment someone on the work they have done and imitate it,just make sure you do it the right way to avoid committing plagiarism. 
51. What do people tend to do while engaging in a conversation? 
　　A) Repeat what their partners say one way or another. 
　　B) Focus as much as possible on topics of mutual interest. 
　　C) Imitate their partners’ gestures without their knowing it. 
　　D) Observe carefully how their partners make use of gestures. 
52. When does mirroring usually take place in a conversation? 
　　A) When both sides are sympathetic with each other. 
　　B) When both sides have a lot of things in common. 
　　C) When both sides make interesting contributions. 
　　D) When both sides try to seek common ground. 
53. What do we learn about popular culture? 
　　A) It encourages people to imitate. 
　　B) It appeals mostly to big names. 
　　C) It acquaints young people with their idols. 
　　D) It can change people’s mode of cognition. 
54. Why is the saying “copy from two, it’s research” a lesson to learn? 
　　A) It facilitates the creation of one’s own writing style. 
　　B) It helps to protect one’s intellectual property rights. 
　　C) It fosters correct interpretation of professional writing. 
　　D) It enables one to write intriguing sequels to famous stories. 
55. Why does the author say imitation is rather paradoxical? 
　　A) It is liable to different interpretations. 	
　　B) It is by and large a necessary evil.
　　C) It can give rise to endless disputes.  	
　　D) It may do harm as well as good.

　　If you think life is wonderful and expect it to stay that way, then you may have a good chance of living to a ripe old age, at least that is what the findings of a new study suggest.

No one in fashion is surprised that Burberry burnt £28 million of stock
　　A) 	Last week, Burberry’s annual report revealed that £28.6 million worth of stock was burnt last year. The news has left investors and consumers outraged but comes as little surprise to those in the fashion industry.
　　B) The practice of destroying unsold stock, and even rolls of unused fabric, is commonplace for luxury labels. Becoming too widely available at a cheaper price through discount stores discourages full-price sales. Sending products for recycling leaves them vulnerable to being stolen and sold on the black market. Jasmine Bina, CEO of brand strategy agency Concept Bureau explains, “Typically, luxury brands  rally around exclusivity to protect their business interests, namely intellectual property and preservation of brand equity(资产).” She stated she had heard rumors of stock burning but not specific cases until this week.
　　C) 	Another reason for the commonplace practice is a financial incentive for brands exporting goods to America. United States Customs states that if imported  merchandise is unused and destroyed under their supervision, 99% of the duties,   taxes or fees paid on the merchandise may be recovered. It is incredibly difficult to calculate how much dead stock currently goes to waste. While there are incentives to do it, there’s no legal obligation to report it.
　　D) 	A source, who chose to remain anonymous, shared her experience working in a Burberry store in New York in October 2016. “My job was to toss items in boxes so they could be sent to be burned. It was killing me inside because all that leather and  fur went to waste and animals had died for nothing. I couldn’t stay there any longer, their business practices threw me off the roof.” In May this year, Burberry announced it was taking fur out of its catwalk shows and reviewing its use elsewhere in the business. “Even though we asked the management, they refused to give us detailed answers as to why they would do this with their collection,” continued the source, who left her role within two weeks. She has since worked with another high-profile, luxury label.
　　E) 	In an online forum post, which asked if it’s true that Louis Vuitton burned its bags, Ahmed Bouchfaa, who claimed to work for Louis Vuitton, responded that the brand holds sales of old stock for staff members twice a year. Items which have still not sold after several sales are destroyed. “Louis Vuitton doesn’t have public sales. They either sell a product at a given price or discontinue it. This is to make sure that everybody pays the same price for an item ,” he says. He goes on to disclose the strict guidelines around the employee sales: “You may buy gifts for someone, but they track each item, and if your gift ends up online they know who to ask.” One investor commenting on the Burberry figures was reportedly outraged that the unsold goods were not even offered to investors before they were destroyed.
　　F) 	Richemont, who owns several luxury brands, hit the headlines in May for taking back £437 million of watches for destruction in the last two years to avoid marked-down prices. It’s not just luxury brands either. In October last year, a Danish TV show exposed H&M for burning 12 tonnes of unsold clothing since 2013. In a statement, the high street retailer defended itself by saying that the burnt clothing had failed   safety tests: “The products to which the media are referring have been tested in external laboratories. The test results show that one of the products is mold infested and  the other product contains levels of lead that are too high. Those products have  rightly been stopped in accordance with our safety routines.” In March, a report revealed that H&M was struggling with $4.3 billion worth of unsold stock.  The brand told The New York Times that the plan was to reduce prices to move the stock, arguably encouraging consumers to buy and throw away with little thought.
　　G) 	Over-production is perhaps the biggest concern for Burberry. While there has been much outrage at the elitist connotation of burning goods rather than making them affordable, executives at the British fashion house are no doubt struggling to defend how they miscalculated production. The waste has been put down to burning old cosmetic stock to make way for their new beauty range. However, while the value of destroyed stock is up from £26.9 million last year, it’s an even more significant  increase from 2016’s figure of £18.8 million, highlighting that this is an ongoing issue.
　　H) 	In September 2016, Burberry switched to a “see now, buy now” catwalk show format. The move was a switch to leverage on the coverage of their fashion week show  to make stock available immediately to consumers. This is opposed to the traditional format of presenting to the industry, taking orders for production and becoming available in six months, time. While Burberry announced “record-breaking”  online reach and engagement, there has been little evidence to suggest that the strategy has had a significant effect on sales, particularly as the hype(炒作)slows across  the season. In February they made adjustments to the format, dropping some catwalk  items immediately and promising that others would launch in the coming months.
　　I) 	In a statement, Burberry denied that switching to “see now, buy now” has had an impact on waste. A Burberry spokesperson further said, “On the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner. We are always seeking ways to reduce and revalue our waste. This is a core part of our strategy and we have forged partnerships and committed support to innovative organizations to help reach this goal.” 
　　J) 	One such partnership is with Elvis & Kresse, an accessories brand working with reclaimed materials. Co-founder Kresse Wesling said, “Late last year we launched an ambitious five-year partnership with the Burberry Foundation. The main aim of  this is to scale our leather rescue project, starting with off-cuts from the production of Burberry leather goods. We are working tirelessly to expand our solutions and would love to welcome anyone to our workshop to come and see what we are doing.”  At the moment, the partnership only addresses waste at the production stage and not unsold goods.
　　K) 	While these are honorable schemes, it makes it harder for Burberry to defend these latest figures. Fifteen years ago, Burberry was at crisis point as their signature check pattern was widely imitated by cheap, imitation brands. It deterred luxury consumers who found their expensive clothing more closely associated with working-class youth culture than a prestigious heritage fashion house. In the year 2004, at the height of over-exposure of the Burberry check, the brand’s turnover was £715.5 million.  Under Christopher Bailey as creative director they turned the brand around and this past year revenue hit £2.73 billion.
　　L) 	Bina believes that brands need to readdress their exclusivity tactic. “Exclusivity is starting to be challenged,” she says, “I think that goes hand in hand with how  luxury itself is being challenged. Access to fashion, and the brands who police it,  are becoming less and less relevant. Things like health, enlightenment, and social and environmental responsibility are the new luxuries. These all come from within, not without. That’s the challenge that traditional luxury brands will have to contend with in the mid-to long-term future.” 
　　36. Burberry’s executives are trying hard to attribute their practice of destroying old products to miscalculated production. 
　　37. Selling products at a discount will do greater harm to luxury brands than destroying them. 
　　38. Imitated Burberry products discouraged luxury consumers from buying its genuine products. 
　　39. Staff members of a luxury brand may buy its old stock at cheaper prices, but they are not allowed to resell them. 
　　40. In future traditional luxury brands will have to adapt their business strategies to the changing concepts of luxury. 
　　41. One luxury brand employee quit her job because she simply couldn’t bear to see the destruction of unsold products. 
　　42. Destroying old stock is a practice not just of luxury brands but of less prestigious fashion brands. 
　　43. Burberry is working with a partner to make full use of leather materials to reduce waste. 
　　44. Burberry’s plan to destroy its unsold products worth millions of dollars aroused public indignation. 
　　45. Burberry’s change of marketing strategy to make a product available as soon as consumers see it on the fashion show did not turn out to be as effective as expected.
Section C
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　Social media is absolutely everywhere. Billions of people use social media on a daily basis to create, share, and exchange ideas, messages, and information.

It is a powerful communication medium that simultaneously provides immediate, frequent, permanent, and wide-reaching information across the globe.
　　People post their lives on social media for the world to see. Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln, and countless other social channels provide a quick and simple way to glimpse into a job candidate’s personal life—both the positive and negative sides of it. Social media screening is tempting to use as part of the hiring process, but should employers make use of it when researching a potential candidate’s background?
　　Incorporating the use of social media to screen job candidates is not an uncommon practice. A 2018 survey found that almost 70% of employers use social media to screen candidates before hiring them. But there are consequences and potential legal risks involved too. When done inappropriately, social media screening can be considered Unethical or even illegal.
　　Social media screening is essentially scrutinising a job candidate’s private life. It can reveal information about protected characteristics like age, race, nationality, disability, gender, religion, etc., and that could bias a hiring decision. Pictures or comments on a private page that are taken out of context could ruin a perfectly good candidate’s chances  of getting hired. This process could potentially give an unfair advantage to one candidate over another. It creates an unequal playing field and potentially provides hiring managers with information that can impact their hiring decision in a negative way.
　　It’s hard to ignore social media as a screening tool. While there are things that you shouldn’t see, there are some things that can be lawfully considered—making it a valuable source of relevant information too. Using social media screening appropriately can help ensure that you don’t hire a toxic employee who will cost you money or stain your company’s reputation. Consider the lawful side of this process and you may be able to hire the best employee ever. There is a delicate balance.
　　Screening job candidates on social media must be done professionally and responsibly. Companies should stipulate that they will never ask for passwords, be consistent, document decisions, consider the source used and be aware that other laws may apply. In light of this it is probably best to look later in the process and ask human resources for help in navigating it. Social media is here to stay. But before using social media to screen job candidates, consulting with management and legal teams beforehand is essential in order to comply with all laws.
46. What does the author mainly discuss in the passage?
　　A) The advantage of using social media in screening job candidates.
　　B) The potentially invasive nature of social media in everyday life.
　　C) Whether the benefits of social media outweigh the drawbacks.
　　D) Whether social media should be used to screen job candidates. 
47. What might happen when social media is used to screen job candidates?
　　A) Moral or legal issues might arise.
　　B) Company reputation might suffer.
　　C) Sensational information might surface.

　　B) When it is scrutinised by an employer.
　　C) When it is magnified to a ruinous degree.
　　D) When it is revealed to the human resources. 
49. How can employers use social media information to their advantage while avoiding unnecessary risks?
　　A) By tipping the delicate balance.
　　B) By using it in a legitimate way.
　　C) By keeping personal information on record.
　　D) By separating relevant from irrelevant data. 
50. What does the author suggest doing before screening job candidates on social media?

　　B) Anticipating potential risks involved in the process.
　　C) Seeking advice from management and legal experts.
　　D) Stipulating a set of rules for asking specific questions.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　In recent years, the food industry has increased its use of labels. Whether the labels say ‘non-GMO (非转基因的)’ or ‘no sugar,’ or ‘zero carbohydrates’, consumers are increasingly demanding more information about what’s in their food. One report found that 39 percent of consumers would switch from the brands they currently buy to others that provide clearer, more accurate product information. Food manufacturers are responding to the report with new labels to meet that demand, and they’re doing so with an eye towards giving their products an advantage over the competition, and bolstering profits.
　　This strategy makes intuitive sense. If consumers say they want transparency, tell them exactly what is in your product. That is simply supplying a certain demand. But the marketing strategy in response to this consumer demand has gone beyond articulating what is in a product, to labeling what is NOT in the food. These labels are known as “absence claims” labels, and they represent an emerging labeling trend that is detrimental both to the consumers who purchase the products and the industry that supplies them.
　　For example, Hunt’s put a “non-GMO” label on its canned crushed tomatoes a few years ago—despite the fact that at the time there was no such thing as a GMO tomato on the market. Some dairy companies are using the “non-GMO” label on their milk, despite the fact that all milk is naturally GMO-free, another label that creates unnecessary fear around food.
　　While creating labels that play on consumer fears and misconceptions about their food may give a company a temporary marketing advantage over competing products on the grocery aisle, in the long term this strategy will have just the opposite effect: by injecting fear into the discourse about our food, we run the risk of eroding consumer trust in not just a single product, but the entire food business. 
　　Eventually, it becomes a question in consumers, minds: Were these foods ever safe? By purchasing and consuming these types of products, have I already done some kind of harm to my family or the planet?
　　For food manufacturers, it will mean damaged consumer trust and lower sales for everyone. And this isn’t just supposition. A recent study found that absence claims labels can create a stigma around foods even when there is no scientific evidence that they cause harm.
　　It’s clear that food manufacturers must tread carefully when it comes to using absence claims. In addition to the likely negative long-term impact on sales, this verbal trick sends a message that innovations in farming and food processing are unwelcome, eventually leading to less efficiency, fewer choices for consumers, and ultimately, more costly food products. If we allow this kind of labeling to continue, we will all lose. 
　　
51. What trend has been observed in a report?
　　A) Food manufacturers, rising awareness of product safety.
　　B) Food manufacturers, changing strategies to bolster profits.
　　C) Consumers, growing demand for eye-catching food labels.
　　D) Consumers, increasing desire for clear product information. 
52. What does the author say is manufacturers’ new marketing strategy?
　　A) Stressing the absence of certain elements in their products.
　　B) Articulating the unique nutritional value of their products.
　　C) Supplying detailed information of their products.
　　D) Designing transparent labels for their products. 
53. What point does the author make about non-GMO labels?
　　A) They are increasingly attracting customers’ attention.
　　B) They create lots of trouble for GMO food producers.
　　C) They should be used more for vegetables and milk.
　　D) They cause anxiety about food among consumers. 
54. What does the author say absence claims labels will do to food manufacturers?
　　A) Cause changes in their marketing strategies.
　　B) Help remove stigma around their products.
　　C) Erode consumer trust and reduce sales.
　　D) Decrease support from food scientists. 
55. What does the author suggest food manufacturers do?
　　A) Take measures to lower the cost of food products.
　　B) Exercise caution about the use of absence claims.
　　C) Welcome new innovations in food processing.
　　D) Promote efficiency and increase food variety.

Part Ⅲ	Reading Comprehension	(40 minutes)
Section A（淘宝店铺：光速考研工作室）
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
　　According to psychologist Sharon Draper, our clothing choices can absolutely affect our well-being. When we wear ill-fitting clothes, or feel over- or under-dressed for an event, it’s natural to feel self-conscious or even stressed. Conversely, she says, opting for clothes that fit well and  				26		  	with your sense of style can improve your confidence.
　　But can you improve your health through your  27					 							 clothing, without having to dash out and buy a whole new	 							28 							 	? “Absolutely,” says Draper. If your goal is to improve your thinking, she recommends picking clothes that fit well and are unlikely to encourage restlessness, so, avoid bows, ties and unnecessary	 								29  . It also helps to opt for clothes you	  30				  	as tying in with your goals, so, if you want to perform better at work, select pieces you view as professional. Draper says this fits in with the concept of behavioral activation, whereby	 									31 												in a behavior (in this case, selecting clothes) can set you on the path to then achieving your goals (working harder).
　　Another way to improve your	 									32  	of mind is to mix things up. Draper says we often feel stuck in a rut (常规) if we wear the same clothes—even if they’re our favorites—thus opting for an item you don’t wear often, or adding something different to an outfit, such as a hat, can 											33							 				shift your mood. On days when you’re really	 							34			 									 	to brave the world, Draper suggests selecting sentimental items of clothing, such as ones you wore on a special day, or given to you by a loved one, as clothes with   35   associations can help you tap into constructive emotions.
　　A) accessories B) align C) concurrently  D) current  E) engaging  F) fond  G) frame  H) locations   
　　I) perceive   J) positively  K) profile  L) prospering  M) reluctant  N) showcase  O) wardrobe
Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Do music lessons really make children smarter?
　　A) 	A recent analysis found that most research mischaracterizes the relationship between music and skills enhancement.
　　B) 	In 2004, a paper appeared in the journal Psychological Science, titled “Music Lessons Enhance IQ.” The author, composer and psychologist Glenn Schellenberg had conducted an experiment with 144 children randomly assigned to four groups: one learned the keyboard for a year, one took singing lessons, one joined an acting class, and a control group had no extracurricular training. The IQ of the children in the two musical groups rose by an average of seven points in the course of a year; those in the other two groups gained an average of 4.3 points.
　　C) 	Schellenberg had long been skeptical of the science supporting claims that music education enhances children’s abstract reasoning, math, or language skills. If children who play the piano are smarter, he says, it doesn’t necessarily mean they are smarter because they play the piano. It could be that the youngsters who play the piano also happen to be more ambitious or better at focusing on a task. Correlation, after all, does not prove causation.
　　D) 	The 2004 paper was specifically designed to address those concerns. And as a passionate musician, Schellenberg was delighted when he turned up credible evidence that music has transfer effects on general intelligence. But nearly a decade later, in 2013, the Education Endowment Foundation funded a bigger study with more than 900 students. That study failed to confirm Schellenberg’s findings, producing no evidence that music lessons improved math and literacy skills.
　　E) 	Schellenberg took that news in stride while continuing to cast a skeptical eye on the research in his field. Recently, he decided to formally investigate just how often his fellow researchers in psychology and neuroscience make what he believes are erroneous—or at least premature—causal connections between music and intelligence. His results, published in May, suggest that many of his peers do just that.
　　F) 	For his recent study, Schellenberg asked two research assistants to look for correlational studies on the effects of music education. They found a total of 114 papers published since 2000. To assess whether the authors claimed any causation, researchers then looked for telltale verbs in each paper’s title and abstract, verbs like “enhance,” “promote,” “facilitate,” and “strengthen.” The papers were categorized as neuroscience if the study employed a brain imaging method like magnetic resonance, or if the study appeared in a journal that had “brain,” “neuroscience,” or a related term in its title. Otherwise the papers were categorized as psychology. Schellenberg didn’t tell his assistants what exactly he was trying to prove.
　　G) 	After computing their assessments, Schellenberg concluded that the majority of the articles erroneously claimed that music training had a causal effect. The overselling,  he also found, was more prevalent among neuroscience studies, three quarters of which mischaracterized a mere association between music training and skills enhancement  as a cause-and-effect relationship. This may come as a surprise to some. Psychologists have been battling charges that they don’t do “real” science for some time—in large part because many findings from classic experiments have proved unreproducible. Neuroscientists, on the other hand, armed with brain scans and EEGs (脑电图), have not been subject to the same degree of critique.
　　H) 	To argue for a cause-and-effect relationship, scientists must attempt to explain why and how a connection could occur. When it comes to transfer effects of music,     scientists frequently point to brain plasticity—the fact that the brain changes according to how we use it. When a child learns to play the violin, for example, several studies have shown that the brain region responsible for the fine motor skills of the left   hand’s fingers is likely to grow. And many experiments have shown that musical training improves certain hearing capabilities, like filtering voices from background noise or distinguishing the difference between the consonants (辅音) ‘b’ and ‘g’ .
　　I) 	But Schellenberg remains highly critical of how the concept of plasticity has been applied in his field. “Plasticity has become an industry of its own,” he wrote in his May paper. Practice does change the brain, he allows, but what is questionable is the assertion that these changes affect other brain regions, such as those responsible for spatial reasoning or math problems.
　　J) 	Neuropsychologist Lutz Jancke agrees. “Most of these studies don’t allow for causal inferences,” he said. For over two decades, Jancke has researched the effects of music lessons, and like Schellenberg, he believes that the only way to truly understand their effects is to run longitudinal studies. In such studies, researchers would need to follow groups of children with and without music lessons over a long period of time—even if the assignments are not completely random. Then they could compare outcomes for each group.
　　K) 	Some researchers are starting to do just that. The neuroscientist Peter Schneider from Heidelberg University in Germany, for example, has been following a group of children for ten years now. Some of them were handed musical instruments and given lessons through a school-based program in the Ruhr region of Germany called Jedem Kind ein Instrument, or “an instrument for every child,” which was carried out with government funding. Among these children, Schneider has found that those who were enthusiastic about music and who practiced voluntarily showed improvements in hearing ability,  as well as in more general competencies, such as the ability to concentrate.
　　L) To establish whether effects such as improved concentration are caused by music participation itself, and not by investing time in an extracurricular activity of any kind, Assal Habibi, a psychology professor at the University of Southern California,  is conducting a five-year longitudinal study with children from low-income communities in Los Angeles. The youngsters fall into three groups: those who take after-school music, those who do after-school sports, and those with no structured after-school program at all. After two years, Habibi and her colleagues reported seeing structural changes in the brains of the musically trained children, both locally and in the pathways connecting different parts of the brain.
　　M) 	That may seem compelling, but Habibi’s children were not selected randomly. Did the children who were drawn to music perhaps have something in them from the start that made them different but eluded the brain scanners? “As somebody who started taking piano lessons at the age of five and got up every morning at seven to practice, that experience changed me and made me part of who I am today,” Schellenberg said.  “The question is whether those kinds of experiences do so systematically across individuals and create exactly the same changes. And I think that is that huge leap of faith.”
　　N) 	Did he have a hidden talent that others didn’t have? Or more endurance than his peers? Music researchers tend, like Schellenberg, to be musicians themselves, and as he noted in his recent paper, “the idea of positive cognitive and neural side effects from music training (and other pleasurable activities) is inherently appealing.” He also admits that if he had children of his own, he would encourage them to take music lessons and go to university. “I would think that it makes them better people, more critical, just wiser in general,” he said.
　　O) 	But those convictions should be checked at the entrance to the lab, he added. Otherwise, the work becomes religion or faith. “You have to let go of your faith if you want to be a scientist.”
　　36. Glenn Schellenberg’s latest research suggests many psychologists and neuroscientists wrongly believe in the causal relationship between music and IQ. 
　　37. 	The belief in the positive effects of music training appeals to many researchers who are musicians themselves.
　　38. Glenn Schellenberg was doubtful about the claim that music education helps enhance children’s intelligence. 
　　39. Glenn Schellenberg came to the conclusion that most of the papers assessed made the wrong claim regarding music’s effect on intelligence. 
　　40. You must abandon your unverified beliefs before you become a scientist. 
　　41. Lots of experiments have demonstrated that people with music training can better differentiate certain sounds. 
　　42. Glenn Schellenberg’s findings at the beginning of this century were not supported by a larger study carried out some ten years later. 
　　43. One researcher shares Glenn Schellenberg’ view that it is necessary to conduct long-term developmental studies to understand the effects of music training. 
　　44. Glenn Schellenberg’s research assistants had no idea what he was trying to prove in his new study. 
　　45. Glenn Schellenberg admits that practice can change certain areas of the brain but doubts that the change can affect other areas.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　The trend toward rationality and enlightenment was endangered long before the advent of the World Wide Web. As Neil Postman noted in his 1985 book Amusing Ourselves to Death, the rise of television introduced not just a new medium but a new discourse:  a gradual shift from a typographic(印刷的)culture to a photographic one, which in turn meant a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment. In an image-centered and pleasure-driven world, Postman noted, there is no place for rational thinking, because you simply cannot think with images. It is text that enables us to “uncover lies, confusions and overgeneralizations, and to detect abuses of logic and common sense. It also means to weigh ideas, to compare and contrast assertions, to connect one generalization to another.”
　　The dominance of television was not confined to our living rooms. It overturned all of those habits of mind, fundamentally changing our experience of the world, affecting the conduct of politics, religion, business, and culture. It reduced many aspects of modern life to entertainment, sensationalism, and commerce. “Americans don’t talk to each other,   we entertain each other,” Postman wrote. “They don’t exchange ideas, they exchange images. They do not argue with propositions, they argue with good looks, celebrities and commercials.” 
　　At first, the web seemed to push against this trend. When it emerged towards the end of the 1980s as a purely text-based medium, it was seen as a tool to pursue knowledge,  not pleasure. Reason and thought were most valued in this garden—all derived from the project of the Enlightenment. Universities around the world were among the first to connect to this new medium, which hosted discussion groups, informative personal or group blogs, electronic magazines, and academic mailing lists and forums. It was an intellectual project, not about commerce or control, created in a scientific research center in Switzerland.   And for more than a decade, the web created an alternative space that threatened television’s grip on society.
　　Social networks, though, have since colonized the web for television’s values.   From Facebook to Instagram, the medium refocuses our attention on videos and images, rewarding emotional appeals—‘like’ buttons—over rational ones. Instead of a quest	for knowledge, it engages us in an endless zest(热情)for instant approval from an audience, for which we are constantly but unconsciously performing. ( It’s telling that, while Google began life as a PhD thesis, Facebook started as a tool to judge classmates, appearances.)		It reduces our curiosity by showing us exactly what we already want and think, based on our profiles and preferences. The Enlightenment’s motto(座右铭)of ‘Dare to know’ has become ‘Dare not to care to know.’ 
46. What did Neil Postman say about the rise of television?
　　A) It initiated a change from dominance of reason to supremacy of pleasure.
　　B) It brought about a gradual shift from cinema going to home entertainment.
　　C) It started a revolution in photographic technology.
　　D) It marked a new age in the entertainment industry. 
47. According to the passage, what is the advantage of text reading?
　　A) It gives one access to huge amounts of information.  B) It allows more information to be processed quickly.  
　　 C) It is capable of enriching one’s life.     D) It is conducive to critical thinking. 
48. How has television impacted Americans?
　　A) It has given them a lot more to argue about.
　　B) It has brought celebrities closer to their lives.
　　C) It has made them care more about what they say.
　　D) It has rendered their interactions more superficial. 
49. What does the passage say about the World Wide Web?
　　A) It was developed primarily for universities worldwide.
　　B) It was created to connect people in different countries.
　　C) It was viewed as a means to quest for knowledge.
　　D) It was designed as a discussion forum for university students. 
50. What do we learn about users of social media?
　　A) They are bent on looking for an alternative space for escape.
　　B) They are constantly seeking approval from their audience.
　　C) They are forever engaged in hunting for new information.
　　D) They are unable to focus their attention on tasks for long.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　According to a recent study, a small but growing proportion of the workforce is affected to some degree by a sense of entitlement. Work is less about what they can contribute but more about what they can take. It can lead to workplace dysfunction and diminish their own job satisfaction. Fm not referring to employees who are legitimately dissatisfied with their employment conditions due to, say, being denied fair pay or flexible work practices. I’m talking about those who consistently believe they deserve special treatment and generous rewards. It’s an expectation that exists irrespective of their abilities or levels of performance.
　　As a result of that discrepancy between the privileges they feel they’re owed and their inflated sense of self-worth, they don’t work as hard for their employer. They prefer instead to slack off. It’s a tendency which many scholars believe begins in childhood due to parents who overindulge their kids. This thereby leads them to expect the same kind of spoilt treatment throughout their adult lives. And yet despite how these employees feel,  it’s obviously important for their manager to nonetheless find out how to keep them motivated. And, by virtue of that heightened motivation, to perform well.
　　The research team from several American universities surveyed more than 240 individuals. They sampled managers as well as team members. Employee entitlement was measured by statements such as “I honestly feel I’m just more deserving than others.”  The respondents had to rate the extent of their agreement. Employee engagement, meanwhile, was assessed with statements like “I really throw myself into my work.”	The findings revealed ethical leadership is precisely what alleviates the negative effects of employee entitlement. That’s because rather than indulging employees or neglecting them, ethical leaders communicate very direct and clear expectations. They also hold employees accountable for their behaviors and are genuinely committed to doing the right thing. Additionally, these leaders are consistent in their standards. They’re also less likely to deviate in how they treat employees.
　　This means, when confronted by an entitled team member, an ethical leader is significantly disinclined to accommodate their demands. He or she will instead point out, constructively and tactfully, exactly how their inflated sense of deservingness is somewhat distorted. They’d then go further to explain the specific, and objective, criteria the employee must meet to receive their desired rewards. This shift away from unrealistic expectations is successful because entitled employees feel more confident that ethical leaders will deliver on their promises. This occurs because they’re perceived to be fair and trustworthy.
　　The researchers, however, exercise caution by warning no one single response is the perfect remedy. But there’s no denying ethical leadership is at least a critical step in the right direction.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2.
Why facts don’t change our minds 
　　A) 	The economist J. K. Galbraith once wrote, “Faced with a choice between changing one’s mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy with the proof.” 
　　B) 	Leo Tolstoy was even bolder: “The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already； but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of a doubt, what is laid before him.” 
　　C) 	What’s going on here? Why don’t facts change our minds? And why would someone continue to believe a false or inaccurate idea anyway? How do such behaviors serve us? Humans need a reasonably accurate view of the world in order to survive. If your model of reality is wildly different from the actual world, then you struggle to take effective actions each day. However, truth and accuracy are not the only things that matter to the human mind. Humans also seem to have a deep desire to belong.
　　D) 	In Atomic Habits, I wrote, “Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, our ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a death sentence.”
　　E) 	Understanding the truth of a situation is important, but so is remaining part of a tribe. While these two desires often work well together, they occasionally come into conflict. In many circumstances, social connection is actually more helpful to your daily life than understanding the truth of a particular fact or idea. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker put it this way, “People are embraced or condemned according to their beliefs, so one function of the mind may be to hold beliefs that bring the belief- holder the greatest number of allies, protectors, or disciples (信徒), rather than beliefs that are most likely to be true.”
　　F) 	We don’t always believe things because they are correct. Sometimes we believe things because they make us look good to the people we care about. I thought Kevin Simler put it well when he wrote, “If a brain anticipates that it will be rewarded for adopting a particular belief, it’s perfectly happy to do so, and doesn’t much care where the reward comes from- whether it’s pragmatic (实用主义的) (better outcomes resulting from better decisions), social (better treatment from one’s peers), or some mix of the two.” 
　　G) 	False beliefs can be useful in a social sense even if they are not useful in a factual sense. For lack of a better phrase, we might call this approach “factually false, but socially accurate.” When we have to choose between the two, people often select friends and family over facts. This insight not only explains why we might hold our tongue at a dinner party or look the other way when our parents say something offensive, but also reveals a better way to change the minds of others.
　　H) 	Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of convincing them to change their tribe. If they abandon their beliefs, they run the risk of losing social ties. You can’t expect someone to change their mind if you take away their community too. You have to give them somewhere to go. Nobody wants their worldview torn apart if loneliness is the outcome.
　　I) 	The way to change people’s minds is to become friends with them, to integrate them into your tribe, to bring them into your circle. Now, they can change their beliefs without the risk of being abandoned socially.
　　J) 	Perhaps it is not difference, but distance, that breeds tribalism and hostility. As proximity increases, so does understanding. l am reminded of Abraham Lincoln’s quote, “I don’t like that man. I must get to know him better.”
　　K)	Facts don’t change our minds. Friendship does. Years ago, Ben Casnocha mentioned an idea to me that I haven’t been able to shake: The people who are most likely to change our minds are the ones we agree with on 98 percent of topics. If someone you know, like, and trust believes a radical idea, you are more likely to give it merit, weight, or consideration. You already agree with them in most areas of life. Maybe you should change your mind on this one too. But if someone wildly different than you proposes the same radical idea, well, it’s easy to dismiss them as nuts.
　　L) 	One way to visualize this distinction is by mapping beliefs on a spectrum. If you divide this spectrum into 10 units and you find yourself at Position 7, then there is little sense in trying to convince someone at Position 1. The gap is too wide. When you’re at Position 7, your time is better spent connecting with people who are at Positions 6 and 8, gradually pulling them in your direction.
　　M) The most heated arguments often occur between people on opposite ends of the spectrum, but the most frequent learning occurs from people who are nearby. The closer you are to someone, the more likely it becomes that the one or two beliefs you don’t share will bleed over into your own mind and shape your thinking. The further away an idea is from your current position, the more likely you are to reject it outright. When it comes to changing people’s minds, it is very difficult to jump from one side to another. You can’t jump down the spectrum. You have to slide down it.
　　N) 	Any idea that is sufficiently different from your current worldview will feel threatening. And the best place to ponder a threatening idea is in a non-threatening environment.  As a result, books are often a better vehicle for transforming beliefs than conversations or debates. In conversation, people have to carefully consider their status and appearance. They want to save face and avoid looking stupid. When confronted with an uncomfortable set of facts, the tendency is often to double down on their current position rather than publicly admit to being wrong. Books resolve this tension. With a book, the conversation takes place inside someone’s head and without the risk of being judged by others. It’s easier to be open-minded when you aren’t feeling defensive.
　　O) 	There is another reason bad ideas continue to live on, which is that people continue to talk about them.Silence is death for any idea. An idea that is never spoken or written down dies with the person who conceived it. Ideas can only be remembered when they are repeated. They can only be believed when they are repeated. I have already pointed out that people repeat ideas to signal they are part of the same social group. But here’s a crucial point most people miss: People also repeat bad ideas when they complain about them. Before you can criticize an idea, you have to reference that idea. You end up repeating the ideas you’re hoping people will forget—but, of course, people can’t forget them because you keep talking about them. The more you repeat a bad idea, the more likely people are to believe it.
　　P) 	Let’s call this phenomenon Clear’s Law of Recurrence: The number of people who believe an idea is directly proportional to the number of times it has been repeated during the last year—even if the idea is false. 
36. 	According to the author, humans can hardly survive if separated from their community. 
37. 	People often accept false beliefs because they prioritize social bonds rather than facts. 
38. 	Most often people learn from those close to them. 
39. 	Sometimes people adopt certain beliefs in order to leave a favorable impression on those dear to them. 
40. 	Compared with face-to-face communication, books often provide a better medium for changing people’s beliefs.
41. 	On many occasions in daily life, people benefit more from their social bonds than from knowing the truth.
42. 	If you want to change somebody’s beliefs, you should first establish social connection with them. 
43. 	Humans cannot survive without a fair knowledge of the actual world. 
44. 	Repetition of bad ideas increases their chances of being accepted. 
45. 	Nobody is willing to give up their beliefs at the risk of getting isolated.
Section C
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　The subject of automation and its role in our economy has taken hold in American public discourse. Technology broadly and automation specifically are dramatically reshaping the way we work. And we need to have a plan for what’s still to come.
　　We don’t have to look further than our own communities to see the devastating impact of automation. From automated warehouses to cashierless grocery stores to neighborhood libraries that offer self-checkout lanes instead of employing real people—automation is increasingly replacing jobs and leaving too few good new jobs behind.
　　The statistics in manufacturing are staggering. Despite the widespread fears about trade, a recent report showed that just 13 percent of jobs lost in manufacturing are due to trade—the rest of the losses have been due to advances in technology.
　　That is why more people are criticizing the ever-increasing role of technology in our economy. Our country is manufacturing more than ever before, but we are doing it with fewer workers. However, it’s not just factories that are seeing losses—software and information technology are also having a dramatic impact on jobs most people think are secure from the forces of a rapidly-changing economy. Something transformative is happening in America that is having an adverse effect on American families. Whether policymakers and politicians admit it or not, workers have made clear their feelings about their economic insecurity and desire to keep good jobs in America.
　　So why are people so insistent on ignoring the perils of automation? They are failing to look ahead at a time when planning for the future is more important than ever.  Resisting automation is futile: it is as inevitable as industrialization was before it.  I sincerely hope that those who assert that automation will make us more effective and pave the way for new occupations are right, but the reality of automation’s detrimental effects on workers makes me skeptical. No one can currently say where the new jobs are coming from or when, and any sensible company or country should prepare for all alternatives.
　　I’m not overstating the danger: look at what’s happened to the labor force.  According to economic research, one in six working-age men, 25 — 54, doesn’t have a job.  Fifty years ago, nearly 100 percent of men that age were working. Women’s labor force participation, meanwhile, has slipped back to the level it was at in the late 1980s.
　　American families and prominent business leaders are aware that there’s a big problem with automation. The value of a college degree is diminishing, and our upward mobility is declining. If we want an economy that allows everyone to be economically secure, we need to start thinking about how we can rightfully address automation. 
46. What can we observe from the author’s description of our communities?
　　A) The growing passion for automation.          B) The shift from manual jobs to IT ones.
　　C) Their changing views on employment.					D) Their fading employment opportunities. 
47. What do we learn from a recent report?
　　A) The manufacturing sector is declining at a fast rate.
　　B) The concerns about the effect of trade are exaggerated.
　　C) The fears about trade have been spreading far and wide.
　　D) The impact of trade on employment has been staggering. 
48. What does the passage tell us about American workers in an era of transformation?
　　A) They feel ignored by politicians. 
　　B) They feel increasingly vulnerable.
　　C) They keep adapting to the changes.
　　D) They keep complaining but to no avail.
49. What does the author think of automation?
　　A) It will have the same impact as industrialization.
　　B) It provides sensible companies with alternatives.
　　C) Its alleged positive effects are doubtful.
　　D) Its detrimental effects are unavoidable. 
50. What should we attach importance to when dealing with automation?
　　A) College graduates’ job prospects. 	C) People’s economic security.
　　B) Women’s access to employment. 	D) People’s social mobility.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　Look at the people around you. Some are passive, others more aggressive. Some work best alone, others crave companionship. We easily recognize that there is great variation among the individuals who live near us. Yet, when we speak of people from elsewhere, we seem to inevitably characterize them based on their country of origin.
　　Statistics specialists, when they speak of national averages, often make the same mistake.
　　Newly published research shows how erroneous such overviews are. Three researchers analyzed decades of values-based surveys and found that only between 16% and 21% of the variation in cultural values could be explained by differences between countries. In other words, the vast majority of what makes us culturally distinct from one another has nothing to do with our homeland.
　　To determine what factors really are associated with culture, the authors combined data from 558 prior surveys that each measured one or more of Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. These are traits, such as individualism and masculinity, that describe work-related cultural values. (They are not a measure of visible cultural traits, such as food or dress.) Though the validity of Hofstede’s dimensions has been questioned, they have the singular benefit of having been in use for decades, which allows for historical and international comparisons.
　　The researchers found that both demographic factors, such as age, and environmental factors, such as long-term unemployment rates, were more correlated with cultural values than nationality. Occupation and social economic status were the most strongly correlated, suggesting that our values are more economically driven than we usually give them credit for.
　　The evidence implies that people with similar jobs and incomes are more culturally alike, regardless of where they live. Vas Taras, the lead author of the study, puts it this way: “Tell me how much you make and I will make a pretty accurate prediction about your cultural values. Tell me what your nationality is and I probably will make a wrong prediction.”
　　Taras says our erroneous belief that countries are cultures has caused businesses to teach their employees useless or even harmful ways of interacting with their international peers. Chinese and American lawyers might be trained to interact based on the assumption that the Chinese person is less individualistic, even though their similar social economic situations make it probable they are actually quite alike in that regard.
　　The country, as the unit of authority, is often a convenient way of generalizing about a population.
　　However, our focus on countries can mask broad variations within them. In the majority of cases we would be better off identifying people by the factors that constrain their lives, like income, rather than by the lines surrounding them on a map.
　　
51. What error do experts often make when describing people from other places?
　　A) They tend to overly rely on nationality.
　　B) They often exaggerate their differences.
　　C) They often misunderstand their cultures.
　　D) They tend to dwell on national averages. 
52. What do we learn about Hofstede’s cultural dimensions?
　　A) They are useful in comparing cultural values across time and space.
　　B) They have brought unusual benefits to people of different cultures.
　　C) They are widely used to identify people’s individual traits.
　　D) They provide valuable questions for researchers to study. 
53. What did researchers find about previous studies on factors determining people’s values?
　　A) Environmental factors were prioritized over other factors.
　　B) An individual’s financial status was often underestimated.
　　C) Too much emphasis had been placed on one’s occupation.
　　D) The impact of social progress on one’s values was ignored. 
54. What is the impact on employees when cultures are identified with countries?
　　A) They may fail to see the cultural biases of their business partners.
　　B) They may fail to attach sufficient importance to cultural diversity.
　　C) They may not be taught how to properly interact with overseas partners.
　　D) They may not be able to learn the legal procedures for business transactions. 
55. What does the author suggest at the end of the passage?
　　A) There is sufficient reason to generalize about a country’s population.
　　B) The majority of people are still constrained by their national identity.
　　C) It is arguable that the country should be regarded as the unit of authority.
　　D) Nationality is less useful than socio-economic status as an indicator of one’s values.

　　　The city of Bath was founded by the Romans almost two thousand years ago. It has been famous for its   26   pleasing architecture and healing thermal springs ever since.
　　　There are three hot springs in Bath; one is the King’s Spring, upon which the Roman Baths and a temple were   			27  . The other two are the Cross Spring and the Hetling Spring, close to each other in Hot Bath Street. Although Bath is   28   known as a Roman and Georgian city, many people came in the intervening centuries to make use of the   29   waters.
　　　While the Georgians made ‘taking the waters’ or bathing particularly fashionable, it was   30   generations who paved the way, creating greater interest in Bath and its springs. Charles II , desperate for an heir and unable to produce a   31   son, came to Bath to take the waters in the hope that their magical powers would do something to   32							 the situation. Craving for a male heir, James and Mary both came to Bath and soon after produced a son, which bred many conspiracy theories about who was the real father of their 	  33  . Regardless, the ‘miracle’ created something of a boom in tourism for Bath and once Queen Anne had paid a visit in 1702, sealing it as the place to be, the whole    nation   34   to the city.

The Doctor Will Skype You Now 
A) 	Fazila is a young woman that has been dealing with eczema (湿疹)	, a common skin condition, for the past five years, but never got it treated. The nearest hospital is an hour away, by boat and bus, and her skin condition didn’t seem serious enough to make the trek, so she ignored it—until a new technology brought the doctor to her. Fazila lives on one of the remote river islands in northern Bangladesh. These islands are low-lying, temporary sand islands that are continuously formed and destroyed through sand buildup and erosion. They are home to over six million people, who face repeated displacement from flooding and erosion—which may be getting worse because of climate change—and a range of health risks, including poor nutrition, malaria (疟疾) and other water-borne diseases.
B)	The most dangerous thing for these remote island dwellers is land erosion. The second is lack of access to medical supplies and doctors. There are no doctors within miles, and while child mortality and maternal death have gone down in the rest of the country, this is not the case for the islands. The medical situation is so bad that it really takes away from the quality of their life. Yet for many island inhabitants—some of Bangladesh’s poorest—paying for health care is a costly ordeal. Victims of erosion lose their houses, agricultural land and jobs as farmers, fishermen and day laborers. Though government hospitals are free, many people hesitate to go, citing long commutes, endless lines and questionable diagnoses. For convenience’s sake, one-third of rural households visit unqualified village doctors, who rely on unscientific methods of treatment, according to a 2016 study in the peer-reviewed journal Global Health Action.
C) On the islands, there’s even a colloquial (口头的) expression for the idea of making medical care your lowest priority: It’s known as “rog pushai rakha” in Bengali, which roughly translates to “stockpiling their diseases”—waiting to seek medical attention until a condition becomes extremely serious. Now, a new virtual medical service called Teledaktar (TD) is trying to make health care more easily accessible. Every week, TD’s medical operators travel to the islands by boat, carrying a laptop, a portable printer for prescriptions and tools to run basic medical screenings such as blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature and weight. They choose an area of the island with the best Internet reception and set up a makeshift (临时凑合的) medical center which consists of plastic stools and small tables borrowed from the locals’ homes, a tent in case of rain and a sheet that is strung up to give the patients privacy during their session.
D) 	Launched in October 2018, TD has eight centers in towns and villages across rural Bangladesh and on three islands. It is funded by a nonprofit organization founded by Bangladeshi entrepreneurs, finance and technology professionals. Inside the center, the laptop screen lights up to reveal Dr. Tina Mustahid, TD’s head physician, live-streamed (网络直播) from the capital city of Dhaka for free remote medical consultations. Affectionately called Doctor Apa— “older sister” in Bengali—by her patients, she is one of three volunteer doctors at TD.
E) “I diagnose them through conversation,” says Dr. Mustahid. “Sometimes it’s really obvious things that local doctors don’t have the patience to talk through with their patients. For example, a common complaint mothers come in with is that their children refuse to eat their meals. The mothers are concerned they are dealing with indigestion, but it’s because they are feeding the children packaged chips which are cheap and convenient. I tell them it is ruining their appetite and ask them to cut back on unhealthy snacks.” Dr. Mustahid says building awareness about health and nutrition is important for island patients who are cut off from mainland resources.
F)	Even off the islands, Bangladesh faces a critical deficit of health services. The country has half the doctors-per-person ratio recommended by the World Health Organization: roughly one doctor per 2,000 people, instead of one doctor per 1,000 people. And of those physicians, many are concentrated in cities: 70% of the country’s population live in rural areas, yet less than 20% of health workers practice there. Over 70% of TD’s 3,000 patients are female, in part because many are not comfortable speaking with local doctors who tend to be male. The rural women are mostly not literate or confident enough to travel on their own to the nearest town to visit medical facilities. Many have spent their entire lives rebuilding their homes when the islands flood. Early marriage and young motherhood, which are prevalent in these parts of Bangladesh, also contribute to the early onset of health problems.
G)	For most TD patients on the islands, Dr. Mustahid is the first big-city doctor that they’ve ever consulted. TD doctors are not meant to treat serious illnesses or conditions that require a doctor to be physically present, such as pregnancy. But they can write prescriptions, diagnose common ailments—including digestive issues, joint pain, skin diseases, fever and the common cold—and refer patients to doctors at local hospitals. The visit is also an opportunity for the patients, especially women, to air their concerns about aging, motherhood and reproductive health according to Dr. Mustahid. The doctors also offer health, dietary and lifestyle advice where necessary, including insight on everything from recognizing postnatal (产后的) depression to daily exercise. Dr. Mustahid regularly recommends her patients to take a daily thirty-minute morning walk before the sun gets too intense.
H)	After a few sessions about general health issues Fazila finally opened up about something else that was bothering her: her persistent skin condition. It can get expensive to travel to the doctor, so usually the women living on the islands describe their illness to their husbands. The husbands then go to the pharmacy, try to describe the issue and return home with some random medicines. Nothing worked for Fazila until she started seeing Dr. Apa.
I)	Other nonprofits are also starting to provide health services on the islands. A local non-governmental organization called Friendship operates floating boat hospitals that provide health services to islands all over Bangladesh, docking at each for two months at a time. Friendship also runs satellite clinics in which one doctor and one clinic aide who are residents of the community disperse health and hygiene information.
J)	TD still has a few major challenges. Many residents complain the medicines they are prescribed are sometimes unaffordable, but the government isn’t doing enough for them. Patients often ask why the medicine isn’t free along with the consultation from the doctors. The organizations are linked to local pharmacies and offer discounts to the patients and make sure to prescribe the most cost-effective brands, but still many residents can’t afford even that.
K)	Nevertheless, TD’s remote consultations seem to be popular: Of 3,000 patients, at least 200 have returned for follow-ups, according to TD. The reason, explains one resident, might be the simple gesture of treating the island inhabitants with respect. “Dr. Apa is patient,” he says, “At government hospitals, the doctors treat us very badly, but here they listen to us, I can repeat myself many times and no one gets annoyed.”
36.	Some children on the remote islands won’t eat their meals because they are fed cheap junk food.
37.	Unlike other parts of Bangladesh, the number of women who die from giving birth remains high on the river islands.
38.	One big problem many islanders have is that they can’t afford the prescribed medicines, even with discounts offered.
39.	TD is a virtual medical service financially supported by one of the nation’s nonprofit organizations. 
40. TD doctors are welcome to the islanders because they treat the sick with respect and patience.
41.	Women islanders tend to have health problems early partly because they get married and give birth early.
42.	TD doctors make weekly visits to the remote islands to provide services at a temporary medical center. 
43. TD doctors provide the islanders with online diagnoses and treatments for common diseases.
44.	The residents of the river islands have to keep moving their homes because of floods and land erosions.
45.	Women islanders usually rely on their husbands to get some medicines for them without diagnoses and prescriptions.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Selective colleges and universities in the U.S. are under fire for being too elite and too expensive, and for not training graduates for the world of work. Such charges ignore the fact that these institutions continue to prepare students for success in their work, for thoughtful engagement in civic life, for lifelong learning, and for understanding the world and those with whom they live.
　　　These colleges and universities must be doing something right. Applications are at record highs, and their financial aid programs make them more accessible than ever. This model of education has long played a central role in creating opportunity, driving economic growth, and spurring innovation.
　　　Yet, there is growing skepticism about the value of this model. The recent tax reform bill is a wake-up call that our strongest colleges and universities are under assault by some in government. The initial proposals would have made education unaffordable for many by taxing tuition waivers for graduate students and ending deductions for student loan interest. Thankfully, these provisions were ultimately stripped from the bill, but lawmakers let stand a new tax on the investment income of some colleges and universities.
　　　While these attacks are motivated by misguided ideas, we need to do a better job of explaining why these claims are false and why what we do is valuable. We cannot take for granted that any of this is obvious.
　　　It is often said that elite colleges and universities do not train students, particularly those who study the liberal arts, for the workforce. But this can be refuted by scholarly research. The data are clear: a liberal arts education is great career preparation, both for excellent lifetime earnings and for satisfaction with the work. This education develops the skills of critical thinking, rigorous analysis of data and facts, communication with the written and spoken word, understanding of cultural differences and issues, and the ability to keep learning. In fact, liberal arts graduates do extremely well in every imaginable field.
　　　Access to an education at selective colleges and universities is now more available than ever to low-and middle-income families. We have built endowments from donations by alumni (校友) and parents who understand and appreciate our mission to provide access and opportunity, and a significant portion of the returns from these endowments is used to fund financial aid.
　　　Ironically, the new tax on endowments drains financial aid funds from the very schools most able to offer opportunity to those who have earned a spot but cannot otherwise afford this education. Beyond the virtue of access to those who have earned a place at these schools, the diversity of economic backgrounds enhances the education and experience of all of our students.
46. What fact does the author emphasize concerning selective colleges and universities?
　　A) They have been ignoring the training of graduates for the world of work.
　　B) They have been doing well in ensuring their students a successful future.
　　C) They have been constantly attacked for being too elite and too expensive.
　　D) They have been actively engaged in civic life beyond the school campus.
47. What does the author say in arguing for the model of education in the U.S.?
　　A) It has contributed substantially to the nation’s overall development.
　　B) It has succeeded in maintaining sustainable financial aid programs.
　　C) It has given priority to innovative programs for graduate studies.
　　D) It has played a central role in attracting international applicants.
48. What do we learn about the initial proposals concerning the recent tax reform bill?
　　A) They would have stripped many students of life’s chances.
　　B) They would have deducted graduate student loan interest.
　　C) They would have added to many students’ financial burden.
　　D) They would have increased the number of tuition waivers.
49. What do the data show about elite colleges and universities?
　　A) Their graduates lack the rigor required for doing statistical analysis.
　　B) Their students prove to be inadequately prepared for their future careers.
　　C) Their focus on research is conducive to developing students’ critical thinking.
　　D) Their liberal arts education enables graduates to excel in whatever field they are in.
50. What is an advantage of providing financial aid for students?
　　A) Every student can choose the institution they wish to attend.
　　B) All students can benefit from a diversified student population.
　　C) All students will be able to earn a place on university campus.
　　D) Less privileged students will be more competitive at elite schools.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　When a group of Australians was asked why they believed climate change was not happening, about 36% said it was “common sense”, according to a report published last year by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. This was the most popular reason for their opinion, with only 11% saying their belief that climate change was not happening was based on scientific research.
　　But what do we mean by an appeal to common sense? Presumably it’s an appeal to rationality of some sort that forms the basis of more complex reasoning. The appeal to common sense, however, is usually nothing more than an appeal to thinking that just feels right, but what feels right to one person may not feel right to another. Whether it feels right is usually a reflection of the world view and ideologies we have internalised, and that frames how we interact with new ideas. When new ideas are in accord with what we already believe, they are more readily accepted. When they are not, they, and the arguments that lead to them, are more readily rejected.
　　We often mistake this automatic compatibility testing of new ideas with existing beliefs as an application of common sense, but, in reality, it is more about judging than thinking. As Nobelist Daniel Kahneman notes in Thinking, Fast and Slow, when we arrive at conclusions in this way, the outcomes also feel true, regardless of whether they are. We are not psychologically well equipped to judge our own thinking.
　　We are also highly susceptible to a range of cognitive biases such as giving preference to the first things that come to mind when making decisions or giving weight to evidence.
　　One way we can check our internal biases and inconsistencies is through the social verification of knowledge, in which we test our ideas in a rigorous and systematic way to see if they make sense not just to us, but to other people. The outstanding example of this socially shared cognition is science.
　　That does not mean that individuals are not capable of excellent thinking, nor does it mean no individual is rational. But the extent to which individuals can do this on their own is a function of how well integrated they are with communities of systematic inquiry in the first place. You can’t learn to think well by yourself.
　　In matters of science at least, those who value their common sense over methodological, collaborative investigation imagine themselves to be more free in their thinking, unbound by involvement with the group, but in reality they are tightly bound by their capabilities and perspectives. We are smarter together than we are individually, and perhaps that’s just common sense.
51.	What does the author intend to show by citing the findings from the report published last year?
　　A) People seldom appeal to rationality in their thinking.
　　B) It is often the case that truth lies in the hands of a few.
　　C) Common sense and science are the two sides of a coin.
　　D) Few people know if climate change is really happening.
52.	What is the appeal to common sense according to the author?
　　A) It is the basis for the internalisation of individuals’ ideologies.
　　B) It is a series of conceptions formulated from complex reasoning.
　　C) It is collective wisdom that helps people interact with new ideas.
　　D) It is something subjective based on what one perceives to be right.
53.	What does Daniel Kahneman think is the problem of testing new ideas with existing beliefs?
　　A) It may lead to incorrect judgment.
　　B) It makes no use of common sense.
　　C) It fails to correct mistakes through serious reasoning.
　　D) It can produce psychologically unacceptable outcomes.
54.	What can we do to be less susceptible to cognitive biases?
　　A) Give equal weight to evidence of both sides in a conflict.
　　B) Provide convincing examples in developing an argument.
　　C) Establish socially shared cognition via scientific methods.
　　D) Avoid inconsistencies when addressing controversial issues.
55.	What message does the author try to convey at the end of the passage?
　　A) Multiple perspectives stimulate people’s interest in exploring the unknown.
　　B) Individuals can enhance their overall capabilities by interacting with others.
　　C) Individuals should think freely to break from the restrictions of common sense.
　　D) Collaborative efforts can overcome individuals limitations in scientific inquiry.

　　　Thinking kind thoughts about yourself and your loved ones can prove beneficial for your overall wellbeing, empirical evidence has shown. Researchers carried out an investigation to explore the  26  between having kind thoughts and a person’s psychological state.
　　　For the study, five groups of participants were presented with a different set of audio instructions, some of which encouraged the participants to think   27   about themselves and others which persuaded them to think in a self-critical manner. After listening to the audio instructions, the participants were asked to answer a series of questions. These included whether they felt agitated, how likely they were to show kindness to themselves and how   28	   they felt to other individuals.
　　　The participants who were instructed to think kindly about themselves were more likely to exhibit a bodily response associated with being relaxed and feeling safe. Their heart rates also dropped, which is a healthy sign of a heart that can respond flexibly to situations. Yet,   29  , those who listened to the critical audio clips were noted as having a higher heart rate and sweat response afterwards, both of which   30   feelings of threat and distress.

These findings help us to further understand some of our clinical trials research findings, where we show that individuals with  				32				  depression benefit particularly from self-awareness-based  					33					  therapy. They essentially learn to become more sympathetic to themselves.
　　　The sense is that for people   34   to depression, meeting their negative thoughts and feelings with   35   is a radically different way; that these thoughts are not facts. It introduces a different way of being and knowing that is quite transformative for many people.

Saving Our Planet
A) In the long view, the human relationship with forests has been one of brutal destruction, but even it carries elements of slow hope. In the Middle Ages, there was no shortage of timber in most parts of the world, and few saw cutting down forests as a problem. Yet in 1548 the people of Venice estimated that an important timber supply would last only 30 years at their current rate of usage—but different forest management would make it possible to meet the demand for many centuries to come. The idea of preserving resources came out of a concern for the future: a fear of using up resources faster than they could be replenished (补充).
B)	Economic interests were at the core of this understanding of trees and forests. It would take more than three centuries before scientists began to understand that timber production is not the only, and possibly not the most important, function of forests. The late 19th and early 20th century saw an increasing recognition that forests serve as habitats for countless animal and plant species that all rely on each other. They take over protective functions against soil erosion and landslides (塌方); they make a significant contribution to the water balance as they prevent surface runoff; they filter dirt particles, greenhouse gases and radioactive substances from the air; they produce oxygen; they provide spaces for recreation and they preserve historic and prehistoric remains. As a result, forests around the world have been set aside as parks or wilderness areas.
C)	Recent years have seen a big change in our view of forests. Peter Wohlleben’s book The Hidden Life of Trees (2015), an international bestseller, suggests that trees can warn each other of danger through a “wood wide web” of roots and fungi (真菌). They support each other through sharing of nutrients and information, and they even keep ancient stumps alive by feeding them solutions of sugars. Such insights have made us aware of deep ecological relationships between humans and the more-than-human world.
D)	Awareness of ecologies is a recent phenomenon. It was not until the 1940s that the concept of the “environment” embracing all living and nonliving things developed. In the 1970s, the term “environment” gained currency, becoming widely adopted in the English and Romance languages, and as “Umwelt”  (“surrounding world”) in German. The emergence of the idea led to the rise of environmental agencies, regulations and environmental studies, and to environmental science as new, integrated academic disciplines. It was in 1956 that the very first bachelor of science in environmental studies was awarded, at the State University of New York College of Forestry at Syracuse. Since the 1970s—with the rise of “environmentalism”—environmental studies programmes have sprung up at hundreds of universities. There is (slow) hope in the fact that scholars from many different disciplines have adopted the term “environment” over the past decades. They are exploring intricate connections within and between complex ecologies, as well as the impact that human environment-making (through techno-industrial, economic and other manipulative developments) has had on the biosphere.
E)	The rise of the idea of the environment and a scholarly understanding of ecological processes has influenced new technologies and also politics. We have come to ask questions about vulnerability and risk, world ecologies, and the relationship between nature and power. The search for an adequate response to climate change occupies centre stage in international diplomacy.
F) Social and environmental activists, scientists and indigenous groups have called the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2015 insufficient, weak, or compromised. To some extent, they are right: climate change has already destroyed tens of thousands of livelihoods, and the situation will worsen in the near future for millions of mostly poorer people, who will join the ranks of those who have already been displaced by climate change and extreme weather events. But the Paris Conference nevertheless marked a historic step toward the recognition of the need for action on climate change, the cutting of carbon emissions, and world cooperation. There were 195 nations that came to the table in Paris and agreed to limits on emissions. Historically, nothing comparable had happened prior to this. Before the 20th century, a handful of scientists had been interested in the theoretical relationship between greenhouse gases and climate change, but only the empirical evidence accumulated since the late 20th century established a clear connection between the burning of fossil fuels and a vastly accelerated rise in global temperatures.
G) The current crisis is not the first that humans have encountered, and a look at the struggles with pollution in recent history reveals transformations that once seemed unimaginable. The “London fog” that came to define the capital through British novels and thrillers is in reality smog or smoke, a legacy of industrialisation. After a century of ignorance, London was hit by the Great Smog of December 1952—the worst air-pollution event in the history of the United Kingdom which caused the deaths of approximately 12,000 people. Shortly thereafter, public initiatives and political campaigns led to strict regulations and new laws, including the Clean Air Act (1956). Today, London has effectively reduced traffic emissions through the introduction of a Congestion Charge Zone in 2003, and an Ultra Low Emission Zone in 2019.
H)	Scientific evidence that we are living in an era of climate change, resource exhaustion and potential ecological disaster is overwhelming. How do we motivate a public exhausted by never-ending scenarios of doom and disaster, when the challenges seem so huge and so impossible to solve? Statistics about extinction and the gloom of decline will not in themselves get us out of our often self-created ecological traps: instead, they are more likely to result in paralysis and inaction.
I)	We need stories and histories of change and transformation: ecological stories that make us confront the fact that human power is potentially destructive, and that the survival of our species on this planet depends on the preservation of soil and water, and the habitats and ecological systems.
J)	It is time that we showed successes and accelerations in ecological awareness, action and restoration: stories that include past successes and future visions about the rise of urban gardening and of renaturalised riverscapes, of successful protests against polluted air and water, of the rise of regional markets and slow food, and the planting of trees around the globe, of initiatives and enterprises that work towards ecological restoration. The reality of ecological curses seems far greater than the power of the hopes left at the bottom of Pandora’s box. But if we believe that nothing can be changed, then we are giving up our opportunity to act.
K)	Today’s saving powers will not come from a deus ex machina (解围之神). In an ever-more complex and synthetic world, our saving powers won’t come from a single source, and certainly not from a too-big-to-fail approach or from those who have been drawn into the whirlpool of our age of speed. Hope can work as a wakeup call. It acknowledges setbacks. The concept of slow hope suggests that we can’t expect things to change overnight. If the ever-faster exhaustion of natural resources (in ecological terms) and the “shrinking of the present” (in social terms) are urgent problems of humans, then cutting down on exhaustive practices and working towards a “stretching of the present” will be ways to move forward.
36.	Climate change has wrought havoc on the lives of tens of thousands of people.
37.	It took scientists a long time to realise that the function of forests goes far beyond providing humans with timber.
38.	There is abundant evidence that we are now facing a possible ecological disaster.
39.	Environmental science became academic disciplines only some sixty years ago.
40.	Things cannot change overnight, but reducing the consumption of natural resources will help solve the ecological crisis.
41.	Human perception of forests has undergone a tremendous change in the past years.
42.	Recent history shows reduction of pollution, once seemingly impossible, can actually be accomplished.
43.	People began to consider preserving natural resources when they feared they would have nothing to use in the future.
44.	If we doubt our ability to reverse ecological deterioration, we are throwing away the chance to take action.
45.	How to respond effectively to climate change has become the focus of international diplomacy.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Since American idol star Taryn Southern started composing music with AI in 2017, musicians all over the world have begun wondering about the implications of AI and modern technology where music production is concerned. Using AI in the creation of music is perceived by some as a helpful tool and by others as almost “the beginning of the end”.
　　　In Taryn’s case, AI software enabled her to communicate melodies and chords that she didn’t know how to put together herself. The end product was therefore a collaborative effort, rather than a piece entirely produced by technology. Taryn’s story has a distinctly positive feel that highlights the advantages of using AI in music production. It can serve as a source of inspiration, and as an ideal jumping-off point should a musician be hit with writer’s block (文思枯竭).
　　　Contrary to seeing AI as a tool, some musicians consider it to be hugely detrimental to the music scene. At the moment, because such technology is still so young, the music it’s producing is not necessarily what we want to hear. In short, it’s not of great quality. Those who have produced their own music, or even fans of authentic, artistic music, will also argue that a computer could never emulate the work (and human touch) of a true musician.
　　　Music has been an integral part of the story of humans for ages; in fact, the first known piece of music is believed to be around 3,400 years old. Songs have long been used as a means of communicating messages and folk stories, covering everything from societal ethics to world history. Since many people see music as such an inherently human expression, it is often considered as too precious to impart to technology. The thought of a computer generating a “random” piece of music that hasn’t been painstakingly created by an artist is almost seen as sacrilegious (亵渎神圣的).
　　　Regardless of which side of the argument you fall on, it seems likely that the use of AI in music production will only become more frequent. Our modern world is preoccupied with technological advancements. Instead of shying away from the idea of this bleak future, the best approach to take is one of optimism and curiosity. While there are always bound to be stubborn old-school musicians who refuse to use tech, music producers should consider AI as something to be embraced. AI music software is still very much in its infancy, but with more investors interested in the development and outcomes of such technology, and considering the rapid growth rate of other tech advances in recent years, it’s only a matter of time before AI-produced music is seen as the new norm.
46. How do some musicians perceive using AI in creating music?
　　A) It would help to produce more music idols.
　　B) It would be detrimental to music production.
　　C) It would hinder the understanding of authentic music.
　　D) It would be the beginning of a new era in music creation.
47.	What does Taryn Southern’s story illustrate?
　　A) AI technology is conducive to music composition.
　　B) Musicians will be unable to create music without high tech.
　　C) Musicians are often at their wits, end in their creative effort.
　　D) AI technology is indispensable to creating melodies and chords.
48.	Why are some musicians opposed to the use of AI in creating music?
　　A) Music produced with AI technology lacks humanness.
　　B) Music created with AI technology is easily emulated.
　　C) It will depreciate humans’ role in music composition.
　　D) It will deplete young musicians, creative inspiration.
49.	Why do many people think music is too precious to impart to AI technology?
　　A) It cannot be created without pains.
　　B) It cannot be produced at random.	
　　	C) It is part of human life.
　　D) It is human specific.
50.	What does the author think of the future of AI music?
　　A) It will continue to arouse the interest of music investors.
　　B) It has the prospect of becoming the norm in the future.
　　C) It will be gradually accepted by old-school musicians.
　　D) It may eventually lose its freshness and appeal.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　A few weeks ago, a well-meaning professor tried to explain the physiological process behind viruses and the human body in a tweet and was immediately criticized for a mistake in his information. He then issued an apology and deleted his erroneous tweet.
　　　Communicating science beyond the academic bubble is necessary to augmenting public understanding of health and environmental issues and helping individuals make well-informed personal decisions.
　　　However, scientists who engage in science communication must acknowledge that even in their area, their expertise is deep but narrow. They need to recognize the constraints in their own knowledge. That is not to suggest that they only write or present on their own research, but rather, that they consult with an expert if the topic is outside of their discipline. Fact-checking with a scientist who works in the specialty will prevent the unintentional spread of misinformation, and the process of doing so may yield tiny pieces of interesting new information that can be incorporated.
　　　Some have argued that the public is not educated enough to understand scientific information, especially for any complex phenomena, but this is absurd. Science instruction can be found at all levels of public education with most secondary schools offering classes on biology, physics, and chemistry. If anything, social media has shown that the public craves knowledge based on a solid scientific foundation. Even the public discourse that follows most scientific articles shows that online readers can understand even the most baffling of scientific principles.
　　　It is equally imperative to emphasize that being an expert on a topic does not automatically make a scholar qualified to communicate it to a nonscientific audience. A number of scientists recently have been offering public-aimed explanations of scientific phenomena. Even though they have appropriate credentials, they often do very little in the way of explaining. One biologist shared an intricate analogy involving a library, books, paper, a recipe, ingredients, and a cake to explain the process behind vaccines. Any explanation that requires a written key to keep track of what each item represents is not a clear example for public consumption.
　　　Science communication is a science in and of itself. It requires rigorous training and instruction. A scientist should take communication courses that can teach a person how to identify and eliminate jargon and how to develop effective analogies to explain complex concepts. One cannot assume communication expertise-imagine if someone just decided that they were a physicist and started trying to contribute to the field without the necessary background. Doing a poor job communicating science to the public will only create confusion and widen the gap between science and society, a gap that scientists are trying to close. 
51. What does the author say about communicating science to the general public?
　　A) It will help them to keep abreast of the latest scientific developments.
　　B) It is a necessary means to improve their understanding of scientific issues.
　　C) It will get them more involved in academic debates on environmental problems.
　　D) It is an effective way to augment scientists’ influence beyond the academic circle.
52.	What does the author advise scientists do to deal with topics outside of their specialty?
　　A) Write or present on them from new angles.	
　　B) Utilize information from diverse sources.
　　C) Turn to a specialist for professional help.
　　	D) Fact-check with colleagues in their field.
53.	What does the author say we can learn from social media?
　　A) A solid academic foundation is essential to understanding baffling scientific principles.
　　B) Modern technology has facilitated communication between scientists and the public.
　　C) Scientific articles have gained increasing popularity among the general public.
　　D) The public’s understanding of science is much better than some have claimed.
54.	What does the example of the biologist who shared an intricate analogy show?
　　A) It is helpful to use illustrations in explaining scientific phenomena.
　　B) It is imperative to have appropriate titles to explain scientific issues.
　　C) A learned scholar is not necessarily a qualified science communicator.
　　D) A nonscientific audience cannot duly understand principles of science.
55.	What does the author suggest scientists do to close the gap between science and society?
　　A) Explain complex concepts scientifically.
　　B) Make appropriate use of scientific terms. 
　　C) Take courses in public speaking.
　　D) Develop communication skills.

　　　The  now  extinct  passenger  pigeon  has  the  dubious  honor  of  being  the  last  species anyone  ever  expected  to  disappear.  At  one  point,  there  were  more  passenger  pigeons  than any   other   species   of  bird.Rough    26   of  their  population  went  as  high  as  five  billion and  they  accounted  for  around  40  percent  of the  total  indigenous  bird  population  of North
America in the  early  19th  century.
　　　Despite   their   huge   population,   passenger   pigeons   were   27   to   human    intrusion  into  their  nesting  territory.  Their  nests  were  shabby  things  and  two  weeks  after  the  eggs  	28   ,the  parent  pigeons  would  abandon  their  offspring,leaving  them  to  take  care  of themselves.  People  discovered  that  these  baby  pigeons  were  really  tasty,  and  the  adult  birds were   also   quite   29   .  First  the  Native  Americans  and  then  the  transplanted  Europeans
came  to  consider the birds  a  great   30  .
　　　By  the  1850s,  commercial  trapping  of passenger  pigeons  was  proceeding  at  an  3.1	 pace.  Hundreds  of thousands  of the  birds  were  being  harvested  every  day  to  be  made  into  popular  pigeon  pies.  In  addition,  large   32  of  the  pigeons'  nesting  territory  were  being cleared  away  for  planting  crops  and  creating  pasture  land.As  numerous  as  the  passenger pigeons  were,they  were  not  an   33   resource.By  the  1880s,  it  was  noticed  that  the  bird population   had   become  seriously      34   .  The  last  passenger  pigeons  killed  in  the  wild
were  shot  in  1899.
　　　Eventually  those  billions  and  billions  of birds  shrank  to  a  single  remaining   35   ,a passenger   pigeon   named    Martha,who    died    on    September    1,1914,in    captivity    at   the Cincinnati  Zoo.In  addition  to  being  the  end  of  an  era,  it  was  also  the  first  time  humans

Section     B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it.   Each statement  contains  information given in  one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from  which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each   paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on
Answer Sheet 2.
Is computer coding a foreign language?
A)As computer coding has become an increasingly sought-after skill, more K- 12 schools are working it into their curriculums. Some states have considered allowing students to forgo(放弃)foreign language for coding classes, despite opposition from educators.
B)There's a debate over whether it's appropriate to teach coding in elementary schools, with fierce opinions on each side. When it comes to allowing coding to fill  foreign language   requirements,though,most   educators   agree:Coding   should   be   added   to curriculums, but not at the expense of foreign language classes.
C) The idea is that computer programming is a language,allowing people to communicate  with machines and programs. It's the language of the 21st century and more valuable  than a natural language, some advocates argue. The computer science field is growing  faster than  schools  can keep  up because  of budget  constraints  and  a  lack  of skills training for teachers.
D)According   to  the 2016 U.S. News/Raytheon STEM Index, computer science jobs have  helped boost wages in the U.S.,and computer-related jobs hold the top seven positions  in  STEM fields for highest number of workers. Foreign language interest, on the other  hand,  is  declining  for  the  first  time  since  1995.  The  number  of higher  education  language  enrollments declined between 2009  and 2013 by more than  111,000 spots, according to the Modern Language Association of America.
E)“I think the opportunity to give people a choice is important,”says Florida state Senator Jeremy  Ring,who  introduced  a  bill  last  year  that  would  allow  Florida  students  to choose between  foreign  language  and  coding  classes  for  the purpose  of university admissions requirements,“I think if you're going to give two years of language in high school, you might as well do computer coding.”
F)The  Florida bill  died  this  year  after passing  35:5  in  the  state  Senate  when  the  full  Legislature failed to take action. It would have been the first state to try this initiative. Ring says that although he will be out of office,an identical bill will be reintroduced  within the next year by others on his behalf.“In the speech I gave on the Senate floor,I  said,‘We can be the first state to  do this, or we can be the 50th state to do it.It's our choice.It's  going to happen,”Ring  says.
G)A Kentucky bill similar to the one in Florida was met with complaints from educators, and  was  then  amended  to  promote  computer  science  education  initiatives  with  no mention of foreign language requirements. Instead, the state will provide support for higher quality certified teachers for programming classes. Under the Washington bill,
2022年9月英语六级真题第1套第5页共11 页 by:光速考研

public  universities would accept two years of computer science classes in place of two years  of foreign  language  for  admission  purposes.  A  report  detailing  the  opinions  of state university officials is due to the Legislature by November 2017.
H)Texas passed a bill in 2013 that allows students to substitute computer coding only after they have attempted and performed poorly in a foreign language class. Srini Mandyam,  CTO  and  co-founder  of  kid-friendly  instructional  coding  company  Tynker,believes  allowing students to forgo foreign language because they struggle with it is unproductive  because every subject, whether art, math or language, is a significant contribution to a  well-rounded   existence.“Many  students  don't  fare  well  with  algebra  but  we  never discuss eliminating it or … say chemistry is now counted as an algebra class,”he said via  email.“We  teach  algebra because  it's  important  and  we  should  teach  foreign  language  and  coding  for the  same reason.  Exposure to  a wide breadth  of subjects  and material
results in well-rounded students who are able to make informed decisions … about what they want to pursue.”
I)    Computer  science  courses  already  fulfill  a  math  or  science  high  school  graduation requirement in 28 states and the District of Columbia, up from only  12 states in 2013. And  while  advocates  of the  bills  say  they  should  count  as  foreign  language  instead, opponents stress the importance of balancing computer and foreign language skills.
J) Studies show that bilingualism(双语)correlates with cognitive development, intelligence, memory   and  problem   solving   abilities,according  to  the  American   Council   on  the Teaching  of Foreign  Languages.  A  2007  study  showed  that  foreign  language  students outperformed  their  non-foreign  language  peers  on  standardized  tests after  only  two  to three years of study. And while a 2014 report from German and American universities suggests  that  programmers  are  using  language(  but  not  mathematical)  regions  of the brain   when   understanding   code,critics   remain   wary.   They   say   that   regardless   of cognitive functions, being monolingual is a disadvantage in the increasingly international  economy,even if English has become the de facto(事实上的)language of business.
K)“Our   world   is  shrinking  but  its  problems  are  really  growing,”says  ACTFL  National Language Teacher of the Year Ted Zarrow, who teaches high school Latin in Westwood,  Massachusetts,  and  has  also  studied  Spanish,  French,  German,  Italian  and  Greek.“We need  to  find  a  way  to  put  ourselves  at  the  global  table  and  to  treat  each  other  with  mutual  respect.  And  learning  languages  allows  us  to  do  that  because  language  is  not part of culture, language is culture.”
L)Even with the benefits  and  skill  sets  languages provide, recruiters  and  employers value

computer   skills   more.   According   to  the   National   Association   of   Colleges   and
Employers'  2016  report,study  abroad  and  foreign  language  fluency  were  not  very influential  in  the  employee  hiring  processes,  but  55  percent  of employers  looked  for computer  skills  on  applicants'  resumes.  However,  although  2016  computer  science graduates  can  expect  to  make  the  second  highest  starting  salary  compared  with  other jobs this year, the Bureau of Labor predicts the demand for computer programmers will
2022年9月英语六级真题第1套第6页共11 页 by: 光速考研

decrease 8 percent or by 26,500 jobs by 2024.
M) Ring says foreign language skills are important, but expresses doubt that school districts could work both coding and language into their curriculum in a significant way because they  lack  the  time  in  the  school  day.“Nothing  against  language,”he  says.“I just  think it's  something  you  have  to  start  early  and  not just  have  something  that  you  do  for  a couple of years in high school,”he says.
N)Zarrow  agrees  that  foreign  language  education  should  begin  earlier,  but  says  it  is possible  to  work  both  computer  programming  and  foreign  language  learning  into schools evenly. He suggests an immersive, dual language program where students spend half the day in English and half the day in another language,as several schools around the country have successfully implemented.“The study of language fosters a respect for
diversity, a respect for ethnicity and really a respect for language,”Zarrow says.
O)Though  the  benefits  of  computer  programming  skills  are  vast,  foreign  language  and coding experts agree that computer science should be negotiated into curriculums rather than replacing foreign language outright. Mandyam says the two skill sets are essential but unrelated.“Coding is an incredibly important 21st century skill for our kids to learn,  and  that's  why  we  spend  so  much  time  trying  to  teach  it,”Mandyam  says  via  email. “But I believe it is the same as or even really comparable to learning a foreign language. It would be  a shame to lose something so important for the sake of adding something else,even  something as important as coding. Clearly, education leaders must figure out
a way to teach both.”
36.Employers  attach  more  importance  to  applicants'  computer  skills  than  their  language
competence.
37.One       U.S.state  senator proposed that high  school  students be  allowed to  study  either
foreign language or computer coding.
38.Learning  languages  broadens  students'  international  perspective  and  nurtures  mutual
respect among peoples, according to a high school language teacher.
39.One U.S.state will see to it that programming classes are taught by quality teachers.
40.Statistics   show   while  computer-related jobs  have  been  on  the  rise,  foreign  languages
have become less appealing to American students since mid- 1990s.
41.All school subjects are said to be essential to students' well-rounded development.
42. There is consensus among most educators that coding  should be taught in  schools but
should not replace foreign language.
43.   One   study   showed   that   foreign   language   learning   improved   students’academic
performance.
44.Being  short  of funding  and  qualified  teachers,  schools  lag  behind  the  fast  developing
computer science field.
45.A  distinguished  high  school  language  teacher  also  believes  it  is  advisable  to  start
learning a foreign language at an earlier age.

Section     C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them  there  are  four  choices  markedA),B),C)  and  D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　The  U.S.  and  China  don't  agree  on  much  these  days.  Germany  and  France  share  a border and a currency but are frequently at odds. The U. K.and India like to march to their  own  drum. But there's  one  issue  on which  all these  countries  see eye to eye: Technology companies  are  too  big, too powerful, and too profitable. And that power is only likely to intensify,  leaving  governments  with  no  choice  but  to  confront  it  head-on  by  taking   the companies to court, passing new competition laws, and perhaps even breaking up the tech
giants.
　　　China  is  the  latest  to  implement  an  anti-trust  crackdown,   unveiling   anti-monopoly rules  last month.  The  draft rules  followed the  surprise  suspension  of a  $  37 billion  stock offering by billionaire Jack Ma's Ant Group Co., making clear that no company can evade the  government's regulation.  The moves  in  China  coincide with  accelerating  efforts  in the
U.S.and  Europe  to  rein  in  Amazon.com,  Apple, Facebook,  and  Google.
　　　“The  big  get  bigger  and  bigger  but  without  being  better,”says  Andreas  Schwab,  a German member  of the European Parliament who  championed  a 2014 resolution to break up  Google.“Growing  economic  power,growing  influence  on  local  markets  all  over  the world,  and  a  growing  concern  of  competitors  and  consumers  altogether  have  made  it
happen now.”
　　　In this new  anti-trust  era, the  old  focus  on pricing power no longer applies, because several   of  the  biggest  tech   companies  have   established  trillion-dollar  monopolies  by charging  consumers  next  to  nothing.  Tech  giants  are  increasingly  assuming  powerful positions   in   banking,finance,advertising,retail,   and   other   markets   that   force   smaller
businesses to rely on their platforms to reach customers.
　　　For  years,Europe  alone  confronted  the  power  of  digital  giants.  Governments  were alarmed that European companies were  failing to match  Silicon Valley's innovations or to stop  Google  and  Facebook  from  vacuuming  up  personal  data  and,  with  that,  advertising revenue.  Led  by  Margrethe  Vestager,  the  European  Union's  competition  chief,  countries
have sought to police the market and encourage fair play.
　　　In  China the  crackdown has been  driven  at  least partly by  fear that the homegrown tech  industry  is  becoming  too  powerful.  The  country  has  long  championed  Alibaba  and Tencent,but  their  massive  accumulation  of  data  on  the  Chinese  citizenry  is  a  growing
concern for Beijing.
In the U.S.,a new breed of anti-trust experts argues that consideration should be given
2022年9月英语六级真题第1套第8页共11 页 by:光速考研

to privacy, control over data, workers'rights, and the overall impact on smaller companies. And the public in general have grown increasingly skeptical of social media companies. More than 60% say the sector has a negative effect on the country, and almost half want
more regulation for social media,according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study.

46. What does the author say is the issue all major economic powers have to address?
A)How to ensure the sustainable growth of their tech giants.
B)How to keep the competitiveness of their tech companies.
C) How to break up the powerful giant tech companies.   D)How to stop tech companies from gaining monopoly.

47. What does the suspension of Ant Group Co.'s stock offering suggest? A)All attempts to evade regulation are doomed to failure.
B) All attempts to monopolize sales must be cracked down.
C) All companies must be regulated by the government.   D)All companies, domestic or foreign,are created equal.

48. How are smaller companies impacted by tech giants' business expansion? A)They can no longer do business independent of tech giants.

and sea. Travel is often portrayed as a tool for personal growth and tourism as an economic motor  for  destination  countries  and  cities.  There  is  a  tendency  to  assume  that  tourism  is
good for everyone involved.
　　　Today  the  big  bang  of tourism  drives  over  1.2  billion  tourists  across  international  borders annually. Many popular places are literally being loved to death. Recent protests in  ports  of call  like Venice and  Barcelona  against  disturbances  created  by  cruise  ships  show
the unfortunate consequences of emphasizing quantity over quality in tourism.
　　　Uncontrolled   tourism   development   has   become   a   primary   driver   of  social   and environmental   disruption.   Tourism   studies  provide   much   documentation   of  the   many negative  social  impacts  of tourism  and  resulting  resentment  that  local  populations  direct
toward  visitors.
　　　Antagonism toward tourists typically  develops  in mature, heavily visited  destinations. Protests  in  heavily  visited  destinations  suggest  that  traditional  tourism  has  overstayed  its
welcome.
　　　Residents  often  become  frustrated  when  the  benefits  of tourism  are  not  felt  locally. Although  it  can  generate  foreign  exchange,  income  and  employment,  there's no  guarantee  that   multinational   hotel   chains   will   allocate   these   benefits   equitably   among   local
communities.
　　　On the contrary, when people stay at large resorts or on cruise ships, they make most of their purchases there, leaving local communities little opportunity to benefit from tourist spending.  These  forms  of tourism  widen  economic  and  political  gaps  between  haves  and
have-nots at local destinations.
　　　In   recent   decades,local   residents   in   destination   communities   also   have   found themselves negotiating new cultural boundaries, class dynamics,  service industry roles  and  lifestyle   transformations.   For   example,data   show   that   tourism   activity   corresponds   to
increased social problems as local residents adopt the behaviors of tourists.
What does all this mean for the everyday traveler?
　　　First,  all  tourists  should  make  every  effort  to  honor  their  hosts  and  respect  local  conditions.  This  means  being  prepared  to  adapt  to  local  customs  and  norms,rather  than
expecting local conditions to adapt to travelers.
　　　Second,tourism  is  a  market-based  activity  and  works  best  when  consumers  reward  better   performers.   In   the   information   age,there's   little   excuse   for   travelers   being uninformed about where their vacation money goes and who it enriches.
　　　Informed travelers also are better able to distinguish between multinational companies and    local    entrepreneurs    whose    businesses    provide    direct    social,environmental,and economic benefits for local residents.  Such businesses are in love with the destination and are  therefore  deserving  of market  reward.  In  the  long  run,  being  a  responsible  traveler means   ensuring   net   positive   impacts   for   local   people   and   environments.   With   the information   available at our fingertips, there has never been more opportunity to do so.

　　　During the  summer, when I was  a visiting poet  at  a residency  out  of state,an  angry, confused  woman  wandered  into  my  class  and  said:“I  have  three  guns  and  I  want  to  use them.”We    all   26  . It wasn't clear if she had the guns, but we each know that, when we teach in America, we are already in danger.
　　　I was dizzy with fear. The woman, who later turned out to be a schizophrenic(精神分 裂 症 患 者 )without    27    to  her  medications,  was,  by  some  force,  wrestled  out  and     28   away, then put in a hospital for observation, in a step that was  actually  safer  for  everyone than any one of us pressing charges. My class went on; we talked about poems. But  despite the  fact that the rest  of our days  on  campus passed    29   ,I   was   rattled.I  couldn't shake the sense that in this country we always live at     30risk.
　　　A  few months  later,  crisis   31   again. While my husband was locking his bike to drop  off  our  3-year-old  daughter  for  her  preschool-aged  day  camp,  a  different  woman  approached.Swiftly  and  for  no    32  reason,  she  bent  down,  picked  up  our  daughter,  and   began   to   carry   her   down   the   street.   It   was   so   fast   and   confusing   that   my  daughter     33   cried.My husband, in a burst of speed, chased the woman and  reclaimed our daughter. The woman, clearly  confused,  retreated  into  the  public  library.A   34   of  homeless  people  who  generally  know  the  other  homeless  in  the  area  said  they  did  not  recognize  the  woman.  The  woman  was  so  clearly  unwell  that  when  she  was  taken  into  custody  she  was  incoherent.  Heartbreakingly,  she  called  our  daughter  by  the  name  of someone else's child.Each part of the episode was as  haunting as it was   35

This man is running 7 marathons on 7 continents in 7 days
A) Michael Wardian pushed forward into the penetrating arctic(北极的)wind,fighting the  urge to  speed up. Too much effort and he'd begin to  sweat, which, he was told, would only increase the risk of hypothermia(体温过低).
B) At the 2014 North Pole Marathon, the temperature dipped to minus-22 degrees F, with a
wind  chill  that  made  it  feel  even  colder.Along  the  route,armed  guards  wandered  the
2022年12月英语六级真题第1套第4页共10页 by: 光速考研

large sheets of floating ice to minimize the risk of polar bear attacks.
C)“I    like    to    do    stuff   that    scares    me,”Wardian    said.With    ice    frozen    to    his    beard,    Wardian crossed the finish line that April afternoon in a winning time of 4 hours 7 minutes and 40 seconds,almost two hours slower than his personal best over 26.2 miles. The race for Wardian, however, was less about the result than overcoming his aversion to the
cold.
D)In  a  few  days,Wardian  will  once  again  compete  in  an  unfamiliar  territory  and below-freezing temperatures. He will line up Monday in Antarctica(南极)for the first leg  of the  World  Marathon  Challenge—joining  32  other  adventure  seekers  on  an unusual journey where participants travel through different time zones and climates to run seven marathons on seven continents in seven days.
E)An  elite  ultra-runner,Wardian  has  his  sights  on  breaking  the  event's  record  average  marathon time of 3:32:25 set last January by U.S. Marine Corps captain Daniel Cartica.  Wardian, a 42-year-old Arlington resident, is a record-breaking racer, known in the  ultra-running community for seeking tough courses and setting world records. Last year, he  ran  1,254.65  miles  in  47  races.  The  World  Marathon  Challenge,like  most  of  Wardian's running goals,will be about pushing his limits.“I love diverse and unique  challenges,”he said.“I'm definitely interested in seeing what I can handle and what my  body can accept. That drives me.”
F)Something  about  the  way  Richard  Donovan  carried  himself  appealed  to  Wardian. Perhaps it was the sense of adventure Donovan displayed when they first met at the 201050K  Championships  in  Galway,Ireland,where  Donovan  was  the  race  director. The two hit it off, and soon Wardian was participating in Donovan's events. It was at the North Pole Marathon, a race that Donovan organizes, that Wardian first heard about the  Irishman's  plan  for  the  World  Marathon  Challenge-a  challenge  that  Donovan himself completed in 2009 and 2012.“I knew that many people had a goal of running seven marathons on seven continents during any time period,”Donovan, 50, said.“I felt the natural extension to this idea would be to try to achieve it within a  seven-day period.”
G) Wardian  started  saving  for  the  trip  in  2014,connecting  with  sponsors  and  getting approval from his wife, Jennifer, before committing. Registration for the event costs 36,000 euros,which covers international charter flights to each of the seven marathon locations:    Union    Glacier (Antarctica), Punta Arenas, Chile (South    America), Miami (North America), Madrid (Europe), Marrakesh,Morocco (Africa), Dubai(Asia) and Sydney(Australia). The challenge is a test of both physical strength and mental fitness.

Sleeping on a crammed plane, adjusting to different time zones and finding food to eat (Wardian is a vegetarian) would make it an exhausting trip over a month, let alone a week.“The key to  a race like this is getting comfortable being uncomfortable,”said Becca Pizzi,last year's women's champion.“The highs of the race are incredibly high, and the lows incredibly low.”
H)Since turning it into an organized event in 2015, Donovan has attracted a variety of 2022年12月英语六级真题第1套第5页共10页 by: 光速考研

runners. This year's challenge will feature a far more elite field, which includes Ryan Hall, America's fastest marathon runner. Despite his proven track record, Hall said he has no time goals and that he still suffers from the same fatigue issues that forced him to leave the professional ranks in 2015.Hall plans to run with his friend, Pastor Matthew Barnett of The Dream Center in Los Angeles—one of the six American men who will be competing.“I don't expect to run a step with Mike, but I will be excited to see how he does,”said the 34-year-old Hall, who began weight-lifting after retiring.“If I finish within an hour of him in each marathon, I'd be surprised.”
I) Instead,43-year-old Petr Vabrousek, an elite Czech Ironman champion, is expected to  be Wardian's closest challenger. To others on the trip, simply finishing will be its own  reward.Sinead Kane of Ireland is aiming to become the first blind person to complete  the challenge. And Beth Ann Telford,a 47-year-old  federal government worker from  Fairfax and the only American female in this year's mix, is using the event as a platform  to raise money for cancer research. It's a cause with a personal connection to Telford,  who was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2004.“Doing something like this is definitely  the  hardest  challenge  that  I've  ever  done  except  for  the  chemotherapy  and  brain  surgery,”she  said.“It's going to raise awareness . …I just wanted to do something that is epic and this certainly is right up there.”Wardian, too, hopes his involvement will give  him a platform to promote a cause. He recently became an ambassador for the United  Nations Women's HeForShe initiative to fight inequalities faced by women and girls
worldwide.
J)On   a   chilly   December   afternoon,Wardian   wove   through   Washington's   crowded sidewalks on the way home from his full-time job as an international ship broker. His  elastic, 6-foot frame bounced gently and efficiently off the ground with each step of the  hilly six-mile trip back to Arlington. This is a daily routine during the week for Wardian, who started racing professionally in 2003 and runs seven days a week,often multiple  times a day. When he travels, he prefers to explore new places on his feet.
K)But in some ways, Wardian still has trouble thinking of himself as a runner. For the majority  of his  childhood,  Wardian  devoted  his  energy  to  becoming  a  Division  I lacrosse ( 长 曲 棍 球 )player-a dream he realized  when he was recruited to play at Michigan State University.“Once he decides to do something, he just works at it until  he  does  it,”Michael's  younger  sister,  Mariele,  said.“Once  he  decides  to  do  it,  it's usually  something  that's  going  to  happen.  He's  always been  like  that.  He's  a  very
motivated individual.”
L)It  was only a year or so ago that Wardian realized that he had been a runner longer than a lacrosse player. It was not until he ran in the 2004 U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials-the  first of three for Wardian-that he felt that he was a legitimate runner. Now more than 10 years and numerous ultra-marathon national titles and world records later, he embraces that identity. Wardian wants to see how far his legs can take him, one epic challenge at a

time.“I want to always keep doing things that are exciting, adventurous, different and most importantly, probably things I'm not the best at,”Wardian said,“because if you're
2022年12月英语六级真题第1套第6页共10页 by: 光速考研

not  seeking  things  out  that  are  challenging  and  difficult  for  you,  then  you're  not growing  …  So  I  hope  maybe  people  see  what  I  do,  and  say,‘Okay,  I  want  to  do something different or try something new. … I'm going to do something that scares me.  That's what I'm hoping people will take from it.”
36.Wardian   regards   the   various   extraordinary   challenges   as   a   test   of  his   physical
endurance
37.Wardian  hopes  his  participation  in  the  seven-day  marathon  series  will  contribute  to  a worthy  cause.

Section      C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each  of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2  with a single line through the centre.
Passage  One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Many  people  associate  their  self-worth  with  their  work.  The  more  successful  their career, the better they feel about themselves. Work-related self-esteem is therefore a worthy ideal to pursue with vigor, right? Well, not always. According to recent research, in which  psychologists  interviewed  370 full-time workers over a period of three weeks, the reality is a little more complicated.And it involves negative as well as positive consequences.
　　　It's natural to be drawn towards pleasure and to step away from pain. In the workplace,  if that  pleasure  comes  from  a  triumph  which  swells  our  self-respect,  people  will  try  to repeat  the  accomplishment.  But repeating  that  accomplishment  is  often  not realistic,which  can lead to  severe negative emotional consequences when it doesn't reoccur. This form of motivation  is widely regarded  as  a negative type  of motivation.  It  can hinder  other more  positive  motivation  types,  such  as  completing  a  task  purely  because  it's  fulfilling  or  enjoyable.
　　　What  consumes  the  employee  instead  is  a pressing  need  to  feel  mighty  and  sure  of themselves. They then take on only tasks and objectives which serve that ego-driven need.

As  a  result,  to  avoid  feelings  of  shame  and  worthlessness  associated  with  failure,they extend  themselves  to  such  a  degree  that  there's  a  subsequent  adverse  effect  on  their well-being. This internal pressure to succeed at all costs demands a lot of effort. It depletes their energy, culminating in disproportionate levels of damaging sentiment.
　　　Those  negative  emotions  mount  into  heightened  anxiety,  impacting  their  ability  to  make the most of their personal life. Their desire to avoid feeling  inferior ends up making them  feel  inferior  when  it  comes  to  their  diminished  capacity  for  friendship  and  leisure.  They end up dissatisfied both at work and outside of it.
　　　But  thankfully,  for  those  people  compelled  almost  entirely  by  this  specific  form  of motivation, the news isn't all bad, or bad at all. The study also discovered several positive  outcomes  that  can  actually  outweigh  the  harmful  ones.  Though  these  types  of employees  are motivated by the desire to avoid negative consequences,they are also motivated by the  excitement of pursuing emotional rewards. This excitement makes pursuing goals enjoyable and  stimulates pleasure and pride that would result from success. An effect of the positive motivation is that it neutralizes the existence of negative motivation.
　　　Sure, it  affects people's personal lives to what  could be  deemed  an unhealthy  extent, because leisure activities are often seen as a part of life that must be sacrificed to manage work and family demands. However, the way people feel about their work has less to do with whether they're motivated by  the preservation  of self-esteem but more with  the  fact that they're  simply motivated.
46. What does the author say about the pursuit of work-related self-esteem?
A)It may result in negative motivation.
C) It can increase one's vigor as one keeps trying.
B)It  contributes  to one's  accomplishments.
D)It costs too much emotionally and psychologically.
47.What do employees tend to do in pursuing work-related self-esteem?
A) Take on tasks well beyond their actual capabilities.
C) Resort to all means regardless of the consequences.
B) Strive to succeed at the expense of their well-being. D)Exaggerate their sense of shame and worthlessness.
48. What do we learn about people over-concerned with work-related self-esteem?
A)They may often feel inferior to their colleagues.
C) They are never satisfied with their  achievements.
B) They cannot enjoy their personal life to the full.
D) They have their own view of friendship and leisure.
49.What is the good news we learn from the recent research?
A) The pursuit of goals may turn out to be enjoyable and pleasant.
B) The emotional rewards from goal pursuit are worth the pains taken.
C) The negative consequences of goal pursuit can mostly be avoided.
D) The goal of swelling self-esteem can be achieved if one keeps trying.
50.What can we infer from the last paragraph?
A)Workers  have  to make  sacrifices to preserve self-esteem.
B)Self-esteem  swells when workers  are  strongly motivated.

　C) Pursuit of goals affects people's personal lives to an unhealthy extent. D)People feel positive about their work as long as they are motivated.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Degradation  of the  world's  natural  resources by humans  is rapidly  outpacing  the planet's  ability  to  absorb the  damage,a recent UN  environmental  study has  found. The study concludes that without radical action the level of prosperity that millions of people in  the developed world count on will be impossible to maintain or extend to poorer countries.
　　　Water scarcity is the curse of some of the poorest regions on Earth, leaving developing countries  increasingly unable to  feed themselves,  and  causing hardship  for millions  of  people. There appears little prospect of this desperate situation being remedied without  radical action being taken. Water resources are under increasing threat from population  growth,    climate    change,rapid    urbanization,rising    levels   of    consumption,and    the degradation of lands that previously provided a natural replenishment ( 补 充 )of water
resources.
　　　The rate of damage to the natural environment was found to increase globally, despite concerted efforts to persuade government to take measures to improve the condition.“If current  trends  continue,and  the  world  fails  to  improve  patterns  of  production  and consumption, then the state of the world's environment will continue to decline,”warned
UN executive director Achim Steiner.
He said the tools for improving the environment for millions of people existed in
developed countries, but were in danger of not being used.
　　　The study found that basic measures to tackle some of the key causes of environmental damage were still not being taken. These included measures to reduce air pollution; to  control the damage to marine ecosystems, which can have a huge effect on fish stocks on  which hundreds of millions of people depend; and to curb the degradation of land where  modem agricultural methods were pursued without regard to the longer-term consequences.
　　　Despite  the  recent global  agreement  on  cutting  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  global carbon output continues to rise. This will put a long-term strain on the ability of developing economies to feed their own people. Climate change is  aggravated by the emissions  of greenhouse gases from chemical and natural fertilisers used in agriculture which increased   by more than a quarter between 2000 and 2010.Other problem areas identified in the report included glaciers, which provide vital water resources for millions of people, but which are  shrinking as the climate warms.
　　　In  rich  countries,  these problems  have built up  over  decades  and  centuries  while economic growth was pursued at the expense of the environment.Subsequent efforts to remedy the environment have met with partial success. But in developing countries,the path   of  future   development   has   more   potential   to   change,which   has   encouraged

international institutions to devise more sustainable growth pathways that are supposed
both to alleviate poverty and preserve the environment.
51.What is the major finding of the UN environmental study?
A)Human activity has rendered Mother Earth almost uninhabitable.
B) Humans are doing more damage to the earth than it can cope with.
C) Environmental problems have considerably weakened human prosperity.   D)Environmental damage is more serious in developed countries these days.
52. What is said about water scarcity in some of the poorest regions? A)It is getting so serious that there is little hope of solution.
B) It largely accounts for their slow economic development.
C) It can hardly be relieved if no drastic measures are taken.
D)It is primarily caused by the acceleration of climate change.
53.What  does  Achim   Steiner  say  about the  environmental condition?
A)It will deteriorate worldwide.
B)It is attracting global attention.
C)It is being slowly remedied globally.
D) It will shrink the world's population.
54.What is the dilemma developing countries face?
A)They cannot modernise farming without causing land degradation.
B) They cannot promote industrialisation without polluting waterways.
C) They cannot boost crop yields without causing greenhouse gas emissions.
D) They cannot catch up with rich countries without sacrificing the environment.
55. What  should  developing  countries  do in their  future  development  according to the
passage?
A) They turn to developed countries for the assistance they need.
B) They remedy environmental damage by slowing economic growth.
C) They avoid damaging interference from international institutions.
D) They improve people's livelihood without harming the environment.

　　　The  task  of the  global  strategist  of a  business  is  to  build  a  platform  of capabilities derived  from  the  resources,  experiences  and  innovations  of  units  operating  in  multiple locations,  to  transplant  those  capabilities  wherever    26  ,and  then  to   systematically upgrade and renew them—ahead of the competition.
　　　Apple  is  an  outstanding  case  of  a  company  whose  unique  capabilities  give  it  a worldwide     27   advantage,   particularly with respect to  its  ability to build platforms from a product base that integrates functional and    28   design.Apple  has  been  able  to leverage  and  exploit  its  California-based  design  and  marketing  advantages  successfully throughout   the   world.   IKEA   is   another   such   case.   The   do-it-yourself  furniture   and  houseware company first developed a compelling set of capabilities to design, manufacture and     29   furniture  at  low  cost  and  sell  it  in  a  novel  way  in  Sweden.Later,IKEA successfully     30  this  formula  in many  other  countries.
　　　By   contrast,   Telefonica,a   Spanish   telecommunications   company   that   is   now   the world's  fifth  largest  telecom  by   31   ,first  developed  its  special  advantage  abroad.  In 1989 and  1990, Telefonica had the opportunity to enter Chile and Argentina, countries that  shared  many   institutional   and   cultural   characteristics  with   its  home   country  but  that were     32   .more  rapid  market  reform.  Throughout  the  1990s,  Telefonica  took  what  it learned  in  Chile  and Argentina  about reconstructing  former  state-owned telecoms to  other Latin  American  countries  that  were  privatizing  their  state  telecoms  and  deregulating  their
telecom  markets.
　　　These examples might lead the reader to believe that creating a global advantage is an easy  task.  But  many  other   33   of expensive failed experiments suggest that creating a lasting global advantage actually requires a great deal of   34  and   operational   finesse (技巧) . Our research suggests that global winners typically create and sustain their international  presence  through  a  systematic  process  of    35   ,renewing   and   enhancing their core capabilities.

Fear of Nature: An Emerging Threat to Conservation
A)What do we lose when natural spaces and species disappear? Increasingly, research has
shown  that  as  species  and  ecosystems  vanish,  it  also  chips  away  at  our  ability  to preserve what remains—because we no longer understand what we're losing.
B)You probably see it all the time. The neighbor who puts pesticides on his lawn rather than  deal with  annoying bees.  The politician who votes  against wildlife protection because she's never seen a wolf in the wild.The corporation that wants to bulldoze(用 推土机推平)the habitat of a rare frog.
C)At  best  this can be termed “the extinction of experience,”where our cultural and natural histories fade from our memories and therefore our reality. At its worst it becomes  something even more concerning:“biophobia,”the fear of living things and a complete
aversion to nature.
D)This isn't the fiction of living in a cold, empty dystopia (绝望的世界).Sadly,it's becoming a way of life for too many people—especially children.A recent study in   Japan paints a striking portrait of this problem. A survey of more than 5,300 school   children in the Tochigi Prefecture examined their perception of 14 local insect species   and one spider. The results? A collective“ew!”Most of the students saw the species as  things to dislike or fear, or even as sources of danger. The less experience the students had with nature, the more negative their feelings.
E)The results were published earlier this year in the journal Biological Conservation. Lead researcher Masashi Soga with the University  of Tokyo says  the study stemmed from observations   about   today's   nature-deficient   children.“Humans   inherently   avoid  dangerous organisms such as bees, but children these days avoid even harmless insects  such as  butterflies and dragonflies(蜻蜓), ”he  says.“I  have  long  wondered  why  so many of today's children react like this.”
F)Although the children's reactions were somewhat expected, the new study did contain  an unexpected finding: Many of the surveyed children revealed that their parents also  expressed fear or disgust of the  same  animals.In  fact  these  parental  emotions  were  strong enough to overwhelm any positive experiences the children might have gained   from direct experiences in nature. As Soga and his coauthors wrote in their paper,“Our   results suggest that there is likely a feedback loop in which an increase in people who  have negative attitudes towards nature in one generation will lead to a further increase in people with similar attitudes in the next generation.”
G)And that's possibly the greater threat posed by extinction of experience. Soga suggests the   generational   loss—condition   previously   dubbed   environmental   generational  amnesia(遗忘)—could chip away at our societal ability to preserve what we're losing. “I   believe   that   increased   biophobia   is   a   major,but   invisible,threat   to   global  biodiversity,”Soga  says.“As  the  number  of children  who  have biophobia increases, public  interest  and  support  for  biodiversity  conservation  will  gradually  decline.  Although many conservation biologists still consider that preventing the loss of wildlife habitat is the most important way to conserve biodiversity, I think preventing increased  biophobia is also important for conservation.”
H)What's  to be  done  about this?  The paper makes  several recommendations, the most
obvious of which is that children should experience nature more often. The authors also suggest  establishing  policies  to  guide  these  natural  experiences  and  increasing educational programs about the natural world.

I) Helping parents to see species around them in a new light would make a difference, too. And, of course, maintaining support for preserving the wild spaces where these“scary”" creatures live is the most important thing of all. That's a point reinforced by another recent study, which found that wild spaces located within urban areas—and the plants and  animals  that  thrive  in  them-are  particularly  important  for  human  health  and well-being.
J) Published in the journal Frontiers in Sustainable Cities, the study examined attitudes toward   Discovery   Park,the   heavily   forested   534-acre   public   park   in   Seattle, Washington. It found that the public had the most appreciation for-and gained the most value  from-the  wildest  parts  of  the  park.“I  have  seen  whales,seals,  fish,  eagles, shorebirds and many other sea creatures in their natural habitat,”one survey participant wrote.“Coming here with people has allowed me to connect and talk with them about conversation that simply does not happen in everyday life,”wrote another.
K)The  participants  reported  that  their  most  valuable  experiences  in  the  park  included encountering wildlife, walking through open spaces, exploring the beach and finding beautiful views.“We saw that a large majority of participants' interactions, especially their most meaningful interactions, depended on Discovery Park's relative wildness,” says lead author Elizabeth Lev, a master's student in the University of Washington's  Human Interaction with Nature Lab. This is only possible because the park is relatively wild.After all, you can't enjoy watching birds if there are no birds to follow, gaze at the  sunset if it's obscured by skyscrapers; or stop and smell the flowers if they don't have room to grow.
L)And yet even this long-protected space could someday become less hospitable to nature. Over the past few years a lot of people and  organizations have suggested developing parts of Discovery Park or the neighboring area. Most recently a plan proposed building 34 acres of much-needed affordable housing and parking spaces adjacent to the park, bringing with them noise, traffic and pollution.
M)If anything  like  that  happened, both  the park  and  the people  of Seattle  could  lose something vital. And that would continue the trend of chipping away at Seattle's—and the world's—natural spaces, leaving just tiny pocket parks and green-but-empty spaces that offer little real value to wildlife, plants or people.
N)“It is true that any interaction with nature is better than none, but I don't want people to  be satisfied with any small bit of grass and trees,”Lev says.“We have been in this cycle  of  environmental  generational  amnesia  for  a  long  time,where  the  baseline  keeps  shifting and we don't even realize what we're losing until it's gone. If we can get people  to  understand how much meaning and value can come from having more experiences with more wild forms  of nature, then maybe we can stop this cycle and move toward conserving and restoring what we have left.”
O)Building this understanding in an ever-more fearful and disconnected world may be the biggest challenge. Peter Kahn, the senior author of Lev's paper and the director of the Human Interaction with Nature lab, made several suggestions for bridging this gap in  this 2011 book, Technological Nature. They  echo the recommendation about getting children into nature, but also include telling stories of how things used to be, imagining
what things might be like in the future, and developing a common language about
nature,“a   way   of speaking  about  wild  and  domestic  interaction  patterns,  and  the
meaningful, deep and often joyful feelings that they generate.”
P)No matter what techniques we use, this growing field of research illustrates that saving 2022年12月英语六级真题第2套第6页共10页 by: 光速考研

nature requires encouraging people to experience it more often and more deeply. That calls for additional research-Lev and her coauthors have published a toolkit that other municipalities  can  follow  to  study  the  value  of their  own  wild  spaces—and  clear communication of the results.“If we can continue to show people the benefits of these wild spaces,”Lev says,“maybe people will begin to see more value in keeping these areas undeveloped—for the sake of our mutual benefit.”
36.A new study found parents'aversion to certain animals would pass on to their children.
37. The disappearance of species and ecological systems erodes our ability to keep what is
left.
38.A study showed that the wildest areas of Discovery Park appealed most to the public.
39. The fear of living organisms is becoming more worrisome.
40.  Preventing  the  increase  in  children's  fear  of living  creatures  is  also  important  for conserving biodiversity.
41. Research shows that more and deeper experience people have with nature will help save
it.
42. Though humans naturally tend to avoid dangerous animals, today's children try to stay away from even harmless ones.
43.Development in and around Discovery Park could cause heavy losses to the park and
the      local      residents.

Section       C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each  of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Some people in the US have asserted that forgiving student loan debt is one way to stimulate the economy and give assistance to those in need.One government proposition is  to eliminate $10,000 of debt for ‘economically distressed' students. Some in US Congress  have gone so far as to suggest forgiving up to $50,000 in debt per student borrower, but  does forgiving student debt necessarily correlate to helping the economically disadvantaged?
　　　The answer is no. This policy is just giving money away to universities and the most affluent students in attendance. Federal Reserve  data reveals that the highest-income 40 percent of households owe approximately 60 percent of outstanding student debt, while the  lowest 40 percent owe just under 20 percent. This could be due to a combination of factors: students from high-income households are more likely to go to expensive colleges, less  likely to receive financial aid, and more likely to have high incomes post-graduation.Plus, the majority of student debt is held by graduate degree earners, who earn approximately 25

percent more than their undergraduate counterparts. Clearly, giving free reign to banks to forgive student debt is a step in the wrong direction.
　　　Other proposals  for   broader,long-term  student loan plans have  some  fundamental problems.  One  idea  is  to  cancel  student  debt  only  for  undergraduate  degrees  and for  students making less than $125,000.
　　　This  attempts to  address the  fact that  Congress'previously mentioned  student  loan  forgiveness plan largely helps out the wealthy, but is an adverse incentive for universities to  keep raising tuition and for students to choose to major in low-earning degree programs.  Colleges have no reason to make their programs more affordable if they believe students  will  just  take  out  more  debt.  And,students  will  feel  more  comfortable  making  the  irresponsible decision to go tens of thousands of dollars in debt to major in  impractical or idealistic subjects if they know their loans will be forgiven.
　　　This is especially concerning given the pandemic(大流行病)has rendered a college education practically worthless. Students are paying tens of thousands of dollars per year to live at home and be lectured on the Internet. Do we really want to tell colleges that they can get away with providing below-average service for an outrageous  cost?
　　　In the case of any of these student debt plans, working-class Americans who chose not to or could not afford to go to college will be subsidizing the education of the professional  class. Plumbers and retail workers will  be paying for the degrees of doctors and lawyers
　　　The US government's effort to help those in debt is commendable but is this really the solution that will help the poor financially recover?
46.Why do some people advocate forgiving student loan debt?
A)They assert it will narrow the gap between the wealthy and the poor.
B) They believe it will benefit both the economy and the underprivileged.  C) They claim it will eliminate economic distress among college students.   D)They think the cost of education is the responsibility of the government.
47.What do we learn from the Federal Reserve data?
A)Approximately 60% of student debt remains unpaid.
B) Cancelling student debt benefits wealthy families most.
C) Forgiving student debt provides little benefit to universities.
D)Low-income families owe the biggest amount of student debt.
48. What does the author say students are likely to do if they know they needn't repay their loans?
A)They will choose to study subjects without considering their job prospects. B) They will be free to pursue their goals without being burdened financially. C)They will over-borrow and live beyond their means.
D) They will be able to enroll in expensive universities.
49. What does the author imply about colleges offering online education?
A)They cannot get away with the serious consequences.
B) They have suffered greatly from the current pandemic.
2022年12月英语六级真题第2套第8页共10页 by: 光速考研

C) The tuition they charge is not justified by the quality of their service.
D) The tuition they charge has surged outrageously during the pandemic.
50.What will happen if any of the proposed student debt plans is implemented?
A)Plumbers and retail workers will have a chance of becoming professionals.
B)Working-class students will have increasing access to subsidized education.
C) Blue-collar workers will have to bear the cost of educating would-be high-earners. D)A growing number of students will be able to earn degrees in medicine and law.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　If there's one rule that most parents cling to in the confusing, fast-changing world of kids and media, it's“No screens before age 2.”
As of today, that rule has been thrown out the window.
　　　The American Academy of Pediatrics(AAP),which first issued that recommendation back  in   1999,has  extensively  updated  and  revised  its  guidelines  for  children  and adolescents to reflect new research and new habits.
　　　The new guidelines, especially for very young children, shift the focus from WHAT is on the screen to WHO else is in the room. And in doing so, they raise some intriguing points about the future of learning from media.
　　　For babies younger than  18  months, AAP still says no screens at all are the best  idea—with one notable exception: Live video chat. Surveys indicate that families already  popularly believe that“Face time doesn't count”, or at least that the benefit of virtual visits with grandparents or other relatives outweighs the potential cost of exposing babies to the  laptop or smartphone.
　　　The AAP doesn't cite positive evidence that infants actually get something out of this  kind of“conversation",the way that they clearly do from live social interaction. But there's  some  observational  research  that  infants  as  young  as  six  months  old  are  emotionally engaged by playing live peekaboo(躲猫猫)with Grandma online.
　　　For infants and toddlers(学步儿童),ages 15 months to 2 years old,there's limited evidence  from  a  couple  of very  small  studies  that  they  can  learn  new  words  from educational media, if and only if parents are watching alongside them, repeating what the video says and/or drawing attention to what is on the screen. In other words, treating a video or an app like a picture book is the best bet.
　　　The flip side of this is that many studies have actually shown poorer language skills correlated  with  earlier  solo  viewing  of“educational”videos.  There's  also  research  that  shows language delays in children who watch more TV and start watching earlier. In both cases, the problem seems to be media replacing interaction with people. For this reason, the  new AAP guideline has changed from“avoid all screens under age 2”to“avoid solo media  use in this age group.”
　　　For  preschoolers  ages  2  to  5,there's  more  evidence  that  they  have  the  ability  to transfer knowledge from screens to the real world, including early literacy and math. For

2022年12月英语六级真题第2套第9页共10页 by: 光速考研

this age group, AAP recommends no more than an hour a day of screen use.And, just as with  younger  children,  they  want  care-givers  to  take  part  in  screen  time:“Co-view  with your  children,  help  children  understand  what  they  are  seeing,  and  help  them  apply  what they learn to the world around them.”
51.What do we learn about the "No screens under 2" rule?
A)It has met more and more resistance from parents.
B)It has proved helpful to children's healthy growth.
C) It confuses parents with regard to kids' education.
D)It has been discarded in line with recent research.
52.What do the new AAP guidelines advocate?
A)Young children should be accompanied by parents during screen time. B)Parents should be emotionally involved in their children's upbringing.
C)Young children should watch videos carefully selected by parents.
D)Parents should protect their children from too much media exposure.
53.What do families think of live video chat according to surveys?
A)It should not be regarded as screen time.
B) It helps babies to develop their verbal skills.
C) It is not as harmful as playing games on laptops.
D) It is a good substitute for video viewing.
54.What do researches find about kids solo viewing educational videos?
A)It arouses their interest in language learning.
B)It works no better than reading picture books.
C) It hampers their development of language skills.
D)It  helps them acquire independent learning skills.
55.What does the author say about preschoolers ages 2 to 5?
A)They can understand pretty well what they see on the screen.
B) They can learn on their own without much parental guidance.
C) They can make use of educational videos to develop digital literacy.
D) They can relate what they learn on the screen to real life situations.

　　　American  colleges  and  universities  are  using  64  percent  less  coal  than  they  did  a   decade   ago,   burning  700,000  tons  last  year,  down  from  2  million  tons  in   2008,the   U.S.
Energy  Information      Administration(EIA) said  in  a  report  26  yesterday.
　All    57    schools   that   were   burning   coal   in   2008   are   using   less   now,and   20 have     27  coal   completely,   EIA   found.
Most  universities  have  turned  to  natural  gas  as  a   28   ,with   state  funding  backing
the  fuel  switch.
　　　While  academic  institutions  use  less  than  0.1  percent  of U.S.  coal  burned  for  power, campus  coal use has  a history  dating back to the  1800s when     29 to   power  was  scarce.
　　　Many  universities  still  operate  their  own  power  plants.  The  Public  Utility  Regulatory Policies   Act   of   1978   encouraged   more   electricity   generation   by   allowing   institutions   to sell     30   . power to utilities.
　　　But  EIA  noted  many  coal-fired  universities  have  signed  onto  the  American  College and  University  Presidents  Climate  Commitment,  which  was  launched  in  2007.
About  665  schools  are  part  of  the  program,  which  aims  to   31   greenhouse      gas
emissions.  Thirty  percent  of the  participants  have  pledged  to  be  carbon   32   within    20

Classical music aims to evolve, build audiences without alienating old guard
A) In  1913,classical  music  sparked  a  riot  in  Paris.Igor  Stravinsky  was  introducing  his revolutionary“Rite  of Spring”ballet  to  the  world,  with  its  discordant  melodies  and unorthodox choreography ( 编 舞 ) ,and the purists in the crowd expressed their disapproval loud and clear.It might have been classical music's version of the time Bob Dylan went electric at the Newport Folk Festival.“The noise, fighting, and shouting in the audience got so loud,”NPR's music reporter Miles Hoffiman said of the Stravinsky debut,“that the choreographer had to shout out the numbers to the dancers so that they knew what they were supposed to do.”
B)It's    difficult to  imagine a similar disturbance  occurring today within America's sacred symphony halls. In fact, it's hard to picture any kind of disruptive activity at all (unless  someone's cell phone happens to go off, and then you'd better watch your back). A  mannerly aura(氛围)hangs over most classical proceedings, and many of the genre's biggest supporters would have it no other way.
C)Today, Western audiences for classical music and opera and ballet are almost always   well dressed, older, respectful,achingly silent and often very wealthy (one has to be   able to afford most tickets). But as many of America's most storied“highbrow”(高雅的) institutions struggle financially—the Philadelphia Orchestra's much-publicized rebound   from bankruptcy is just one recent example—classical music fans and theorists are   wondering how the medium  can weave itself into the 21st century's  cultural  fabric   without sacrificing its integrity.
D)For  example,  should  we  feel  OK“clapping”during  classical  music  events,  even  if nobody else is? Why shouldn't we cheer for something great, like we do at a rock

concert?  The Huffington Post recently ran  a  Great Debate  on this  issue  and many commenters came out on the side of silence.“There is no more rewarding experience in life than being part of an  audience where  everybody is leaning  forward in  silence, thoroughly  carried  away by  a  great performance  of a masterpiece,”one  commenter wrote.“Why is it so difficult for folks to develop an appreciation and understanding for
the mannerisms and traditions of classical music?”asked another.
E) The truth is that classical music audiences weren't always so  polite. Robert Greenberg, an  award-winning  composer,  said  that  when  Beethoven  first  performed  his  7th  Symphony, audiences forced the orchestra to perform encores ( 重 演 )of certain movements immediately, applauding wildly. And in the last few decades, he said, many audiences at opera performances have abandoned pretenses, yelling“Bravo”when they
feel like it.
F)“I don't think there's anything wrong with an audience showing their  enthusiasm for a proper  moment  by  applauding,  showing  their joy,”Greenberg  said,  noting  that  the  stuffiness in concert halls is“one aspect of contemporary concert etiquette”he doesn't  understand.“Instead of waiting half an hour to show enthusiasm, why not show it every eight or nine minutes?”
G)Until  the  rules  about behavior and clothing change, it's hard to imagine multitudes  of young people filling concert halls on their own accord. They're probably more likely to   head to Central Park to watch a free performance with a bottle of wine and their friends.  “I think anyone should be able to come into a performance dressed any way they like,   and  be comfortable any way they like, sitting in that seat ready to enjoy themselves,” Greenberg said.“Because it's enjoyable.”
H)Greenberg stressed that he doesn't want people to  start respecting the music  less,and 	he's not suggesting that we“dumb down”the experience. Rather, it's about opening up  “access.”When operas first instituted subtitles( 字 幕 )during shows, he said, many 	purists didn't like the idea, believing that the audience should instead study the works  	before attending. But now it's commonplace to find titles on the seatback in front of 	you—choose a language, sit back,and understand  what's going on.
I) Allison Vulgamore, president of the Philadelphia Orchestra, is certainly looking to the future.  She  says  certain“classics  concerts”dedicated  to  the  old  masters  will  always exist, but not every program has to feature Beethoven and Brahms—or even a stage and seats.“We're trying to introduce different kinds of concerts in different ways,”she said.  “We are an interactive society now, where people like to learn.”
J) As the Philadelphia Orchestra rebounds from its financial straits, it is also aiming to experiment,  without  alienating  the  loyalists.  Vulgamore  pointed  to  Cirque  de  la  Symphonie, a recent offering in whichjugglers(玩杂耍的人)and acrobats(杂技演员) interacted with musicians. An upcoming collaboration with New York City's Ridge  Theatre, meanwhile, will  feature  a“suspended  dance  installation”and  other  theatrical elements occurring in conjunction with an orchestral piece.
K)The orchestra also continues to offer $25 annual memberships to Philadelphia students, who can buy rush tickets to every concert on the schedule.“Students line up for the concerts they want, and we get roughly 300 or 350 kids a night coming to these. They
2022年12月英语六级真题第3套第3页共8页 by: 光速考研

take  any  of the  open  seats  available,5  minutes  before  the  concert  starts,”Vulgamore said.“It's like the running of the bulls,that energy when the doors open.”
L)Greenberg  thinks  that  youthful  energy  needs  to  be  harvested.Conductors  don't  have  to  	be  arrogant  and  untouchable—they  can  be  accessible.  Perhaps  there  could  even  be  a   “bit  of humor”about  them,  he  suggested,  and  an  abandoning  of pretension  within  the  	high-art  institutions  themselves.“On  one  hand,  these  organizations  are  all  saying  the  	same thing: we want more general audiences, to break  down  cultural  barriers,”he  said. “But then they come up with some very snooty(目中无人的)thing that makes you 	crazy.”
M)John Terauds, a critic who has covered Toronto's classical music  scene extensively,also wants to do away with the stuffiness. He suggested that the warmer an audience is, the better  the  musicians  themselves will respond.“But the producer or organizer has to let everyone know  it's  OK,”he  said.“It's  OK to  enjoy yourself."At the  Toronto  Symphony  Orchestra,  for example, conductor Peter Oundjian often  stops between pieces, taking a  moment  to  talk  about  the  composer  or  the  music  in  a  very  amiable  way.  And  some  nights,  Terauds  said,“at  least  a  third”of the  audience  consists  of  students  who  have purchased  cheaper tickets.  On these nights, the  energy  of the room  drastically  shifts.It becomes a less intimidating place.
N)Back in February, Terauds wrote on his blog about how going to classical performances can be intimidating. Certain people “think they have to dress up,"he wrote.“They think they have to know something about the music before they go.And, I'm sure, sitting in a seat, trembling in fear that this might be the wrong time to applaud, is also one of the
factors.”
O)Everyone  in  the  classical  world  agrees on  the  need  for  increased“accessibility,”but achieving  it  is  often  easier  said  than  done.  Nowadays,there  are  unknown,  unorthodox opera singers wowing(博得 ……的喝彩) viewers on TV programs like“America's Got Talent” and“The Voice” .What can higher institutions do with any of that? And if they appeal to these outlets, do they risk compromising the integrity or the intelligence of the
music?
P)Vulgamore  seems to understand this.  She thinks  an  organization  can have it both ways, claiming  the  new  while  keeping  the  old.  And  as  she  reorganizes  the  Philadelphia Orchestra,  she  will  attempt  to  do  just  that.“The  world's  most  respected  musicians brought together as an orchestra will always exist,”she  said.“But  it's  essential  that  we be willing to experiment and fail.”
36.It was not  a rare  occurrence that  audiences behaved wildly while  listening to  classical
music.
37.Some high-art institutions don't actually mean it when they say they want more general

audiences.
38.The  theatre was  in  chaos when  an unconventional ballet was  first put  on  stage  in  the capital of France.
39.According  to  one  critic,  the  audience's  warm  response  would  encourage  the  musicians to do a better job.

Section       C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage  One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　How can one person enjoy good health, while another person looks old before her time? Humans have been asking this question for thousands of years, and recently, it's becoming   clearer and clearer to scientists that the differences between people's rates of aging lie in the   complex  interactions  among  genes,  social  relationships,  environments  and  lifestyles.  Even   though you were born with a particular set of genes, the way you live can influence how
they express themselves. Some lifestyle factors may even turn genes on or shut them  off.

　　　Deep within the genetic heart of all our cells are telomeres, or repeating segments of noncoding DNA that live at the ends of the chromosomes(染色体).They form caps at the ends of the chromosomes and keep the genetic material together. Shortening with each cell  division, they help  determine how  fast  a  cell  ages. When they become too  short, the  cell  stops dividing altogether. This isn't the only reason a cell can age—there are other stresses  on  cells  we  don't  yet  understand  very  well—but  short  telomeres  are  one  of the  major  reasons  human  cells  grow  old.We've  devoted  most  of our  careers  to  studying  telomeres,
and one extraordinary discovery from our labs is that telomeres can actually lengthen.
　　　Scientists  have  learned  that   several  thought  patterns  appear  to  be  unhealthy   for telomeres, and one of them is cynical hostility. Cynical hostility is defined by high anger  and  frequent  thoughts  that  other people  cannot be  trusted.  Someone with hostility  doesn't  just think,“I hate to  stand in long lines”; they think,“Others deliberately  sped up and beat me to my rightful position in the line!”—and then get violently agitated. People who score  high on measures of cynical hostility tend to get more heart disease, metabolic disease and
often  die  at  younger  ages.  They  also  have  shorter  telomeres.  In  a  study  of British  civil
2022年12月英语六级真题第3套第5页共8页 by: 光速考研

servants, men who scored high on measures of cynical hostility had  shorter telomeres than men whose hostility scores were low. The most hostile men were 30% more likely to have
short telomeres.
　　　What this  means: aging is a dynamic process that could possibly be accelerated or slowed—and, in some aspects, even reversed. To an extent, it has surprised us and the rest of the scientific community that telomeres do not simply carry out the commands issued by  your genetic code. Your telomeres are listening to you. The foods you eat, your response to challenges, the amount of exercise you get, and many other factors appear to influence your  telomeres and can prevent premature aging at the cellular level. One of the keys to enjoying
good health is simply doing your part to foster healthy cell renewal.
46.What have scientists come to know better today?
A)Why people age at different rates.
B) How genes influence the aging process.
C) How various genes express themselves in aging.
D)Why people have long been concerned about aging.
47.Why are some lifestyle factors considered extremely important?
A)They may shorten the process of cell division.
B) They may determine how genes function.
C) They may affect the lifespan of telomeres.
D)They may account for the stresses on cells.
48.What have the author and his colleagues discovered about telomeres?
A)Their number affects the growth of cells.
B) Their length determines the quality of life.
C) Their shortening process can be reversed.
D) Their health impacts the division of cells.
49. What have scientists learned about cynical hostility?
A) It may lead to confrontational thought patterns. B)It may produce an adverse effect on telomeres.
C) It may cause people to lose their temper frequently. D)It may stir up agitation among those in long lines.
50.What do we learn from the last paragraph about the process of aging?
A)It may vary from individual to individual.
B) It challenges scientists to explore further.
C) It depends on one's genetic code. D)It may be controlled to a degree.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
Scientists have created by accident an enzyme ( 酶 )that breaks down plastic drinks
2022年12月英语六级真题第3套第6页共8页 by: 光速考研

bottles. The breakthrough could help solve the global plastic pollution crisis by enabling for
the first time the full recycling of bottles.
　　　The new research was spurred by the discovery in 2016 of the first bacterium that had naturally evolved to eat plastic at a waste dump in Japan. Scientists have now revealed the detailed structure of the crucial enzyme produced by the bug.
　　　An  international  team then adjusted the enzyme to  see how it had evolved, but tests showed they had accidentally made the molecule  even better at breaking down the plastic  used for drinks bottles.“What actually turned out was we improved the enzyme, which was  a  bit  of a  shock,”said  head  researcher  Prof.  McGeehan,  at  the  University  of Portsmouth,
UK.
　　　Currently, the  enzyme takes  a  few  days to  start breaking  down the plastic,  far  faster than  the  centuries  it  takes  in  the  oceans,  but  the  researchers  are  optimistic  this  can  be speeded up even further and become a viable large-scale process.
　　　“What we are hoping to do is use this enzyme to turn this plastic back into its original components,  so  we  can  literally  recycle  it  back  to  plastic,”said  McGeehan.“It  means  we  won't  need  to  dig  up  any  more  oil  and,  fundamentally,  it  should  reduce  the  amount  of  plastic in the environment.”
　　　About  1 million plastic bottles  are  sold  each minute  around the  globe  and, with just 14% recycled, many end up in the oceans where they have polluted even the remotest parts,  harming marine life and potentially people who eat sea food.“Plastic is incredibly resistant  to  degradation,”said  McGeehan.“It  is  one of these wonder materials that has been made a
little bit too well.”
　　　Currently  those  bottles  that  are  recycled  can  only  be  turned  into  opaque  fibres  for clothing  or  carpets,while  the  new  enzyme  indicates  a  way  to  recycle  old  clear  plastic  bottles back into new clear plastic bottle.
　　　“You are always up against the fact oil is cheap,  so  plastic  is  cheap,”said  McGeehan. “It  is  so  easy  for  manufacturers  to  generate  more  of that  stuff,  rather  than  even  try  to  recycle, but  I believe there  is  a public  interest here: perception  is  changing  so much that  companies are starting to look at how they can properly recycle these bottles.”
　　　Prof. Adisa Azapagic,  at the University  of Manchester in the UK,agreed the  enzyme could be useful but added:“A full life-cycle assessment would be needed to ensure that the technology  does  not  solve  one  environmental  problem—waste—at  the  expense  of others, including  additional greenhouse gas  emissions.”
51.What do we learn from the passage about an enzyme scientists have created? A)It was identified during a lab experiment  accident.
B) It may make full recycling of plastic bottles a reality.
C) It was a breakthrough made with persistent efforts. D)It may initiate a radical reform in plastic industry.
52. What does the passage say about the bug that produces the important enzyme?
A)It has a natural ability to consume plastics.

　　　Unthinkable as it may be, humanity, every last person, could someday be wiped from the face of the Earth. We have learned to worry about asteroids (小行星) and super volcanoes, but the more likely 26 , according to Nick Bostrom, a professor of philosophy at Oxford, is that we humans will destroy ourselves.
　　　Professor Bostrom, who directs Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute, has argued over the course of several papers that human 27 risks are poorly understood and, worse still, 28  underestimated by society. Some of these existential risks are fairly well known, especially the natural ones. But others are 29 or even exotic. Most worrying to Bostrom is the subset of existential risks that 30  from human technology, a subset that he expects to grow in number and potency over the next century.
　　　Despite his concerns about the risks	31 to humans by technological progress, Bostrom is no luddite (科技进步反对者). In fact, he is a longtime  32  of trans-humanism—the effort to improve the human condition, and even human nature itself,through technological means. In the long run he sees technology as a bridge, a bridge we humans must cross with great care, in order to reach new and better modes of being. In his work, Bostrom uses the tools of philosophy and mathematics, in  33  , probability theory, to try and determine how we as a	34 might achieve this safe passage.

San Francisco Has Become One Huge Metaphor for Economic Inequality in America
A)	The fog still chills the morning air and the cable cars still climb halfway to the stars. Yet on the ground, the Bay area has changed greatly since singer Tony Bennett left his heart here. Silicon Valley and the tech industry have led the region into a period of unprecedented wealth and innovation.But existing political and land limits have caused an alarming housing crisis and astronomical rise in social and economic difference.
B)	While the residents of most cities display pride and support for their home industries, drastic market distortions in the San Francisco Bay Area have created boiling resentment in the region towards the tech industry. A vocal minority is even calling on officials to punish those who are benefitting from the economic and housing boom. If this boom and its consequences are not resolved, a drastic increase in social and economic difference may have a profound impact on the region for generations. A history and analysis of this transformation may hold invaluable insights about the opportunities. Perils of tech cities are currently being cultivated across the US, and indeed around the world.
C)	According to a recent study, San Francisco ranks first in California for economic difference. The average income of the top 1% of households in the city averages $3.6 million. This is 44 times the average income of those at the bottom, which stands at $81,094. The top 1% of the San Francisco peninsula’s share of total income now extends to 30.8% of the region’s income. This was a dramatic jump from 1989, where it stood at 15.8%.
D)	The region’s economy has been fundamentally transformed by the technology industry springing from Silicon Valley. Policies pushed by Mayor Ed Lee provided tax breaks for tech companies to set up shop along the city’s long-neglected Mid-Market area. The city is now home to Twitter, Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest, Dropbox and others. In short, the Bay Area has become a global magnet for those with specialized skills, which has in turn helped fuel economic enthusiasm, and this economic growth has reduced unemployment to 3.4%, an admirable feat.
E)	In spite of all that, the strength of the recent job growth, combined with policies that have traditionally limited housing development in the city and throughout the peninsula, did not help ease the affordability crisis. In 2015 alone, the Bay Area added 64,000 in jobs. In the same year, only 5,000 new homes were built.
F)	With the average house in the city costing over $1.25 million and average flat prices over $1.11 million, the minimum qualifying income to purchase a house has increased to $254,000. Considering that the average household income in the city currently stands at around $80,000, it is not an exaggeration to say that the dream of home ownership is now beyond the grasp of the vast majority of today’s people who rent.
G)	For generations, the stability and prosperity of the American middle class has been anchored by home ownership. Studies have consistently shown that the value of land has overtaken overall income growth, thus providing a huge advantage to property owners as a vehicle of wealth building. When home prices soar above the reach of most households, the gap between the rich and the poor dramatically increases.
H)	If contributing factors leading to housing becoming less than affordable are not resolved over multiple generations, a small elite will control a vast share of the country's total wealth. The result? A society where the threat of class warfare would loom large. A society’s level of happiness is tied less to measures of quantitative wealth and more to measures of qualitative wealth. This means that how a person judges their security in comparison to their neighbors’ has more of an impact on their happiness than their objective standard of living. At the same time, when a system no longer provides opportunities for the majority to participate in wealth building, it not only robs those who are excluded from opportunities, but also deprives them of their dignity.
I) 	San Francisco and the Bay Area have long been committed to values which embrace inclusion and rejection of mainstream culture.To see these values coming apart so publicly adds insult to injury for a region once defined by its progressive social fabric. In the face of resentment, it is human to want revenge.But deteriorating policies such as heavily taxing technology companies or real estate developers are not likely to shift the balance.
J) 	The housing crisis is caused by two primary factors: the growing desirability of the Bay Area as a place to live due to its excellent economy, and our limited housing stock. Although the city is experiencing an unprecedented boom in new housing, more units are sorely needed.Protection policies were originally designed to suppress bad development and boost historic preservation in our urban areas. Now, too many developers are experiencing excessive delays.Meanwhile, there are the land limitations of the Bay Area to consider. The region is surrounded by water and mountains. Local governments need to aid development as well. This means increasing housing density throughout the region and building upwards while streamlining the approval process.
K)	Real estate alone will not solve the problem, of course. Transportation, too, needs to be updated and infrastructure extended to link distant regions to Silicon Valley and the city. We need to build an effective high-speed commuting system linking the high-priced and crowded Bay Area with the low-priced and low-density Central Valley. This would dramatically reduce travel times. And based on the operating speeds of hovering trains used in countries such as Japan or Spain, high-speed rail could shorten the time to travel between San Francisco and California’s capital, Sacramento, or from Stockton to San Jose, to under 30 minutes. This system would bring once distant regions within reasonable commute to heavy job centers. The city also needs to update existing transportation routes combined with smart home-building policies that dramatically increase housing density in areas surrounding high-speed rail stations. By doing so, we will be able to build affordable housing within acceptable commuting distances for a significant bulk of the workforce.
L)	Our threatening housing crisis forces the difficult question of what type of society we would like to be. Will it be one where the elite command the vast bulk of wealth and regional culture is defined by an aggressive business world? We were recently treated to a taste of the latter, when local tech employee Justin Keller wrote an open letter to the city complaining about having to see homeless people on his way to work.
M)	It doesn’t have to be this way. But solutions need to be implemented now, before angry crowds grow from a nuisance to serious concern. It may take less than you might think. And in fact, the solutions to our housing crisis are already fairly clear. We need to increase the density of housing units. We need to use existing technology to shorten travel times and break the land limits. There is a way to solve complex social and economic problems without abandoning social responsibility. This is the Bay Area’s opportunity to prove that it can innovate more than just technology.
36. The higher rate of employment, combined with limited housing supply, did not make it any easier to buy a house.
37.	One way to deal with the housing crisis is for the government to simplify approval procedures for housing projects.
38.	Residents of the San Francisco Bay Area strongly resent the tech industry because of the economic inequality it has contributed to.
39.	The fast rise in the prices of land and houses increases the economic inequality among people.
40.	San Francisco city government offered tax benefits to attract tech companies to establish operations in a less developed area.
41.	Innovative solutions to social and economic problems should be introduced before it is too late.
42.	When people compare their own living standard with others’, it has a greater impact on their sense of contentment.
43. San Francisco has been found to have the biggest income gap in California between the rich and the poor.
44.	Improved transport networks connecting the city to distant outlying areas will also help solve the housing crisis.
45.	Average incomes in the Bay Area make it virtually impossible for most tenant families to buy a home. 
Section C 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A)  , B) , C) and D ). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
Passage One 
　　　The ability to make inferences from same and different, once thought to be unique to humans, is viewed as a cornerstone of abstract intelligent thought. A new study, however, has shown that what psychologists call same-different discrimination is present in creatures generally seen as unintelligent: newborn ducklings (小鸭) .
　　　The study, published Thursday in Science, challenges our idea of what it means to have a birdbrain, said Edward Wasserman, an experimental psychologist at the University of Iowa who wrote an independent review of the study.
　　　“In fact, birds are extremely intelligent and our problem pretty much lies in figuring out how to get them to ‘talk’ to us, or tell us how smart they really are,” he said.
　　　Antone Martinho and Alex Kacelnik, co-authors of the new paper, devised a clever experiment to better test bird intelligence.
　　　First, they took 1-day-old ducklings and exposed them to a pair of moving objects. The two objects were either the same or different in shape or color. Then they exposed each duckling to two entirely new pairs of moving objects.
　　　The researchers found that about 70% of the ducklings preferred to move toward the pair of objects that had the same shape or color relationship as the first objects they saw. A duckling that was first shown two green spheres, in other words, was more likely to move toward a pair of blue spheres than a mismatched pair of orange and purple spheres.
　　　Ducklings go through a rapid learning process called imprinting shortly after birth—it’s what allows them to identify and follow their mothers.
　　　These findings suggest that ducklings use abstract relationships between sensory inputs like color, shape, sounds and odor to recognize their mothers, said Dr. Kacelnik.
　　　By studying imprinting, the authors of this study have shown for the first time that an animal can learn relationships between concepts without training, said Jeffrey Katz, an experimental psychologist at Auburn University who was not involved in the study.
　　　Previous studies have suggested that other animals, including pigeons, dolphins, honeybees and some primates (灵长类动物), can discern same from different, but only after extensive training.
　　　Adding ducklings to the list—particularly untrained newborn ducklings—suggests that the ability to compare abstract concepts “is far more necessary to a wider variety of animals’ survival than we previously thought,” Dr. Martinho said.He believes the ability is so crucial because it helps animals consider context when identifying objects in their environment.
　　　It’s clear from this study and others like it that “animals process and appreciate far more of the intricacies in their world than we’ve ever understood,” Dr. Wasserman said. “We are in a revolutionary phase in terms of our ability to understand the minds of other animals.”
46. In what way were humans thought to be unique?
A)  Being a major source of animal intelligence.
B) Being the cornerstone of the creative world.
C) Being capable of same-different discrimination.
D) Being able to distinguish abstract from concrete.
47. What do we learn from the study published in Science?
A)  Our understanding of the bird world was biased.
B) Our conception of birds’ intelligence was wrong.
C) Our communication with birds was far from adequate.
D) Our knowledge about bird psychology needs updating.
48. What did the researchers discover about most ducklings from their experiment?
A)  They could associate shape with color.                         
B) They reacted quickly to moving objects. 
C) They preferred colored objects to colorless ones.
D) They could tell whether the objects were the same.    
49. What was novel about the experiment in the study reported in Science?
A)  The animals used received no training.
B) It used a number of colors and shapes.
C) It was conducted by experimental psychologists.
D) The ducklings were compared with other animals.
50. What do we learn from Dr. Wasserman’s comment on the study of animal minds at the end of the passage?
A)  It is getting more and more intricate.
B) Research methods are being updated.                           
C) It is attracting more public attention.
D) Remarkable progress is being made.


Passage Two 
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
The suggestion that people should aim for dietary diversity by trying to eat a variety of foods has been a basic public health recommendation for decades in the United States and elsewhere. Now, however, experts are warning that aiming for a diverse diet may actually lead to just eating more calories, and, thus, to obesity. One issue is that people may not interpret “variety” the way nutritionists intend. This problem is highlighted by new research conducted by the American Heart Association. Researchers reviewed all the evidence published related to dietary diversity and saw a correlation between dietary diversity and a greater intake of both healthy and unhealthy foods. This had implications for obesity, as researchers found a greater prevalence of obesity amongst people with a greater dietary diversity.
One author of the new study explained that their findings contradict standard dietary advice, as most dietary guidelines around the world include a statement of eating a variety of foods. But this advice does not seem to be supported by science, possibly because there is little agreement about the meaning of “dietary diversity,” which is not clearly and consistently defined. Some experts measure dietary diversity by counting the number of food groups eaten, while others look at the distribution of calories across individual foods, and still others measure how different the foods eaten are from each other.
Although the findings of this new study contradict standard dietary advice, they do not come as a surprise to all of the researchers involved. Dr. Rao, one of the study authors, noted that, after 20 years of experience in the field of obesity, he has observed that people who have a regimented lifestyle and diet tend to be thinner and healthier than people with a wide variety of consumption. This anecdotal evidence matches the conclusions of the study, which found no evidence that dietary diversity promotes healthy body weight or optimal eating patterns, and limited evidence that eating a variety of foods is actually associated with consuming more calories, poor eating patterns and weight gain. Further, there is some evidence that a greater variety of food options in a single meal may delay people’s feeling of fullness and actually increase how much they eat.
Based on their findings, the researchers endorse a diet consisting of a limited number of healthy foods such as vegetables, fruits, grains, and poultry. They also recommend that people simultaneously endeavor to restrict consumption of sweets, sugar and red meat. The researchers stress, however, that their dietary recommendations do not imply dietary diversity is never positive, and that, in the past, diversity in diets of whole, unprocessed food may have actually been very beneficial.
51. What has been a standard piece of dietary advice for decades?
A)  People should cultivate a healthy eating habit.
B) People should have a well-balanced diet.
C) People should diversify what they eat.
D) People should limit calorie intake to avoid obesity.
52. What did the new research by the American Heart Association find? 
A)  People seeking dietary diversity tend to eat more.
B) Big eaters are more likely to become overweight.
C) Dietary diversity is positively related to good health.
D) Unhealthy food makes people gain weight more easily.
53. What could help to explain the contradiction between the new findings and the common public health recommendation?
A)  Most dietary guidelines around the world contradict one another.
B) Conventional wisdom about diet is seldom supported by science.
C) The methods researchers use to measure nutrition vary greatly.
D) There is little consensus on the definition of dietary diversity.
54. What did Dr. Rao find after 20 years of research on obesity?
A)  Dietary diversity promotes healthy body weight.
B) Eating patterns and weight gain go hand in hand.
C) Diversified food intake may not contribute to health.
D) There is no clear definition of optimal eating patterns.
55. What does the passage say about people who eat a great variety of food?
A)  They tend to consume more sweets, sugar and red meat.
B) They don’t have any problems getting sufficient nutrition.
C) They don’t feel they have had enough until they overeat.
D) They are more likely to eat foods beneficial to their health.

Part III        Reading Comprehension                    (40 minutes)


Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.  You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
　　　Scientists recently examined studies on dog intelligence and compared them with research into the minds of other intelligent animals. The researchers found that dogs are among the more intelligent carnivores  ( 食 肉 动 物 ),  social  hunters  and  domestic  animals,  but  that  their  intelligence  does  not ___26___ other intelligent animals in any of those categories. Though a significant body of research has examined dog cognition ___27___, the authors of this new study found little to warrant the ___28___ of work that has been devoted to the topic.
　　　Stephen Lea, lead author of the new study, argues that many researchers seem to have designed their studies to ___29___ how clever dogs are, rather than simply to study dogs' brains. Lea and a colleague examined more than 300 studies of dog cognition, comparing the studies' results with those from research into other animals. The researchers made specific comparisons between the different species in different categories of intelligence. These comparisons ___30___ that dogs are intelligent, but their intelligence is not as ___31___ as some researchers might have believed.
　　　In many areas, though, comparisons were not possible. For example, the researchers noted that both dogs and cats are known to be able to recognize and ___32___ human voices. But the investigators could not find any data to indicate which species can remember a greater number of___33___ human voices,  so it was impossible to  compare the two on that front. However, not all researchers agree ___34___ with the findings of this study. Zachary Silver, an American researcher, believes the authors of the new study ___35___ the idea that an excessive amount of research has been devoted to dogs, as the field of dog cognition is young, and there is much to be learned about how dogs think.

Section B
　Directions: In  this section, you  are going  to  read a passage with  ten statements  attached to  it. Each statement contains  information given  in  one of  the paragraphs. Identify  the paragraph from  which  the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by making the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
The lifesaving power of gratitude
A) Gratitude may be more beneficial than we commonly suppose. One recent study asked participants to write a note of thanks to  someone  and then  estimate how  surprised  and happy the recipient would feel—an impact that they consistently underestimated. Another study assessed the health benefits of writing thank-you notes. The researchers found that writing as few as three weekly thank-you notes over the course of three weeks improved life satisfaction, increased happy feelings and reduced symptoms of depression.
B) While this research into gratitude is relatively new, the principles involved are anything but. Students of mine in a political philosophy course at Indiana University are reading Daniel Defoe's 300-year-old Robinson Crusoe, often regarded as the first novel published in English. Left alone on an unknown island with no apparent prospect of rescue or escape, Crusoe has much to lament (悲叹). But instead of giving in to despair, he makes a list of things for which he is grateful, including the fact that he is the sole survivor from the shipwreck (海难) and has been able to salvage many useful items from the wreckage.
C) Defoe's masterpiece, which is often ranked as one of the world's greatest novels, provides a portrait of gratitude in action that is as timely and relevant today as it has ever been. It is also one with which contemporary psychology and medicine are just beginning to catch up. Simply put, for most of us, it is far more helpful to focus on the things in life for which we can express gratitude than those that incline us toward resentment and lamentation.
D) When we focus on the things we regret, such as failed relationships, family disputes, and setbacks in career and finance, we tend to become more regretful. Conversely, when we focus on the things we are grateful for, a greater sense of happiness tends to spread through our lives. And while no one would argue for cultivating a false sense of blessedness, there is mounting evidence that counting our blessings is one of the best habits we can develop to promote mental and physical health.
E) Gratitude has long enjoyed a privileged position in many of the world's cultural traditions. For example, some ancient Western philosophers counsel gratitude that is both enduring and complete, and  some Eastern thinkers portray it as not merely an attitude but a virtue to be put into practice.
F) Recent scientific studies support these ancient teachings. Individuals who regularly engage in gratitude exercises, such as counting their blessings or expressing gratitude to others, exhibit increased satisfaction with relationships and fewer symptoms of physical illness. And the benefits are not only psychological and  physical.  They  may   also  be  moral—those  who  practice   gratitude  also  view  their  lives   less materialistically and suffer from less envy.
G) There are multiple explanations for such benefits of gratefulness. One is the fact that expressing gratitude encourages  others  to  continue  being   generous,  thus  promoting   a  virtuous  cycle  of  goodness   in relationships. Similarly, grateful people may be more likely to reciprocate (回报) with acts of kindness of their own. Broadly speaking, a community in which people feel grateful to one another is likely to be a more pleasant place to live than one characterized by mutual suspicion and resentment. The beneficial effects of gratitude may extend even further. For example, when many people feel good about what someone  else has  done  for  them, they  experience  a  sense  of being  lifted  up, with  a  corresponding enhancement  of their  regard  for  humanity.  Some  are  inspired  to  attempt  to  become  better  people themselves, doing more to help bring out the best in others and bringing more goodness into the world around them.
H) Gratitude also tends to strengthen a sense of connection with others. When people want to do good things that inspire gratitude, the level of dedication in relationships tends to grow and relationships seem to last longer. And when people feel more connected, they are more likely to choose to spend their time with one another and demonstrate their feelings of affection in daily acts.
I) Of course, acts of kindness can also foster discomfort. For example, if people feel they are not worthy of kindness or suspect that some ulterior (别有用心的) motive lies behind it, the benefits of gratitude will not  be  realized.  Likewise,  receiving  a  kindness  can  give  rise  to  a  sense  of  indebtedness,  leaving beneficiaries feeling that they must now pay back whatever good they have received. Gratitude can flourish only if people are secure enough in themselves and sufficiently trusting to allow it to do so. Another obstacle to gratitude is often called a sense of entitlement. Instead of experiencing a benefaction (善行) as a good turn, people sometimes regard it as a mere payment of what they are owed, for which no one deserves any moral credit.
J) There are a number of practical steps anyone can take to promote a sense of gratitude. One is simply spending time on a regular basis thinking about someone who has made a difference, or perhaps writing a thank-you note or expressing such gratitude in person. Others are found in ancient religious disciplines, such as reflecting on benefactions received from another person or actually praying for the health and happiness  of  a  benefactor.   In  addition  to  benefactions  received,   it  is   also  possible  to   focus  on opportunities to do good oneself, whether those acted on in the past or hoped for in the future. Some people are most grateful not for what others have done for them but for chances they enjoyed to help others. In regularly reflecting on the things in his life he is grateful for, Defoe's Crusoe believes that he becomes a far better person than he would have been had he remained in the society from which he originally set out on his voyage.
K)  Reflecting  on  generosity  and  gratitude,  the  great  basketball  coach  John  Wooden  once  offered  two counsels to his players and students. First, he said, "It is impossible to have a perfect day unless you have done something for someone who will never be able to repay you." In saying this, Wooden sought to promote purely generous acts, as opposed to those performed with an expectation of reward. Second, he said, "Give thanks for your blessings every day.”
L) Some faith traditions incorporate such practices into the rhythm of daily life. For example, adherents of some religions offer prayers of thanksgiving every morning before rising and every night before lying down to sleep. Others offer thanks throughout the day, such as before meals. Other less frequent special events, such as births, deaths and marriages, may also be heralded by such prayers.
M) When Defoe depicted Robinson Crusoe making thanksgiving a daily part of his island life, he was anticipating findings in social science and medicine that would not appear for hundreds of years. Yet he was also reflecting the wisdom of religious and philosophical traditions that extend back thousands of years. Gratitude is one of the healthiest and most nourishing of all states of mind, and those who adopt it as a habit are enriching not only their own lives but also the lives of those around them.

36. It does us far more good to focus on things we can be grateful for than what makes us sad and resentful.
37. The beneficial impacts of gratitude can extend from individuals to their community and to the wider society.
38. The participants in a recent study repeatedly underestimated the positive effect on those who received thank-you notes.
39. Good deeds can sometimes make people feel uncomfortable.
40. People who regularly express gratitude can benefit in moral terms.
41. A basketball coach advocated performing generous acts without expecting anything in return.
42. More and more evidence shows it makes us mentally and physically healthier to routinely count our blessings.
43. Of all states of mind, feeling grateful is considered one of the most healthy and beneficial. 44. The principles underlying the research into gratitude are nothing new at all.
45. Gratitude is likely to enhance one's sense of being connected with other people.

Section C
　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Technology is never a neutral tool for achieving human ends. Technological innovations reshape people as they use these innovations to control their environment. Artificial intelligence, for example, is altering humanity.
　　　While   the   term   AI   conjures   up   anxieties   about   killer   robots   or   catastrophic   levels   of unemployment, there are other, deeper implications. As AI increasingly shapes the human experience, how does this change what it means to be human? Central to the problem is a person's capacity to make choices, particularly judgments that have moral implications.
　　　Aristotle argued that the capacity for making practical judgments depends on regularly making them—on habit and practice. We see the emergence of machines as substitute judges in  a variety of everyday  contexts  as  a  potential  threat  to  people  learning  how  to  effectively  exercise  judgment themselves.
　　　In the workplace, managers routinely make decisions about who to hire or fire and which loan to approve, to name a few. These are areas where algorithmic (算法的) prescription is replacing human judgment, and so people who might have had the chance to develop practical judgment in these areas no longer will.
　　　Recommendation engines, which are increasingly prevalent intermediaries in people's consumption of  culture,   may  serve  to  constrain  choice  and  minimize  luck.  By  presenting  consumers  with algorithmically selected choices of what to watch, read, stream and visit next, companies are replacing human taste with machine taste. In one sense, this is helpful. After all, machines can survey a wider range of choices than any individual is likely to have the time or energy to do on their own.
　　　At the same time, though, this selection is optimizing for what people are likely to prefer based on what they've preferred in the past. We think there is some risk that people's options will be constrained by their past in a new and unanticipated way.
　　　As machine learning algorithms improve and as they train on more extensive data sets, larger parts of everyday life are likely to become utterly predictable. The predictions are going to get better and better, and they will ultimately make common experiences more efficient and pleasant.
Algorithms could soon-if they don't already—have a better idea about which show you'd like to watch next and which job candidate you should hire than you do. One day, humans may even find a way for machines to make these decisions without some of the biases that humans typically display.
　　　But to the extent that unpredictability is part of how people understand themselves and part of what people  like  about  themselves, humanity  is  in  the process  of losing  something  significant.  As  they become more and more predictable, the creatures inhabiting the increasingly AI-mediated world will become less and less like us.
46. What do we learn about the deeper implications of AI?
A) It is causing catastrophic levels of unemployment.
B) It is doing physical harm to human operators.
C) It is altering moral judgments.
D) It is reshaping humanity.
47. What is the consequence of algorithmic prescription replacing human judgment?
A) People lose the chance to cultivate the ability to make practical judgments.
B) People are prevented from participating in making major decisions in the workplace. C) Managers no longer have the chance to decide which loan to approve.
D) Managers do not need to take the trouble to determine who to hire or fire.
48. What may result from increasing application of recommendation engines in our consumption of culture?
A) Consumers will have much limited choice.    C) It will be easier to decide on what to enjoy.
B) Consumers will actually enjoy better luck.     D) Humans will develop tastes similar to machines'.
49. What is likely to happen to larger parts of our daily life as machine learning algorithms improve? A) They will turn out to be more pleasant.           C) They can be completely anticipated.
B) They will repeat our past experience.              D) They may become better and better.
50. Why does the author say the creatures living in the more and more Al-mediated world will become increasingly unlike us?
A) They will have lost the most significant human element of being intelligent.
B) They will no longer possess the human characteristic of being unpredictable.
C) They will not be able to understand themselves as we can do today.
D) They will be deprived of what their predecessors were proud of about themselves.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Phonics, which involves sounding out words syllable（音节) by  syllable, is the best way to teach children to read. But in many classrooms, this can be a dirty word. So much so that some teachers have had to sneak phonics teaching materials into the classroom. Most American children are taught to read in a way that study after study has found to be wrong.
The consequences of this are striking. Less than half of all American adults were proficient readers in
2017. American fourth graders rank 15th on the Progress in International Literacy Study, an international
exam.
　　　America is stuck in a debate about teaching children to read that has been going on for decades. Some advocate teaching symbol-sound relationships (the sound k can be spelled as c, k, ck, or ch), known as phonics. Others support an immersive approach (using pictures of a cat to learn the word cat),known as "whole language". Most teachers today, almost three out of four according to a survey by the Ed Week Research Centre in 2019, use a mix called "balanced literacy". This combination of methods is ineffective. "You can't sprinkle in a little phonics," says Tenette Smith, executive director of elementary education and reading at Mississippi's education department. "It has to be systematic and explicitly taught."
Mississippi, often behind in social policy, has set an example here. In a state once notorious for its low reading scores, the Mississippi state legislature passed new literacy standards in 2013. Since then Mississippi has seen remarkable gains. Its fourth graders have moved from 49th (out of 50 states) to 29th on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a nationwide exam. In 2019 it was the only state to improve its scores. For the first time since measurement began, Mississippi's pupils are now average readers, a remarkable achievement in such a poor state.
　　　Mississippi's success is attributed to implementing reading methods supported by a body of research known as the science of reading. In  1997 Congress requested the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Department of Education to convene a National Reading Panel to end the "reading wars" and synthesize the evidence. The panel found that phonics, along with explicit instruction in phonemic (音位的)awareness, fluency and comprehension, worked best.
　　　Yet  over two  decades  on,  "balanced  literacy"  is  still  being  taught  in  classrooms.  But  advances  in statistics and brain imaging have disproved the whole-language method. To the teacher who is a proficient reader,  literacy  seems  like  a  natural  process  that requires  educated  guessing,  rather  than the  deliberate process emphasized by phonics. Teachers can imagine that they learned to read through osmosis (潜移默化)
when they were children. Without proper training, they bring this to classrooms.
51. What do we learn about phonics in many American classrooms?
A) It is ill reputed.                                                     C) It is arbitrarily excluded.
B) It is mostly misapplied.                                       D) It is misrepresented.
52. What has America been witnessing for decades?
A) An obsession with innovating teaching methodologies of reading.
B) An enduring debate over the approach to teaching children to read.
C) An increasing concern with many children's inadequacy in literacy.
D) An ever-forceful advocacy of a combined method for teaching reading.
53. Why does Tenette Smith think a combination of teaching methods is ineffective?
A) Elementary schoolchildren will be frustrated when taught with several methods combined. B) Phonics has to be systematically applied and clearly taught to achieve the desired effect.
　C) Sprinkling in a little phonics deters the progress of even adequately motivated children. D) Balanced literacy fails to sustain children's interest in developing a good reading habit.
54. What does the author say Mississippi's success is attributed to?
A) Convening a National Reading Panel to synthesize research evidence.
B) Placing sufficient emphasis upon both fluency and comprehension.
C) Adopting scientifically grounded approaches to teaching reading.
D) Obtaining support from Congress to upgrade teaching methods.
55. What have advances in statistics and brain imaging proved ineffective?
A) The teaching of symbol-sound relationships.     C) Efforts to end the reading wars.
B) Explicit instruction in phonemic awareness.       D) The immersive approach.

Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.  You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
　　　Imagine sitting down to a big dinner: a massive steak, a large portion of fried potatoes, and cake for dessert. After eating so much, you should be too full to eat another bite. But some people experience a powerful urge to keep eating, even after ___26___ in a huge meal, a behavior that makes little sense, as most adults are well-versed in the dangers of obesity, which researchers have shown correlates with ___27___ health issues and is even linked to increased ___28___ risk. But some people still keep eating long after they should stop, a phenomenon Dr.  Susan Thompson calls  " insatiable ( 永 不 满 足 的 ) hunger." It is characterized by two main ___29___: not being satisfied by eating, and having a desire to stay sedentary (久坐不动的).
　　　This is at ___30___ with how humans are biologically programmed. When there was a great deal of food available, ancient people would gorge on calories; this massive calorie intake was accompanied by an urge to get active. Humans were also programmed for something called "compensation," which is the brain's ___31___ mechanism for preventing the accumulation of excess weight. With compensation, if you eat one large meal in the morning, you are naturally ___32___ to eat less for the rest of the day.
　　　But recent studies show that 70% of American adults have lost the ability to naturally compensate for the calories they consume; worse ___33___, a significant number of them report ___34___ hunger halfway through an eating session, but, by the end of the meal, they feel the same or higher levels of hunger than when they sat down. Dr. Thompson argues that the main cause of this phenomenon is the modern diet, which is ___35___ of food high in sugar, carbohydrates and calories.

Section B
　Directions: In  this section, you  are going  to  read a passage with  ten statements  attached to  it. Each statement contains  information given  in  one of  the paragraphs. Identify  the paragraph from  which  the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by making the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
The problem with being perfect
A) When psychologist Jessica Pryor lived near an internationally renowned university,  she  once  saw  a student walking into a library holding a sleeping bag and a coffee maker. She has heard of graduate students spending 12 to 18 hours at a time in the lab. Their schedules are meant to be literally punishing: If they are scientists-in-training, they won't allow themselves to watch Netflix until their experiments start generating results. "Relationships become estranged ( 疏远 的)-people stop inviting them to social gatherings or dinner parties, which leads them to spend even more time in the lab," Pryor told me.
B) Along with other therapists, Pryor, who is now with the Family Institute at Northwestern University, is trying to  sound  the  alarm  about  a  tendency  among  young  adults  and  college  students  to  strive  for perfection in their work—sometimes at any cost. Though it is often portrayed as a positive trait, Pryor and others say extreme perfectionism can lead to depression, anxiety, and even suicide.
C) What's more, perfectionism seems to be on the rise. In a study of thousands of American, Canadian, and British college students published earlier this year, Thomas Curran of the University of Bath and Andrew Hill of York St. John University found that today's college students report higher levels of perfectionism than college students did during the 1990s or early 2000s. They measured three types of perfectionism: self-oriented, or a desire to be perfect; socially prescribed, or a desire to live up to others' expectations; and  other-oriented,  or  holding  others  to  unrealistic  standards.  From   1989  to  2016,  they  found, self-oriented perfectionism scores increased by 10 percent, socially prescribed scores rose by 33 percent, and other-oriented perfectionism increased by 16 percent.
D) A person living with an other-oriented perfectionist might feel criticized by the perfectionist spouse for not doing household chores exactly the "right" way. "One of the most common things couples  argue about is the proper way of loading the dishwasher," says Amy Bach, a psychologist in Providence, Rhode Island.
E) Curran describes socially prescribed perfectionism as "My self-esteem is contingent on what other people think." His study didn't examine the causal reasons for its rise, but he assumes that the rise of both standardized testing and social media might play a role. These days, LinkedIn alerts us when our rival gets a new job, and Instagram can let us know how well "liked" our lives are compared with a friend's. In an opinion piece earlier this year, Curran and Hill argue that society has also become more dog-eat-dog. "Over the last 50 years, public interest and civic responsibility have been progressively eroded," they write, "replaced by a focus on self-interest and competition in a supposedly free and open marketplace." We strive for perfection,it seems, because we feel we must in order to get ahead. Michael Brustein, a clinical psychologist in Manhattan, says when he first began practicing in 2007, he was surprised by how prevalent perfectionism was among his clients, despite how little his graduate training had focused on the
phenomenon. He sees perfectionism in, among others, clients who are entrepreneurs, artists, and tech employees. "You're in New York because you're ambitious, you have this need to strive," he says. "But then your whole identity gets wrapped into a goal."
F) Perfectionism can, of course, be a positive force. Think of professional athletes, who train aggressively for ever-higher levels of competition. In well-adjusted perfectionism, someone who doesn't get the gold is able to forget the setback and move on. In maladaptive (不当的) perfectionism, meanwhile, people make an archive of all their failures. They revisit these archives constantly, thinking, as Pryor puts it, "I need to make myself feel terrible so I don't do this again." Then they double down, "raising the expectation bar even higher, which increases the likelihood of defeat, which makes you self-critical, so you raise the bar higher, work even harder," she says. Next comes failure, shame, and pushing yourself even harder toward even higher  and more  impossible  goals. Meeting them becomes  an  "all  or  nothing" premise.  Pryor offered this example: "Even if I'm an incredible attorney, if I don't make partner in the same pacing as one of my colleagues, clearly that means I'm a failure."
G) Brustein says his perfectionist clients tend to devalue their accomplishments, so that every time a goal is achieved,the high lasts only a short time, like "a gas tank with a hole in it." If the boss says you did a great job, it's because he doesn't know anything. If the audience likes your work, that's because it's too stupid to know what good art actually is. But, therapists say, there are also different ways perfectionism manifests. Some perfectionists are always pushing themselves forward. But others actually fall behind on work, unable to  complete  assignments  unless  they  are,  well,  perfect.  Or  they  might  handicap  their performance ahead of time. They're the ones partying until 2 a. m. the night before the final, so that when the grade C rolls in, there's a ready excuse.
H) While educators and parents have successfully convinced students of the need to be high performing and diligent, the  experts told me, they haven't  adequately prepared them  for the  inevitability  of failure. Instead of praises like "You're so smart," parents and educators should say things like "You really stuck with it," Pryor says, to emphasize the value of perseverance over intrinsic talent. Pryor notes that many of her clients are wary she'll "turn them into some degenerate couch potato and teach them to be okay with it." Instead, she tries to help them think through the parts of their perfectionism they'd like to keep, and to lose the parts that are ruining their lives.
I) Bach, who sees many students from Brown University, says some of them don't even go out on weekends, let alone weekdays. She tells them, "Aim high,but get comfortable with good enough." When they don't get  some  award,  she  encourages  them  to  remember  that  "one  outcome  is  not  a  basis  for  a  broad conclusion about the person's intelligence, qualifications, or potential for the future."
J) The treatment for perfectionism might be as simple as having patients keep logs of things they can be proud of, or having them behave imperfectly in small ways, just to see how it feels. "We might have them hang the towels crooked ( 不 正 的) or wear some clothing inside out," says Martin Antony, a professor in the department of psychology at Ryerson University in Toronto.
K) Brustein likes to get his perfectionist clients to create values that are important to them, then try to shift their focus to living according to those values rather than achieving specific goals. It's a play on the "You really stuck with it" message for kids. In other words, it isn't about doing a headstand in yoga class; it's about going to yoga class in the first place, because you like to be the kind of person who takes care of herself. But he warns that some people go into therapy expecting too much-an instant transformation of themselves from a pathological (病态的) perfectionist to a (still high-achieving) non-perfectionist. They try to be perfect, in other words, at no longer being perfect.
36. Socially prescribed perfectionism is described as one's self-esteem depending on other people's opinion.
37. Jessica Pryor has learned that some graduate students work such long hours in the lab that they have little time for entertainment or socializing.
38. The author believes perfectionism may sometimes be constructive.

Section C
　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　How on earth did we come to this? We protect our children obsessively from every harm; we scrutinize every carer, teacher or doctor with whom they come into contact. Yet despite all this, one group, which in no way has their best interests at heart, has almost unconstrained access.
　　　We seem to take it for granted that advertisers and marketers are allowed to condition even the youngest children. Before children have even developed a proper sense of their own identity, or learned to handle money, they're encouraged to associate status and self-worth with stuff, and to look to external things such as fame and wealth for validation. We're turning out little consumers rather than young citizens who will value themselves for what they contribute to the society in which they live.
　　　We've reached this point so gradually that many of us have never questioned it. It's crept up on us in the 60years since advertisers started to target the young and found that they could recruit them to a commercial assault on their parents. We've come to know it as "pester power" or the ability of children to pressure parents to make certain purchases.
　　　Many psychologists, child development experts and educators point to research suggesting that this emerging cradle-to-grave consumerism is contributing to growing rates of low self-esteem, depression and other forms of mental illness.
　　　Not all psychologists agree. There're plenty working handing love with a ￡12bn-a-year industry that has turned the manipulation of adult emotions and desires into an art form-often literally. It's also one that's forever developing new ways to persuade our children to desire material possessions, and because of advertisements' viral effect they only need to infect a few to reach the many. Advertising and marketing can serve a useful purpose for children. Marketing may help socialize children as consumers, inform them about products, and help them carve out unique identities as they reach adulthood.
Then, should we ban all advertising aimed at young children? I say yes.
　　　Of course there'll be plenty of objections to an outright ban on advertising to the under-11s. There'll be those who argue that would be a breach of freedom of speech and infringe the rights of corporations to brainwash little children into demanding their products.
　　　Most parents hate what advertising does to their children, but we do have the power to end it and let our children grow up free from many of the pressures of consumerism until they're old enough to make their own decisions. And though advertising is only part of an all-pervasive ( 无 处 不 在 的 ) marketing culture we need to make a start somewhere. Let's ban all advertising targeting children of primary school age and younger now.
46. Which group of people does the author say has almost unrestricted access to children?   A) Advertisers.                    B) Carers.                    C) Teachers.                     D) Doctors.

47. What kind of people should we enable children to become according to the author? A) Those who look to fame and wealth for external and ultimate validation.
B) Those who value themselves because of their contribution to society.
C) Those who associate self-worth with the ability to handle money.
D) Those who have developed a proper sense of their own identity.
48. Many child development experts and educators call attention to research that suggests              . A) life-long consumerism is causing more and more cases of psychological problems.
B) increasing commercialization of education is eroding many children's self-esteem. C) the growing desire for wealth is contributing to a rising rate of depression.
D) the craving for purchasing material things is nurtured throughout one's life.
49. What does the author imply about the impact of advertising?
A) It is actually infectious to many rather than a few.
B) It is rooted in our desire for material possessions.
C) It is comparable to that of virus.
D) It is literally limited to children.
50. What is the opponents' argument against a complete ban on advertising to young children? A) It would deprive them of the chance to learn about products.
B) It would render them unable to carve out unique identities.
C) It would breach their freedom as would-be consumers.
D) It would violate the rights endowed upon advertisers.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Many  oppose  workplace  surveillance,  because  of the  inherent  dehumanizing  effect  it  has  and  the relentless pressure it brings. But it's on the rise around the world as firms look to become more efficient by squeezing more productivity from their workers. More than half of companies with over $750m in annual revenue used "non-traditional” monitoring techniques on staff last year.
　　　Monitoring employee performance gives firms the ability to assess how their staff are performing and interacting, which can be good for both the firm and employees themselves. A growing number of analytics companies offer this service. They gather "data exhaust" left by employees' email and instant messaging apps, and use name badges equipped with radio-frequency identification devices and microphones. These can check how much time you spend talking, your volume and tone of voice, even if you do not dominate conversations. While this may sound intrusive, exponents argue that it can also protect employees against bullying and sexual harassment.
　　　Some of this data analysis can produce unexpected results. For example, it was found that people who sat at 12-person lunch tables tended to interact, share ideas more and outperform those who regularly sat at four-person tables, a fact that would probably have gone undetected without such data analysis.
　　　Over the last few years a Stockholm co-working space called Epicenter has gone much further and holds popular "chipping parties", where people can have microchips implanted in their hands. They can use the implants to access electronically-controlled doors, or monitor how typing speed correlates with heart rate. Implanted chips may seem extreme, but it is a relatively small step from ID cards and biometrics to such devices.
　　　As   long    as   such    schemes   are    voluntary,   there    will   probably   be    a    growing   number    of convenience-oriented uses so that a substantial number of workers would opt to have a chip inserted. But if implanted chips are used to reduce slack time or rest breaks, that could prove to be detrimental. And if surveillance tools take away autonomy, that's when they prove most unpopular. A lot depends on how such monitoring initiatives are communicated and this could prevent possible revolts being staged.
2023 年 6 月英语六级真题第 2 套  第 7 页，共 8 页

　　　If bosses don't communicate effectively, employees assume the worst. But if they're  open about the information they're  collecting  and  what they're  doing  with  it, research  suggests  46%  of employees  are generally okay with it. Although many such monitoring schemes use anonymised data and participation is voluntary, many staffers remain sceptical and fear an erosion of their civil liberties.
　　　So workplace surveillance could be empowering for staff and useful for companies looking to become more efficient and profitable. But implemented in the wrong way, it could also become an unpopular tool of oppression that proves counterproductive.
51. Why are many people opposed to monitoring employee performance?
A) It puts workers under constant pressure.
B) It is universally deemed anti-human by nature.
C) It does both mental and physical harm to employees monitored.
D) It enables firms to squeeze maximal productivity from employees.
52. What is the supporters' argument for workplace surveillance?
A) It enables employees to refrain from dominating conversations.
B) It enhances employees' identification with firms they work in.
C) It can alert employees to intrusion into their privacy.
D) It can protect employees against aggressive behavior.
53. What does the author want to show by the example of different numbers of people interacting at lunch tables?
A) Data analysis is key to the successful implementation of workplace surveillance.
B) Analyzing data gathered from workers can yield something unexpected.
C) More workmates sitting at a lunch table tend to facilitate interaction and idea sharing.
　　D) It is hard to decide on how many people to sit at a lunch table without data analysis. 54. What does much of the positive effect of monitoring initiatives depend on?
A) How frequently employees are to be monitored.
B) What specific personal information is being excluded.
C) What steps are taken to minimize their detrimental impact.
D) How well bosses make known their purpose of monitoring.
55. What concern do monitoring initiatives cause among many staffers?
A) They may empower employers excessively.
B) They may erode the workplace environment.
C) They may infringe upon staffers' entitled freedom.
D) They may become counterproductive in the long run.

　　　You might not know yourself as well as you think. According to a new study, people are ___26___ accurate judges of only some of their behaviors. While most previous studies on how well people know themselves have been done on long-term personality traits, this new study ___27___ how well people understand how they are acting from one moment to the next. Researchers asked participants to wear audio recorders that automatically ___28___ every 9.5 minutes between 7 a.m. and 2 a.m. to record 30 seconds  of audio.  These  participants  were  then  emailed  surveys  four  times  a  day  asking  them  to ___29___ how outgoing, agreeable, or conscientious they were during a particular hour of the day. The study used data from 248 participants, all of whom answered questions about their behavior for two ___30___ weeks and wore the audio device for one of those weeks.
　　　Six laboratory assistants rated each participant's audio clips to see how their observations compared with people's ___31___ of themselves. The six assistants were generally in agreement with one another about how the people they were observing acted. Further, participants' ratings of their own behaviors agreed with observers' for how outgoing and how conscientious they were being. But the agreement between participants and outside observers was much smaller for agreeableness. Some of this ___32___ could be because the observers used only audio clips, and thus could not read ___33___ like body language, but there are ___34___ other explanations, as people should be able to hear when a participant is being kind versus being rude. The weak agreement between how participants thought they were acting and what observers heard could be because people would rather____35___ rude behavior.

Why we need tiny colleges
A) We're experiencing the rebirth of smallness. Farmers markets, tiny homes, and brew pubs all exemplify our love of smallness. So do charter schools, coffee shops, and local bookstores. Small is often (but not always) more affordable, healthier, and sustainable, but its finest characteristic, the one that turns charm into love, is that going small allows us to be more fully who we are.
B)  In  higher  education  the  trend  is  mostly  in  the  opposite  direction:  Universities  with  20,000  or 30,000 students are considered "mid-sized". The nation's largest university, Arizona State University, has 80,000 students on campus and aims to enroll another 100,000 students online. At the other end of the spectrum is a handful of colleges that have fewer than a hundred students on campus and no online courses: colleges such as Sterling College, Thomas More College of Liberal Arts, and Deep Springs College. These colleges are so small that they can only be called "tiny."
C) Tiny colleges focus not just on a young person's intellect, but on the young person as a whole. Equally important, tiny colleges ask, "How can education contribute to human flourishing and the well-being of the world?" And they shape a college experience to address that question. They replace concerns about institutional growth with attention to the growth of students as fully developed participants in their communities.
D) I've had the privilege of teaching at three different institutions of higher learning during my career-a small liberal arts college and two mid-sized public universities. I've also been profoundly disappointed in each of these institutions, and in many of my colleagues, especially when it comes to helping students and preparing them  for the many responsibilities  of adulthood. Administrators  focus  on  the business  of running a university, and most faculty focus on their scholarship and teaching their discipline. Little deliberate attention is given to how students mature as individuals and social beings.
E) Having just retired from teaching at a public university, I'm now returning to my hometown of Flagstaff, Arizona, to establish a tiny college—Flagstaff College. I'm convinced there's a need for another type of education, one devoted to helping students come into their own and into this beautiful and troubled world.  Young  people  need  an  education  that  will  provide  them  with  meaning,  hope,  courage,  and passion, as well as information and skills. Large institutions, I believe, are particularly ill-suited to this type of education.
F) There's no "best of" list when it comes to tiny colleges, at least not yet. But around the country people are creating new colleges that provide an alternative to small liberal arts colleges, large public universities, and online education.
G) With only 26 students, Deep Springs is the smallest college in the country and, quite likely, the most atypical (非典型的). Located on a working cattle ranch on the California-Nevada border, Deep Springs
2023 年 6 月英语六级真题第 3 套  第 2 页，共 6 页

　is a private, residential, two-year college for men, committed to educating students for "a life of service to humanity." Founded by the electricity tycoon ( 大亨) L.L. Nunn in 1917, Deep Springs "curriculum" revolves around academics, labor, and self-governance. In addition to their courses, students are charged with running the 155-acre ranch and overseeing the functioning of the college. Students chair both the admissions and the curriculum committees.
H) "Living in close community with one's teachers and fellow students, and being forced to take on adult responsibilities, makes for one's growth as a person," says William Hunt, who graduated last year. "To exist  for very  long  in  a  community  like that, you have to  get  over the  question  of whether you're sufficiently talented or principled and get started worrying about how you can stretch yourself and your peers, how much you can manage to learn with them."
I) Sterling College, in Craftsbury Common, Vermont, is also very small-fewer than  100 students. Unlike Deep Springs, Sterling focuses its curriculum on environmental and social justice issues, but like Deep Springs it places a high value on personal responsibility and manual labor. According to its catalog, a college education at Sterling combines "rigorous academics, roll-up-your-sleeves challenges, and good old hard work."
J) The average tuition at a small liberal-arts college is $30,000 to $40,000 a year, not including the cost of living on campus, as compared to $8,000 to $10,000 a year for tuition alone at a public university. Of the tiny colleges, only Deep Springs doesn't charge tuition or room and board; students pay only for books and the cost of traveling to and from college. If tiny schools are to become a player on the higher education scene, they will need to find a way to be truly affordable.
K) Doing so may not be that difficult so long as they do not pattern themselves too closely on existing norms. We've come to believe that a good college should have many academic programs and excellent facilities, posh (豪华的) dorms, an array of athletic programs, and a world-class student activity center. Imagine a good college without a climbing wall! We also have accepted the idea that college presidents, and their many vice-presidents, should be paid like their counterparts in the business world and that higher education requires an elaborate, up-to-date technology infrastructure. All of this drives up the cost of education.
L) The "trick" to making tiny colleges affordable, if that's the right word, is simplicity. At its core, education is  a  human-to-human  interaction.  Reflecting  on  his  own  college  education,  President  Garfield  once commented that an ideal college would consist of nothing more than the legendary teacher Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on the other. The economics of a tiny college, in other words, might be similar to that of a tiny house. Because it is small, a tiny house costs less to build and less to furnish, insure, and maintain. But the economic benefits of a small house don't end there. Tiny homes discourage homeowners from buying stuff that they really don't need, because there's no place to put it.
M) I'm a late convert to the idea of tiny colleges, and I fully understand the need for many diverse types of educational institutions. Academic research and job training are important, but tiny colleges aren't suited for either. The educational needs of a complex society are themselves complex, and no single model can meet all of these needs. But I'm now convinced there's an educational need that's now going almost completely unmet: namely, the need to help young people transition into adulthood. Tiny colleges can do this better than any other type of educational institution.
N) The ultimate justification for a tiny college is the conviction that each of us comes into our full humanity by close interaction with those who know and care for us, and that one of the basic purposes of higher education is social. Although we give lip service to the idea that a college education will make us better people, when all's said and done, we think of higher education primarily in economic terms. We've come to think of higher education as a means to make a living rather than make a life. We've also come to see higher education as a private good rather than a public one. Tiny colleges are not the answer to all of our educational requirements, but they're an answer to one of our most basic educational necessities; the need

Section C
　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　If you're someone who has turned to snacking on junk food more in the pandemic ( 大流行病), you're not alone. Investigative reporter Michael Moss says processed food is engineered to hook you, not unlike alcohol, cigarettes, or other harmful substances. His 2013 book, Salt Sugar Fat, explored food companies' aggressive marketing of those products and their impact on our health. In his new book, Hooked, Moss updates the food giants' efforts to keep us eating what they  serve, and how they're responding to complaints from consumers and health advocates.
　　　Processed food is inexpensive, it's legal, and it's everywhere. Companies' advertising is cueing us to remember those products and we want those products constantly. So the food environment is one of those key things that makes food even more problematic for so many people. Memory, nostalgia (怀旧) in particular, plays a big role in the foods we crave. Soda companies discovered that if they put a soda in the hands of a child when they're at a ball game with their parents, that soda will forever be associated with that joyous moment. Later in life, when that child wants to experience a joyous moment, they're going to think of soda. Many people seek comfort in the snacks they remember from childhood.
　　　Moss examines the way companies capitalize on our memories, cravings and brain chemistry to keep us snacking.
　　　One of the reasons I came to think that some of these food products are even more powerful, more troublesome than drugs can be is memory. What we eat is all about memory. And we begin forming memories for food at a really early age. And we keep those memories for a lifetime. Knowing this, the food industry spends lots of time trying to shape the memories that we have for their products. One of the features of addiction that scientists studying drug addiction discovered back in the 1990s was that the faster a substance hits the brain, the more apt we are as a result to act impulsively. There's nothing faster than food in its ability to hit the brain. For Moss, this puts the notion of "fast food" in an entirely new light as this isn't limited to fast food chains-almost 90% of food products in grocery stores are processed foods. Everything in the industry is about speed, from manufacturing to packaging.
Overall, Moss outlines the industry's dependence on making their products inexpensive,  super 2023 年 6 月英语六级真题第 3 套  第 4 页，共 6 页

　delicious, and incredibly convenient for consumers. Now that more and more people care about what they put in their bodies and are wanting to eat healthier, these companies are finding it really difficult to meet that new demand because of their own addiction to making these convenience foods.
46. In what way does Michael Moss think processed food is comparable to alcohol and cigarettes? A) They are all addictive.                                      C) They are all engineered to be enjoyed.
B) They are all necessary evils.                            D) They are all in increasingly great demand.
47. What does the author say plays a key role in the foods we crave?
A) The food environment.                                    C) Convenience.
B) Aggressive marketing.                                    D) Memory.
48. What do food companies do to capitalize on consumers' association with their food products? A) They strive to influence how consumers remember their products.
B) They attempt to use consumers' long-term memories to promote addiction.
　C) They try to exploit consumers' memories for their products as early as possible. D) They endeavor to find what consumers remember about their products.
49. How does the food industry operate from manufacturing to packaging, according to Moss? A) Placing the idea of fast food in an entirely new light.
B) Setting no limit to the number of fast food chains.
C) Focusing on how quickly the work is done.
D) Prioritizing the quality of their products.
50. Why are companies finding it difficult to satisfy consumers' demand for healthier food products? A) They think speed of production outweighs consumers' health.
B) They believe their industry would perish without fast foods.
C) They have to strike a balance between taste and nutrition.
D) They are hooked on manufacturing convenience foods.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Chimpanzees ( 黑猩猩), human beings' closest animal relatives, share up to 98% of our genes. Yet humans and chimpanzees lead very different lives. Fewer than 300,000 wild chimpanzees live in a few forested corners of Africa today, while humans have colonized every corner of the globe. At more than 7 billion, human population dwarfs that of nearly all other mammals—despite our physical weaknesses.
What could account for our species' incredible evolutionary successes?
　　　One obvious answer is our big brains. It could be that our raw intelligence gave us an unprecedented ability to think outside the box, innovating solutions to thorny problems as people migrated across the globe.
　　　But  a  growing  number  of cognitive  scientists  and  anthropologists  ( 人 类 学 家 )  are  rejecting  that explanation. They think that, rather than making our living as innovators, we survive and thrive precisely because we don't think for ourselves. Instead, people cope with challenging climates and ecological contexts by carefully copying others.
　　　In  a  famous  study, psychologists  Victoria Horner  and Andrew Whiten  showed two  groups  of test subjects-children and chimpanzees-a mechanical box with a treat inside. In one condition, the box was opaque, while in the other it was transparent. The experimenters demonstrated how to open the box to retrieve the treat, but they also included the irrelevant step of tapping on the box with a stick.
　　　Oddly, the children carefully copied all the steps to open the box, even when they could see that the stick had no practical effect. That is, they copied irrationally: Instead of doing only what was necessary to get their reward, children slavishly imitated every action they'd witnessed.
　　　Of course, that study only included three- and four-year-olds. But additional research has shown that older children and adults are even more likely to mindlessly copy others' actions, and infants are less likely to over-imitate—that is, to precisely copy even impractical actions.
2023 年 6 月英语六级真题第 3 套  第 5 页，共 6 页

　　　By contrast, chimpanzees in the study only over-imitated in the opaque condition. In the transparent condition-where they  saw that the  stick was mechanically useless-they ignored that  step entirely. Other research has since supported these findings.
When it comes to copying, chimpanzees are more rational than human children or adults.
　　　Where does the seemingly irrational human preference for over-imitation come from? Anthropologist Joseph Henrich points out that people around the world rely on technologies that are often so complex that no one can learn them rationally. Instead, people must learn them step by step, trusting in the wisdom of more experienced elders and peers.
　　　So the next time you hear someone arguing passionately that everyone should embrace nonconformity and avoid imitating others, you might laugh a little bit. We're not chimpanzees, after all.
51. What might explain humans' having the largest population of almost all mammals?
A) They are equipped with raw strength for solving the most challenging problems.
B) They cope with the outside world more effectively than their animal relatives.
C) They possess the most outstanding ability to think.
D) They kno whow to survive everywhere on earth.
52. What accounts for humans' evolutionary successes according to a growing number of cognitive scientists and anthropologists?
A) They are better at innovating solutions.
B) They thrive through creative strategies.
C) They are naturally adaptive to ecological contexts.
D) They meet challenges by imitating others carefully.
53. What does the author think is odd about the findings of the study by Victoria Horner and Andrew Whiten?
A) Children irrationally imitated every action of the experimenters.
B) Chimpanzees could tell the transparent box from the opaque one.
C) Chimpanzees could retrieve the treat more quickly than children did.
D) Children omitted the step of tapping on the box with a stick to open it.
54. What is anthropologist Joseph Henrich's explanation for the human preference for copying?
A) It originates in the rationality of people around the world.
B) It stems from the way people learn complex technologies.
C) It results from people distrusting their own wisdom.
D) It derives from the desire to acquire knowledge step by step.
55. What point does the author want to emphasize when he says "We're not chimpanzees"? A) It is arguable whether everyone should avoid imitation.
B) It is characteristic of human beings to copy others.
C) It is desirable to trust in more knowledgeable peers.
D) It is naive to laugh at someone embracing nonconformity.

　　　Our brains respond to language expressing facts differently than they do to words conveying possibility,scientists at New York University have recently found.Their work offers new insights into the impact word choice has on how we    26   between  statements  expressing  what  is  real  versus what is merely possible.The researchers assert their findings are important because we are presented with false information all the time.Some of this is .  27   ,as is the case with deceptive advertisements,but  the  problem  is      28   by individuals who believe they are  sharing correct  information.Thus,it is more important than ever to separate the factual from the possible or merely  29   in how we communicate.This is especially true as the  study makes clear that information  presented as fact     30special responses in our brains,which are distinct from when we process the same content with clear indicators of _31     .

African countries must get smarter with their agriculture
A)On the hills of central Kenya,almost lime-green with the sparkle of tea bushes in the  sunlight, farmers know all about climate change.“The rainy season is no longer predictable,”says one. “When it is supposed to rain it doesn't,then it all comes at once.”Climate change is an issue that  will  affect  everyone  on  the  planet.For  Africans  its  consequences  will  be  particularly  bitter: whereas other regions were able to grow rich by burning coal and oil,Africa will pay much of the human  price  without  having   enjoyed  the  benefits.“Africa   only  represents  2%of  global  greenhouse-gas emissions but it is the continent that is expected to suffer the most from climate impacts,”says Mafalda Duarte,who runs the World Bank's $8bn Climate Investment Funds.
B)Although  there  are  huge  uncertainties  as  to  the  precise  impacts  of climate  change,enough  is known to say that global warming represents one of the main threats to Africa's prosperity.Parts of the  continent  are  already  warming  much  more  quickly  than  the  average:temperatures  in southern Africa have increased by about twice the global rate over the past 50 years.Even if the world were to cut emissions enough to keep global warming below  1.5℃,heat-waves  would intensify in Africa and diseases would spread to areas not currently affected.Farming would also be hit hard.About  40%of  the land now used to grow maize(玉米)would no longer be suitable for it.Overall,it is estimated that maize yields would fall by 18-22%.
C)Africa is particularly vulnerable,in part because it is already struggling to feed itself and it will have to vastly increase yields and productivity if it is to put food on the plates of a fast-growing population,even without climate change.The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation reckons that by 2050 global food production would have to rise by about 70%over its level of 2009 to meet demand  from  a population that is growing in numbers  and  appetite.Much  of this new demand will be in Africa.Yet the continent already imports about $50bn-worth of food a year and that  figure  is  expected  to  more  than  double  over  the  next  five  years.Self-sufficiency  is  not

Africa's goal,but the fact that it  spends more money importing  food than it does buying  capital goods suggests it has room for improvement.
D)Finding  out  why  is  not  hard.Most   farms   are  tiny,ploughed  by  hand   and  reliant   on  rain.More than  half  of  Africa's   people  make  their  living  from  farming.Although  its  total  harvest  has  climbed  over  the  past  few  decades,this  is  mainly  because  there  are  more  people  farming  more land.But  in  many places  there  is  no  spare  land  to  farm.Plots  in  Rwanda  are  so  small  that  you  could  fit  250  of  them  onto  the  average  American  farm.And  although  output  per  worker  has  improved by more than half over the past 30 years in Africa,that is still far behind the 2.5 times  improvement  in  Asia.Yields  of maize  are  generally  less  than  two  tonnes  per  hectare,a  fifth  the  level in America.
E)The  low  productivity  of  African   farmers  is  reflected   in  national   economic  statistics  —despite absorbing   so  much   labour,farming   generates  just   15%of   GDP.“They   can't   even   feed  their families,”says  Jennifer  Blanke,a  vice-president  of  the  African  Development  Bank  in  charge  of agriculture.“Farm productivity hasn't improved in many parts of Africa for  100 years.”
F)One   reason   is that in the first few decades of  independence,many  African governments neglected farming as they focused on industrialising their economies.Others damaged it by pushing down the prices that state monopolies paid for their crops in order to subsidise workers in cities with cheap food.Ghana  taxed  cocoa (可可粉)exports so heavily that production collapsed by half between the 1960s and  1980s,despite a jump in the global price of cocoa.Yet over the past two decades or so governments and donors have begun to look again at farming as a way of providing jobs for the 13 million young people  entering  the  workforce  each  year.Much  of the  focus  has  been  on  getting small  farmers  to  use   fertiliser  and,more  important,better   seeds.The  results   can  be   impressive. Improved varieties of sorghum(高粱),for instance,can produce a crop that is 40%larger than the usual  variety.Infrastructure  is  important.A  World  Bank  irrigation  project  in  Ethiopia  helped farmers increase their potato harvest from about 8 tonnes per hectare to 35 tonnes.
G)Better  techniques  help,too.Small  coffee  farmers  in  Kenya  are  able  to  increase  their  incomes  by 40%by  following  a  few simple  guidelines  on caring   for  their  bushes,such  as  trimming all  but three   of   their    stems.Many  of  their  neighbours   do   not  follow  the  advice,because     it  seems counter-intuitive.More  stems  ought  to  lead  to  more  coffee  beans,they  say.Yet  after  seeing  those following the advice get bigger harvests for a season or two,many others start doing the same.
H)One way of spreading knowledge is to link farms to big buyers of their harvests.When Diageo,a British drinks giant,built a brewery in western Kenya,it wanted to use local crops to make a beer cheap  enough  to  compete  with  illicit  home  brew.It  organised  farmers  into  groups,improved supply  chains  for  them  to  get  seeds  and  fertiliser  and  then  agreed  to  buy  their  grain.It  now provides a market to about  17,000  farmers.Across the region it has doubled its use of local raw material to  about  80%over  five  years,says John  O'Keeffe,who runs  its Africa business.
I)An  even  more  important  change  is  the  move  from  traditional  farming  to  building  businesses  that can profitably bring technology  and  investment to  small  farmers.Taita Ngetich,a  young Kenyan, was studying engineering when he wanted to earn a little money on the side.He scraped together 20,000  Kenyan  shillings (about  $200)to   plant   tomatoes.Everything   went wrong.The    crop  was attacked  by  pests.“Then  there  was  a  massive  flood  that  swallowed  all  our  capital,”he  says.Mr Ngetich persevered by looking into buying a greenhouse to protect his plants from bugs and rain.  The  cheapest  ones  cost  more  than  $2,500  each,so  he  designed  his  own  for  half the  price.Soon neighbouring  farmers  started  placing  orders  with  him,and  now  his  firm,Illuminum  Greenhouses, has  sold  more  than   1,400   greenhouses  that  provide  livelihoods  to  about  6,000  people.The business  does  not  stop  there;he  also  supplies  fertiliser,high-quality  seedlings  and  smart  sensors
2023年12月英语六级真题第1套第5 页 共 9 页 by: 光速考研

that increase yields.
J)Illuminum's success shows how technology can help even small farms become more productive.
Because such a large share of Africa's population earns a living from agriculture,even small improvements in productivity can lift the incomes of millions of people.But over the longer run small-scale farming can go only so far,especially in the face of climate change and population pressure.
K)“If we really want to lift people out of poverty we have to finance projects that will get them an income of at least $100 a month so that they can pay for health care and education,"says Mr Ngetich.“Projects that give them an extra $2 a month from growing beans or maize aren't going to get them there.”Getting those big jumps will need better jobs in factories and cities.

36.It is said that agricultural productivity in many African countries has remained low for a century.
37.Building connections between farms and major purchasers of their produce can promote African farmers'use  of advanced farming techniques.
38.Parts of Africa are getting warmer much faster than the average,with southern Africa witnessing roughly twice the global warming rate over the last half century.
39.Improved farming practices have enabled Kenyan farmers to increase farm produce remarkably.
40.Africa is especially susceptible to the effects of global warming partly because it has difficulty feeding its increasing population even without climate change.
41.The  use of fertiliser and improved seeds can help Africa'small  farmers  impressively  increase crop yields
42.It has proved even more important to shift from traditional farming to setting up businesses that can bring technology and investment to small farmers in Africa.
43.Everyone in the world will have to bear the consequences of climate change,especially Africans.
44.Improvement in farm output per worker in Africa falls far short of that in Asia.
45.In the long term,the potential for small farms in Africa to increase productivity is quite limited, especially owing to the warming climate and a growing population.

Section  C
Directions:  There  are 2 passages  in this section.Each passage  is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　One  of  the  great  successes  of  the  Republican  Party  in  recent   decades  is  the  relentless propagation of a simple formula for economic growth:tax cuts.
　　　The formula doesn't work,but that has not affected its popularity.And while the cult of tax cuts has attracted many critics,it lacks for obvious rivals.
　　　Democratic politicians have tended to campaign on helping people left behind by economic growth.When  Democrats  do  talk  about  encouraging  economic  growth,they  often  sound  like Republicans
This is not just a political problem for Democrats;it is an economic problem for the United

States.The nation needs a better story about the drivers of economic growth.The painful lessons of recent decades point to a promising candidate:higher wages.
　　Raising the wages of American workers  ought to be the priority of economic policymakers.  We'd all be better off paying less attention to quarterly updates on the growth of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP)and focusing instead on the growth of workers'paychecks.
　　Set aside,for the moment,the familiar argument for higher wages:fairness.The argument here is that higher wages can fuel the engine of economic growth.
　　Perhaps the most famous illustration of the benefits is the  story of Henry Ford's decision in   1914 to pay $5 a day to workers on his Model T assembly lines.He did it to increase production-he was paying a premium to maintain a reliable workforce.The unexpected benefit was that Ford's factory workers became Ford customers,too.
　　The same logic still holds:Consumption drives the American  economy,and  workers  who are paid more can spend more.
　　Mainstream economists insist that it is impossible to order up a sustainable increase in wages because compensation levels reflect the unerring judgment of market forces.
　　The conventional wisdom held that productivity growth was the only route to higher wages.  Through  that  lens,efforts to  negotiate  higher wages  were counterproductive.Minimum-wage laws would raise unemployment because there was only so much money in the wage pool,and if some people got more,others would get none.
　　It was in the context of this worldview that it became popular to argue that tax cuts would drive prosperity.Rich people would invest,productivity would increase,wages would rise.
　　In the real  world,things are  more  complicated.Wages are influenced by a tug of war between  employers  and  workers,and  employers  have  been  winning.One  clear  piece  of  evidence  is  the widening gap between productivity growth and wage growth since roughly  1970.Productivity has more than doubled;wages have lagged far behind.
　　A focus on wage growth would provide an antidote(矫正方法)to the attractive simplicity of the belief in the magical power of tax cuts.
46.Why does the formula of tax cuts remain popular though ineffective?
A)Its critics'voice has not been heard throughout the country.
B)There seem to be no other options available to replace it.
C)The cult of tax cuts has been relentlessly propagated by all policymakers.
D)There appears to be a misunderstanding of the formula among the public.
47.What does the author think is a more effective measure for driving economic growth in the U.S.? A)Aiding people left behind by economic growth.
B)Prioritizing the growth of the nation's GDP.
C)Increasing  the compensation for labor.
D)Introducing even more extensive tax cuts.
48.What is the logic underlying the author's viewpoint?
A)The growth of workers'paychecks ultimately boosts the nation's economy. B)Paying a premium to maintain a reliable workforce attracts more customers.
C)Consumption stimulates the desire for higher wages.
D)Familiar arguments for higher wages are outdated.

49.What is the basis for higher wages according to the conventional wisdom?
A)Fairness in distribution.                                C)The priority of economic policymakers.
B)Increase in productivity.               D)The unerring judgment of market forces.
50.What do we learn about things in the real world in America for the past 50 years or so?
A)People have failed to see a corresponding increase in wages and in productivity.
B)People have been disheartened by the widening gap between the haves and have-nots.  C)People have witnessed a tug of war between Republicans and Democrats over tax cuts. D)People  have seen the link disappearing between productivity and workers'well-being.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Journal  editors  decide  what  gets  published  and  what  doesn't,affecting  the  careers  of  other academics and influencing the direction that a field takes.You'd hope,then,that journals would do everything they can to establish a diverse editorial board,reflecting a variety of voices,experiences, and identities.
Unfortunately a new study in Nature Neuroscience makes for disheartening reading.The team
finds that the majority of editors in top psychology and neuroscience journals are male and based in the United States:a situation that may be amplifying existing gender inequalities in the field and influencing the kind of research that gets published.
　　　Men  were  found  to  account  for  60%of   the   editors   of  psychology   journals.There   were significantly more male than female editors at each level of seniority,and men made up the majority of editors  in  over  three  quarters  of the  journals.Crucially,the  proportion  of  female  editors  was significantly lower than the overall proportion of women psychology researchers.
　　　The differences were even starker in the neuroscience journals:70%of editors were male,and men held the majority of editorial positions in 88%of journals.In this case,the proportion of female editors  was  not   significantly  lower  than  the  proportion  of  female  researchers  working  in neuroscience—a finding that reveals enduring gender disparities in the field more broadly.
　　　Based on their results,the team concludes that "the ideas,values and decision-making biases of men  are  overrepresented in the  editorial positions  of the most recognized  academic jourmals  in psychology and neuroscience.”
　　　Gender inequality in science is often attributed to the fact that senior academics are more likely to be male,because historically science was male-dominated:it's argued that as time goes on and more women rise to senior roles,the field will become more equal.Yet this study showed that even the junior roles in psychology journals tended to be held disproportionately by men,despite the fact that there are actually more female than male junior psychology faculty.
　　　This implies that a lack of female academics is not the problem.Instead,there are structural reasons that women are disadvantaged in science.Women receive lower salaries and face greater childcare demands,for instance,which can result in fewer publications and grants—the kinds of things that journals look for when deciding who to appoint.Rather than simply blaming the inequality of editorial boards on tradition,we should be actively breaking down these existing barriers.
　　　A  lack  of diversity  among  journal  editors  also  likely  contributes  to  psychology's  WEIRD problem.If journal  editors  are largely men  from the United  States,then they will probably place higher value on papers that are relevant to Western,male populations,whether consciously or not.

Treasure Fever
A)Most  visitors  come  to  Cape  Canaveral,on  the  northeast  coast  of  Florida,for  the  tourist attractions.It's home to the second-busiest cruise ship port in the world and is a gateway to the cosmos.Nearly 1.5 million visitors flock here every year to watch rockets,spacecraft,and satellites blast off into the solar system from Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.Nearly 64 kilometers of undeveloped beach and 648 square kilometers of protected refuge fan out from the cape's sandy shores.
B)Yet some of Cape Canaveral's most legendary attractions lie unseen,wedged under the sea's surface in mud and sand,for this part of the world has a reputation as a deadly ship trap.Over the  centuries,dozens of majestic Old World sailing ships smashed and sank on this irregular stretch of windy Florida coast.They were vessels built for war and commerce,crossing the globe carrying everything from coins to cannons,boxes of silver and gold,chests of jewels and porcelain,and pearls from the Caribbean.
C)Cape  Canaveral  contains  one  of the  greatest  concentrations  of colonial  shipwrecks  in  the world.In  recent  years,advances  in  radar,diving,detection  equipment,computers,and  GPS have transformed the hunt.The naked eye might see a pile of rocks,but technology can reveal the precious artifacts(人工制品)that lie hidden on the ocean floor.

E)High-stakes fights over shipwrecks pit archaeologists against treasure hunters in a vicious cycle of accusations.Archaeologists regard themselves  as protectors  of history,and  they  see  salvors as careless destroyers.Salvors feel they do the hard work of searching for ships,only to have them stolen from under them when discovered.This kind of clash inevitably takes place on a grand  scale.Aside  from  the  salvors,their  investors,and  the  maritime  archaeologists  who  serve as expert witnesses,the battles sweep in local and international governments and organizations like UNESCO that work to protect under-water heritage.The  court  cases that ensue stretch on for years.Are finders keepers,or do the ships belong to the countries that made them and sent them  sailing  centuries ago?Where  once  salvors  and  archaeologists  worked  side by   side,now they belong to opposing,and equally contemptuous,tribes.
F)Nearly  three  million  vessels  lie  wrecked  on  the  Earth's  ocean  floor—from  old  canoes  to  the Titanic—and  likely  less  than  one  percent have been  explored.Some—like  an  ancient  Roman ship  found  off  Antikythera,Greece,dated  between  70  and  60  BC  and  carrying  astonishingly sophisticated gears and dials for navigating by the sun—are critical to a new understanding of our past.No wonder there is an eternal  stirring among everybody from  salvors to  scholars to find them
G)In  May  2016,a  salvor  named  Bobby  Pritchett,president  of  Global  Marine  Exploration  (GME) in  Tampa,Florida,announced  that  he  had   discovered  scattered  remains   of  a   ship  buried   a  kilometer  off  Cape  Canaveral.Over  the  prior  three  years,he  and  his  crew  had  obtained   14  state permits to survey a nearly 260-square-kilometer area off the cape;they worked 250 days  a   year,backed   by   investor    funds   of,he   claims,US    $4   million.It   was   hard   work.Crew   members were up at dawn,dragging sensors from their expedition vessels back and forth,day  in  and  day  out,year  after  year,to  detect  metal  of  any   kind.Using   computer  technology,  Pritchett  and  his  crew  created  intricate,color-coded  maps  marked  with  the  GPS  coordinates  of thousands of finds,all invisible under a meter of sand.
H)One  day  in  2015,the  magnetometer(磁力计)picked  up metal that turned out to be an iron cannon;when  the  divers  blew  the  sand  away,they  also  discovered  a  more  precious  bronze cannon  with  markings   indicating   French  royalty   and,not  far  off,a  famous  marble   column carved  with  the  coat  of  arms  of  France,known  from  historical  paintings.The  discovery  was cause  for  celebration.The  artifacts  indicated  the  divers  had  likely  found  the  wreck  of  La Trinite,a   16th-century  French  vessel that  had been at the center of a  bloody battle  between France and Spain that changed the fate of the United States of America.
I)And  then  the  legal   storm  began,with  GME  and  Pritchett  pitted  against  Florida  and  France. The  Sunken  Military  Craft  Act of  2004,a  US  federal  act,protects  any  vessel  that  was  on  a military  mission,allowing  the  originating  country to claim their ship even centuries   later.In  2018,two  long  years   after  Pritchett's   discovery,the  federal  district  court  ruled   in  favor  of France.For Pritchett,the  decision  was  devastating.Millions  of dollars  of investor  funding  and  years of labor were lost.
J)But  this  is  far  from  the  first  time  a  salvor  has   lost  all  rights  to  a  discovery.In  2012,for instance,Spain  won  a  five-year  legal  battle  against  Odyssey  Marine  Exploration,which  had  hauled 594,000 gold and silver coins from a  Spanish wreck off the coast of Portugal  across the  Atlantic  to  the  United   States.“Treasure   hunters   can   be   naive,”says   attorney   David
Concannon,who  has  had  several  maritime  archaeologists  as clients  and  represented two sides 2023年12月英语六级真题第2套 第5 页 共 9 页 by: 光速考研

in the battles over the Titanic for 20 years.“Many treasure hunters don't understand they are going to have to fight for their rights against a government that has an endless supply of money for legal battles that treasure hunters are likely to lose.”
K)Putting  an  inflated  price  on  artifacts  rather  than  viewing  them  as  cultural  and  historical  treasures that transcend any price is what irritates many archaeologists.For the archaeologist, everything in a wreck matters—hair,fabric,a fragment of a newspaper,rat bones—all things speak volumes.Archaeologists don't want artifacts ending up in a private collection instead of taking humanity on a journey of understanding.
L)George Bass is one of the pioneers of under-water archaeology,and a researcher at Texas A&M University.He has testified in court against treasure hunters,but says archaeology is not without its  own  serious problems.He believes  archaeologists  need to  do  a better job themselves  instead  of  routinely  criticizing  treasure  hunters.“Archaeology  has  a  terrible reputation for not publishing enough on its excavations(发掘)and  finds,”he  says.Gathering data,unearthing  and  meticulously  preserving  and  examining  finds,verifying  identity  and  origin,piecing together the larger story,and writing and publishing a comprehensive paper or book  can  take  decades.A  bit  cynically,Bass  describes  colleagues  who  never  published because they waited  so  long they became ill  or died.Who is more  at  fault,Bass  asks,the professional archaeologist who carefully excavates a site and never publishes on it or the treasure hunter who locates a submerged wreck,salvages part,conserves part,and publishes a book on the operation?
M)Pritchett concedes that his find deserves careful excavation and preservation."I think what I  found should go in a museum,”he says.“But I also think I should get paid for what I found.” Indeed,it's  a  bit  of  a  mystery  why  governments,archaeologists,and  treasure  hunters  can't  work together—and why salvors aren't at least given a substantial finder's fee before the  original owner takes possession of the vessel and its artifacts.

36.Exploration  of  shipwrecks  on  the  sea  floor  is  crucial  in  updating  our  understanding  of humanity's past.
37.Quite  a number  of majestic  ships  sailing  from  Europe  to  America  were  wrecked  off the Florida coast over the centuries.
38.Pritchett suffered a heavy loss when a US district court ruled against him.
39.Recently,people who found treasures in shipwrecks have been sued over their rights to own them.
40.Pritchett  claims  he  got  support  of  millions  of  dollars  from  investors  for  his  shipwreck exploration
41.One pioneer marine scientist thinks archaeologists should make greater efforts to publish their findings
42.With  technological   advancement  in  recent  years,salvors  now   can   detect  the   invaluable man-made objects lying buried under the sea.
43.According to a lawyer,many treasure hunters are susceptible to loss because they are unaware they face a financially stronger opponent in court.
44.Salvors of treasures in sunken ships and marine archaeologists are now hostile to each other.
45.Archaeologists want to see artifacts help humans understand their past instead of being sold to private collectors at an outrageous price.

Section  C
Directions:  There  are  2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Could you  get by without using the  internet  for  four  and  a  half years?That's  exactly  what singer and actress Selena Gomez has done in a bid to improve her mental health.
　　　She has  spoken  extensively  about the relationship between her  social media usage  and her mental  wellbeing,recalling  feeling  like  “an  addict”when  she  became  Instagram's  most  followed user in 2016.“Taking a break from social media was the best decision that I've ever made for my  mental  health”,says  she.“The  unnecessary  hate  and  comparisons  went  away  once  I  put  my phone down.”
　　　Ditching  the  web  at  large,however,is  a  far  more  subtle  and  complicated  prospect.The increasing digitisation of our  society means that everything from paying a gas bill to plotting a route to a friend's house and even making a phone call is at the mercy of your internet connection. Actively opting out of using the internet becomes a matter of privilege.
　　　Ms Gomez's multi-millionaire  status has allowed her to take the“social”out of social media, so she can continue to leverage her enormous fame while keeping the trolls (恶意挑衅的帖子)at bay.The fact that she's still the second most-followed woman on Instagram suggests it's entirely   possible to maintain a significant web profile to promote various projects—by way of a dedicated  team—without being exposed to the cruel comments,hate mail and rape or death threats.
It goes without saying that this is fundamentally different from how the rest of us without
beauty  deals  and  films  to  publicise  use the  likes  of Instagram,TikTok  and  Twitter,but  even  the concept  of  a  digital  detox ( 戒 瘾 ) requires  having   a  device  and  connectivity  to  choose  to disconnect  from.
　　　The  UK's  digital  divide  has  worsened  over  the  past  two  years,leaving  poorer  families without  broadband  connections  in  their  homes.Digital  exclusion  is  a  major  threat  to  wider societal  equality  in  the  UK,so  witnessing  companies  like  Facebook  championing  the  metaverse ( 元 宇 宙 )as  the  next   great  frontier  when   school  children  are  struggling  to  complete  their homework  feels particularly   irritating
　　　Consequently,it's  worth  bearing  in  mind  that  while  deleting  all  social  media  accounts  will undoubtedly make some feel infinitely better,many other people benefit from the strong sense of community that sharing platforms can breed.
　　　Internet access will continue to grow in importance as we edge further towards web 3.0,and greater resources  and initiatives  are needed to provide the underprivileged with the  connectivity they  desperately  need  to  learn,work  and  live.It's  crucial that people who feel that social media is having a detrimental effect on their mental health are allowed to switch off and for those living in digital exclusion to be able to switch on in the first place.
46.What do we learn about singer and actress Selena Gomez in the past four and a half years?   A)She has had worsening mental problems.C)She has refrained  from using  social media. B)She has won Instagram's most followers.D)She has succeeded in a bid on the internet.

B)The concept of the metaverse is believed to be still quite illusory.
C)School children would be drawn farther away from the real world.
D)Most families in the UK do not have stable broadband connections.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Psychologists have long  been in  disagreement as to whether competition  is a learned or a genetic  component  of  human  behavior.Whatever  it  is,you  cannot  but  recognize  the  effect  competition is exerting in academics and many other areas of contemporary life.
　　　Psychologically speaking,competition has been seen as an inevitable consequence of human drives.According to Sigmund Freud,humans are born screaming for attention and full of organic drives  for  fulfillment  in  various  areas.Initially,we  compete  for  the  attention  of  our  parents. Thereafter,we  are  at the mercy of a battle between our base impulses for self-fulfillment and social and cultural norms which prohibit pure indulgence.
　　　Current work in anthropology(人类学)has suggested,however,that this view of the role of competition in human behavior may be incorrect.Thomas Hobbes,one of the great philosophers of the seventeenth century,is perhaps best remembered for his characterization of the "natural world", that is,the world before the imposition of the will of humanity,as being "nasty,brutish,and short." This image of the pre-rational world is still widely held,reinforced by Charles Darwin's highly  influential work,The Origin of Species,which established the doctrine of natural selection.This  doctrine,which takes for granted that those species best able to adapt to and master the natural  environment in which they live will survive,has suggested that the struggle for survival is an  inherent  human  trait  which  determines   a  person's   success.Darwin's  theory  has   even  been  summarized as“survival of the fittest”—a phrase Darwin himself never used—further highlighting competition'role  in  success.As  it  has  often  been  pointed  out,however,there  is  nothing  in  the  concept of natural selection that suggests that competition is the most successful strategy for  “survival  of the  fittest.”Darwin  asserted  in  The  Origin  of  Species that the  struggles  he was  describing should be viewed as metaphors and could easily include dependence and cooperation.
　　　Many studies have been conducted to test the importance placed on competition as opposed to other values,such as cooperation—by various cultures,and generally conclude that Americans uniquely  praise  competition  as  natural,inevitable,and   desirable.In   1937,the  world-renowned

anthropologist Margaret Mead published Cooperation and Competition among Primitive Peoples, based on her studies of several societies that did not prize competition,and,in fact,seemed at times to place a negative value on it.One such society was the Zuni Indians of Arizona,and they, Mead  found,valued  cooperation  far  more  than   competition.After  studying  dozens  of  such cultures,Mead's final conclusion was that competitiveness is a culturally created aspect of human behavior,and that its prevalence in a particular society is relative to how that society values it.
51.What does the author think is easy to see in many areas of contemporary life?
A)The disagreement on the inevitability of competition.
B)The consequence of psychological investigation.
C)The  effect of human drives.
D)The impact of competition.
52.According to psychology,what do people strive to do following the initial stage of their life? A)Fulfill individual needs without incurring adverse effects of human drives.
B)Indulge in cultural pursuits while keeping their base impulses at bay.
C)Gain  extensive recognition without exposing pure indulgence.
D)Satisfy their own desires while observing social conventions.
53.What do we learn about the “natural world”characterized by Thomas Hobbes? A)It gets misrepresented by philosophers and anthropologists.
B)It gets distorted in Darwin's The Origin of Species.
C)It is free from the rational intervention of humans.
D)It is the pre-rational world rarely appreciated nowadays.
54.What can we conclude from Darwin's assertion in The Origin of Species?
A)All species inherently depend on others for survival.
B)Struggles for survival do not exclude mutual support.
C)Competition weighs as much as cooperation as a survival strategy.
D)The strongest species proves to be the fittest in natural selection.
55.What conclusion did Margaret Mead reach after studying dozens of different cultures? A)It is characteristic of humans to be competitive.
B)Americans are uniquely opposed to cooperation.
C)Competition is relatively more prevalent in Western societies.
D)People's attitude towards competition is actually culture-bound.

Section  B
Directions:In this section,you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it.Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs.Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived.You may choose a paragraph more than once.Each paragraph is marked with a letter:Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Can Learning a Foreign Language Prevent Dementia?
A)You may have heard that learning another language is one method for preventing or at least  postponing the onset of dementia.Dementia refers to the loss of cognitive abilities,and one of its most common forms is Alzheimer's disease(阿尔茨海默氏病).At this time,the causes of the disease are not well understood,and consequently,there are no proven steps that people  can take to prevent it.Nonetheless,some researchers have  suggested that learning a foreign  language might help delay the onset of dementia.
B)To  explore this possibility more deeply,let's look at  some  of the  common misconceptions about  dementia  and the  aging brain.First  of all,dementia  is  not  an  inevitable part  of the normal aging process.Most older adults do not develop Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia.It is also important to remember that dementia is not the same thing as normal forgetfulness.At any age,we might experience difficulty finding the exact word we want or have trouble remembering the name of the person we just met.People with dementia have more serious problems,like feeling confused or getting lost in a familiar place.Think of it this way:If you forget where you parked your car at the mall,that's normal;if you forget how to drive a  car,that may be a signal that something more serious is going on.
C)The idea that dementia can be prevented is based on the comparison of the brain to a muscle.  When people talk about the brain,they sometimes say things like "It is important to exercise  your brain"or “To stay mentally fit,you have to give your brain a workout.”Although these are colorful analogies,in reality the brain is not a muscle.Unlike muscles,the brain is always active and works even during periods of rest and sleep.In addition,although some muscle  cells have a lifespan of only a few days,brain cells last a lifetime.Not only that,but it has been shown that new brain cells are being created throughout one's lifespan.
D)While it makes  for  a  colorful  analogy,comparing  the brain to  a muscle  is  inaccurate  and misleading.So,if   the brain is not a muscle,can   it  still be exercised?Once again,researchers  don't know for sure.There are now many computer,online,and mobile device applications that claim to be able to "train your brain,"and they typically tap into a variety of cognitive abilities.However,research  suggests that although this type of training may improve one's abilities at the tasks themselves,they don't seem to improve other abilities.In other words, practicing  a  letter-detection  task  will,over  time,improve  your  letter-detection  skills,but  it will not necessarily enhance your other perceptual abilities.
E)However,there is some reason to believe that learning languages might be different.The best evidence that foreign language learning confers cognitive benefits comes from research with those who are already bilingual(双语的).Bilingualism most commonly occurs when children are exposed to two languages,either in the home (mom speaks Dutch,dad speaks Spanish)or more formally in early schooling.But bilingualism certainly occurs in adulthood as well.
F)Bilingualism and multilingualism are actually more common than you might think.In fact,it has been estimated that there are fewer monolingual speakers in the world than bilinguals and multilinguals.Although  in  many  countries  most  inhabitants  share just  one  language,other countries   have    several    official    languages.Switzerland,for    example,has    four   official languages:German,French,Italian,and  Romansh.Throughout  large  parts  of  Africa,Arabic,
2023年12月英语六级真题第3套第2 页 共 7 页 by: 光速考研

Swahili,French,and English  are  often  known  and used by  individuals who  speak  a  different, native   language   in   their   home   than   they   do   in   the   marketplace.So   bilingualism   and multilingualism  are to be  found throughout the world.And with regard to  cognitive  abilities, the research on those who speak more than one language paints an encouraging picture.
G)For  one  thing,bilinguals  are  better  at  multitasking.One  explanation  of  this  superiority  is  that speakers  of two  languages  are  continually  inhibiting  one  of their  languages,and  this  process of   inhibition    confers    general     cognitive    benefits    to    other    activities.In    fact,bilingual individuals outperform their monolingual counterparts on a variety of cognitive tasks,such   as following    complex    instructions,and    switching    to    new    instructions.For    the     sake    of completeness,it  should  be  noted  that  the   advantages   of  being  bilingual   are  not  universal  across   all   cognitive    domains.Bilingual   individuals    have   been   shown    to   have    smaller  vocabularies   and  to  take   longer  in  retrieving  words   from  memory  when   compared  to monolinguals.In   the    long  run,however,the     cognitive     and linguistic  advantages  of  being bilingual far outweigh these two drawbacks.
H)If  the  benefits   of  being  bilingual   spill  over  to  other  aspects  of cognition,then   we    would expect to see a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease in bilinguals than in monolinguals,or  at  least  a  later  onset  of  Alzheimer's  for  bilinguals.In  fact,there  is  evidence  to  support  this claim.The  psychologist  Ellen  Bialystok  and  her  colleagues  obtained  the  histories  of  184 individuals who had made use of a memory clinic in Toronto.For those who showed signs of dementia,the monolinguals in the sample had an average age of 71.4 years at time of onset.  The  bilinguals,in  contrast,received  their  diagnosis  at  75.5  years,on  average.In  a  study  of this  sort,a  difference  of four years  is highly  significant,and  could not be  explained by  other systematic  differences  between  the  two  groups.For  example,the  monolinguals  reported,on average,a year  and  a  half more  schooling  than  their bilingual  counterparts,so  the  effect  was clearly not due to formal education.
I)A    separate    study,conducted    in     India,found    strikingly    similar    results:bilingual    patients developed symptoms of dementia 4.5 years later than monolinguals,even after other potential  factors,such   as    gender   and   occupation,were    controlled    for.In   addition,researchers   have  reported other positive effects of bilingualism for cognitive abilities in later life,even when the person  acquired  the  language  in  adulthood.Crucially,Bialystok  suggested  that  the  positive benefits of being bilingual were only found in those who used both languages all the time.
J)But encouraging as these kinds of studies are,they still have not established exactly how or why differences between bilinguals and monolinguals exist.Because these studies looked back at the histories  of people  who  were   already  bilingual,the  results   can  only  say  that   a  difference between  the  two  groups  was  found,but  not  why  that  difference  occurred.Further  research  is needed to determine what caused the differences in age of onset between the two groups.
K)Other   studies   of  successful   aging   suggest   that  being  connected  to  one's  community  and having plenty of social interaction is also important in delaying or even preventing the onset of   dementia.Once again,however,the  results  are  far  less  clear  than  the popular  media  might lead  you  to  believe.Older  individuals  who  lead  active  social  lives  are,almost  by  definition, healthier than their  counterparts who rarely  leave  their homes  or  interact  with  others.So  we can't really say whether being socially active prevents the onset of dementia,or if people who don't have dementia are more likely to be socially active.
L)But even if studying a foreign language is not a magical cure-all,there is one thing it will do: It will make you a better speaker of a foreign language.Doing that confers a whole host of advantages we do know about.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Research is meant to benefit society by raising public awareness and creating products and innovations that  enhance  development.For  research  to  serve  its  full  purpose,the  results  must leave the confines of research laboratories and academic journals.
　　　Findings effectively communicated can go a long way to serve the interests of the public. They can help address social injustices or improve treatments offered to patients.
　　　Many researchers seem to be content with sharing the results of their studies in academic journals or at conferences.But few journals allow everybody to read the findings.Even articles freely available are usually written in academic language incomprehensible to the average reader.
　　　For researchers in the tenure-track system,their main goal is winning tenure,which in part can be achieved by getting a number of papers published in prominent journals.Pressures like this mean community-level outreach is not prioritised.
　　　Many researchers lack the writing skills to describe their results to a general audience.They may also worry about whether the public will understand their findings,or about findings being used to influence controversial policies.These concerns cause some researchers to shy away from communicating their findings outside the academic community.
　　　Propagating  research  findings  beyond  academic  publications  is  particularly  crucial  for addressing  certain  social  discrepancies.It  can  help  families,communities,healthcare  providers, policymakers,government agencies and other stakeholders to understand and respond to crises that plague society.

　　　The benefits of sharing findings flow both ways.Engaging with other researchers and the public can lead to unexpected new connections and new ideas that could suggest fruitful new directions for research.
　　　To  benefit  both  researchers  and  the  communities,the  need  to  find  innovative,accessible ways to share the work cannot be overstated.
　　　Institutions and funding organisations should support more researchers to publish in open access journals so that the public doesn't have to pay to read them.Institutions and researchers should invest in partnerships that expand capacity for sharing results more broadly.
　　　Furthermore,ethics  committees  should  make  it  mandatory  for  researchers  to  share  their results with the public.Every research participant should opt in or out of receiving results,as part of the process of giving informed consent.
　　　There  could  be misunderstanding of the findings presented by the researcher because of technical terms.But this can be resolved by researchers engaging the services of professional writers  or  communication  officers  to  help  with  translating  their  study  into  more  accessible language and share it widely with media outlets and the public.
　　　Sharing results with the people who are most affected by them makes us better researchers and ensures that our work can be used to improve people's lives.Institutions and collaborators must recognise the value of doing so.

46.How can research serve its full purpose according to the author?
A)With researchers being aware of public interests.
B)With its findings published in prominent journals.
C)With  researchers creating products that enhance social development.
D)With its findings properly communicated beyond the academic circle.
47.Why  do ordinary readers find it difficult to access the results of researchers'studies? A)They cannot understand the academic language used for reporting these results.  B)They feel intimidated by the jargon researchers use to describe their findings.
C)They do not attend conferences where these results are freely available.   D)They have few chances to locate the journals that publish these findings.
48.What is one of the reasons some researchers won't prioritise communicating their findings to the public?
A)They can thrive on the papers published.
B)Their top consideration is to win tenure.
C)Their main goal is gaining recognition in their field.
D)They have to struggle to reach out to the community.
49.How can sharing findings benefit researchers themselves?
A)By helping them to identify new research directions.
B)By enabling them to understand crises plaguing society.
C)By enabling them to effectively address social discrepancies.
D)By  helping them to forge ties with government agencies.
50.Why  are researchers advised to engage the services of professional writers or communication officers?
A)To satisfy ethics committees'mandatory requirements of researchers.
B)To translate their study into languages accessible to readers overseas.
C)To make their publications correctly understood by the public.
D)To render their findings acceptable by prominent journals.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Spiders make their presence felt in late August and through early autumn.This is the mating season of some of the most common varieties,when male house spiders come out of hidden corners to look for females,and garden spiders reach adult size and spin their most dazzling webs.
　　　Yet  while  the  spider   is  a  familiar  fixture  of  nursery  poems  or  songs  and  Halloween decorations,its  relationship  with  humans  is  complicated.Fear  of  spiders  is  common  and  has serious  impacts  on  the  lives  of  sufferers.Its  prevalence   appears  unrelated  to   any  rational assessment of risk.Spiders in the UK are almost all harmless.Farmland species perform valuable ecosystem  services,by  preying  on  insects  that  are  our  competitors  for  crops.But  they  are  a constant source of human anxieties—with a cultural association with witches and wickedness dating back to the middle ages.
　　　Does this perhaps explain,in part,the lack of data about how spiders are faring in our age of ecological crisis?British butterflies are the most studied group of insects in the world,due to the long tradition of collecting and observing them.But spider conservationists point out that it was only in the  1980s  that the classification of house  spiders was properly  sorted out.And while information about insect populations is gathered by experiments that measure the numbers hitting windscreens or traps,there have been few attempts to count spiders.
　　　The huge reductions in the numbers of flying insects can only mean a reduction in spiders’ food supply.A recent landmark study identified a 75%fall in insect populations between  1989  and 2016,with pesticide use thought to be to blame along with the destruction of wild areas for  development.This   means the overall picture for spiders  is  worrying,as it is for most creatures. But conservationists are most concerned about those varieties that are threatened due to habitat  loss and fragmentation,which makes it impossible for them to migrate.
　　　Of around 650 spider species regularly recorded in the UK,the majority thrive  in marshes and  wasteland.Conservation  efforts,often  led  by  determined  individuals,have  helped  some species  to  recover  by  reintroducing  them  to  new  areas.With  rewilding  now  firmly  on  the environmental policy agenda,the hope is that in future,spiders will be enabled to migrate by themselves,adapting to climate change by moving along wildlife corridors.
　　　It seems unlikely that spiders will ever attract the same level of human enthusiasm as bees, birds  or  butterflies,in  spite  of  their  unique   status  as  nature's   spinners.But  as  they  reveal themselves in all their splendour this autumn,it would be a good thing if more animal lovers recognised the ways in which spiders are simply terrific.
51.What  do we learn about spiders in the UK since the middle ages?
A)They have been generally misconceived.
B)They have adversely impacted crop growth.
C)They have been a constant reminder of bad luck.
D)They have made their presence felt when spinning webs.
52.What have spiders been associated with in the UK for centuries?
A)Harm.                           B)Evil.                       C)Suffering.            D)Aggression
53.What partly accounts for the reduction in spiders'food supply?
A)The long tradition of collecting insects.
B)Fast reproduction of their competitors.
C)Chemicals used for killing insects.
D)The extinction of a lot of wildlife.

54.What   does the passage  say  is conservationists'biggest      worry?
A)A  variety  of spiders  are  threatened  due  to  pollution  of marshes  and  wasteland. B)Certain  species  of  spiders  are  endangered  due  to  loss  of their  natural  homes.
C)An   increasing  number   of spiders  are  being  killed  by  deadly  pesticides.   D)More  and  more  spider  species  are  found  losing  their  ability  to  migrate.
55.What wish  does  the  author  express  close  to  the  end  of the  passage?
A)More   people   would   recognise   spiders'unique   status in the   ecosystem.
B)People  would  show  greater  enthusiasm  for  spiders  than  for  butterflies.
C)There   would  be  sufficient  corridors  for spiders  to  move  along.
D)There   would be  more people  appreciating   spiders'splendour.
