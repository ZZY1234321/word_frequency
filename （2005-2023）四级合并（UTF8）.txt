Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.
Passage One
Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage.
Scratchy throats, stuffy noses and body aches all spell misery, but being able to tell if the cause is a cold or flu (流感) may make a difference in how long the misery lasts.
The American Lung Association (ALA) has issued new guidelines on combating colds and the flu, and one of the keys is being able to quickly tell the two apart. That’s because the prescription drugs available for the flu need to be taken soon after the illness sets in. As for colds, the sooner a person starts taking over-the-counter remedy, the sooner relief will come.
The common cold and the flu are both caused by viruses. More than 200 viruses can cause cold symptoms, while the flu is caused by three viruses—flu A, B and C. There is no cure for either illness, but the flu can be prevented by the flu vaccine (疫苗), which is, for most people, the best way to fight the flu, according to the ALA.
But if the flu does strike, quick action can help. Although the flu and common cold have many similarities, there are some obvious signs to look for.
Cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose and scratchy throat typically develop gradually, and adults and teens often do not get a fever. On the other hand, fever is one of the characteristic features of the flu for all ages. And in general, flu symptoms including fever and chills, sore throat and body aches come on suddenly and are more severe than cold symptoms.
The ALA notes that it may be particularly difficult to tell when infants and preschool age children have the flu. It advises parents to call the doctor if their small children have flu-like symptoms.
Both cold and flu symptoms can be eased with over-the-counter medications as well. However, children and teens with a cold or flu should not take aspirin for pain relief because of the risk of Reye syndrome (综合症)，a rare but serious condition of the liver and central nervous system.
There is, of course, no vaccine for the common cold. But frequent hand washing and avoiding close contact with people who have colds can reduce the likelihood of catching one.
11.	According to the author, knowing the cause of the misery will help ________.
A) shorten the duration of the illness
B) the patient buy medicine over the counter
C) the patient obtain cheaper prescription drugs
D) prevent people from catching colds and the flu
12.	We learn from the passage that ________.
A) one doesn’t need to take any medicine if he has a cold or the flu
B) aspirin should not be included in over-the-counter medicines for the flu
C) delayed treatment of the flu will harm the liver and central nervous system
D) over-the-counter drugs can be taken to ease the misery caused by a cold or the flu
13.	According to the passage, to combat the flu effectively, ________.
A) one should identify the virus which causes it
B) one should consult a doctor as soon as possible
C) one should take medicine upon catching the disease
D) one should remain alert when the disease is spreading
14.	Which of the following symptoms will distinguish the flu from a cold?
A) A stuffy nose.
B) A high temperature.
C) A sore throat.
D) A dry cough.
15.	If children have flu-like symptoms, their parents ________.
A) are advised not to give them aspirin
B) should watch out for signs of Reye syndrome
C) are encouraged to take them to hospital for vaccination
D) should prevent them from mixing with people running a fever
Passage Two
Questions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage.
In a time of low academic achievement by children in the United States, many Americans are turning to Japan, a country of high academic achievement and economic success, for possible answers. However, the answers provided by Japanese preschools are not the ones Americans expected to find. In most Japanese preschools, surprisingly little emphasis is put on academic instruction. In one investigation, 300 Japanese and 210 American preschool teachers, child development specialists, and parents were asked about various aspects of early childhood education. Only 2 percent of the Japanese respondents (答问卷者) listed “to give children a good start academically” as one of their top three reasons for a society to have preschools. In contrast, over half the American respondents chose this as one of their top three choices. To prepare children for successful careers in first grade and beyond, Japanese schools do not teach reading, writing, and mathematics, but rather skills such as persistence, concentration, and the ability to function as a member of a group. The vast majority of young Japanese children are taught to read at home by their parents.
In the recent comparison of Japanese and American preschool education, 91 percent of Japanese respondents chose providing children with a group experience as one of their top three reasons for a society to have preschools. Sixty-two percent of the more individually oriented (强调个性发展的) Americans listed group experience as one of their top three choices. An emphasis on the importance of the group seen in Japanese early childhood education continues into elementary school education.
Like in America, there is diversity in Japanese early childhood education. Some Japanese kindergartens have specific aims, such as early musical training or potential development. In large cities, some kindergartens are attached to universities that have elementary and secondary schools. Some Japanese parents believe that if their young children attend a university-based program, it will increase the children’s chances of eventually being admitted to top-rated schools and universities. Several more progressive programs have introduced free play as a way out for the heavy intellectualizing in some Japanese kindergartens.
16.	We learn from the first paragraph that many Americans believe ________.
A) Japanese parents are more involved in preschool education than American parents
B) Japan’s economic success is a result of its scientific achievements
C) Japanese preschool education emphasizes academic instruction
D) Japan’s higher education is superior to theirs
17.	Most Americans surveyed believe that preschools should also attach importance to ________.
A) problem solving
B) group experience
C) parental guidance
D) individually-oriented development
18.	In Japan’s preschool education, the focus is on ________.
A) preparing children academically
B) developing children’s artistic interests
C) tapping children’s potential
D) shaping children’s character
19.	Free play has been introduced in some Japanese kindergartens in order to ________.
A) broaden children’s horizon
B) cultivate children’s creativity
C) lighten children’s study load
D) enrich children’s knowledge
20.	Why do some Japanese parents send their children to university-based kindergartens?
A) They can do better in their future studies.
B) They can accumulate more group experience there.
C) They can be individually oriented when they grow up.
D) They can have better chances of getting a first-rate education.
Passage Three
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Lead deposits, which accumulated in soil and snow during the 1960’s and 70’s, were primarily the result of leaded gasoline emissions originating in the United States. In the twenty years that the Clean Air Act has mandated unleaded gas use in the United States, the lead accumulation worldwide has decreased significantly.
A study published recently in the journal Nature shows that air-borne leaded gas emissions from the United States were the leading contributor to the high concentration of lead in the snow in Greenland. The new study is a result of the continued research led by Dr. Charles Boutron, an expert on the impact of heavy metals on the environment at the National Center for Scientific Research in France. A study by Dr. Boutron published in 1991 showed that lead levels in arctic (北极的) snow were declining.
In his new study, Dr. Boutron found the ratios of the different forms of lead in the leaded gasoline used in the United States were different from the ratios of European, Asian and Canadian gasolines and thus enabled scientists to differentiate (区分) the lead sources. The dominant lead ratio found in Greenland snow matched that found in gasoline from the United States.
In a study published in the journal Ambio, scientists found that lead levels in soil in the Northeastern United States had decreased markedly since the introduction of unleaded gasoline.
Many scientists had believed that the lead would stay in soil and snow for a longer period.
The authors of the Ambio study examined samples of the upper layers of soil taken from the same sites of 30 forest floors in New England, New York and Pennsylvania in 1980 and in 1990. The forest environment processed and redistributed the lead faster than the scientists had expected.
Scientists say both studies demonstrate that certain parts of the ecosystem (生态系统) respond rapidly to reductions in atmospheric pollution, but that these findings should not be used as a license to pollute.
21.	The study published in the journal Nature indicates that ________.
A) the Clean Air Act has not produced the desired results
B) lead deposits in arctic snow are on the increase
C) lead will stay in soil and snow longer than expected
D) the US is the major source of lead pollution in arctic snow
22.	Lead accumulation worldwide decreased significantly after the use of unleaded gas in the US ________.
A) was discouraged
B) was enforced by law
C) was prohibited by law
D) was introduced
23.	How did scientists discover the source of lead pollution in Greenland?
A) By analyzing the data published in journals like Nature and Ambio.
B) By observing the lead accumulations in different parts of the arctic area.
C) By studying the chemical elements of soil and snow in Northeastern America.
D) By comparing the chemical compositions of leaded gasoline used in various countries.
24.	The authors of the Ambio study have found that ________.
A) forests get rid of lead pollution faster than expected
B) lead accumulations in forests are more difficult to deal with
C) lead deposits are widely distributed in the forests of the US
D) the upper layers of soil in forests are easily polluted by lead emissions
25.	It can be inferred from the last paragraph that scientists ________.
A) are puzzled by the mystery of forest pollution
B) feel relieved by the use of unleaded gasoline
C) still consider lead pollution a problem
D) lack sufficient means to combat lead pollution
Passage Four
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Exercise is one of the few factors with a positive role in long-term maintenance of body weight. Unfortunately, that message has not gotten through to the average American, who would rather try switching to “light” beer and low-calorie bread than increase physical exertion. The Centers for Disease Control, for example, found that fewer than one-fourth of overweight adults who were trying to shed pounds said they were combining exercise with their diet.
In rejecting exercise, some people may be discouraged too much by caloric-expenditure charts: for example, one would have to briskly walk three miles just to work off the 275 calories in one delicious Danish pastry (小甜饼). Even exercise professionals concede half a point here. “Exercise by itself is a very tough way to lose weight,” says York Onnen, program director of the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.
Still, exercise’s supporting role in weight reduction is vital. A study at the Boston University Medical Center of overweight police officers and other public employees confirmed that those who dieted without exercise regained almost all their old weight, while those who worked exercise into their daily routine maintained their new weight.
If you have been sedentary (极少活动的) and decide to start walking one mile a day, the added exercise could burn an extra 100 calories daily. In a year’s time, assuming no increase in food intake, you could lose ten pounds. By increasing the distance of your walks gradually and making other dietary adjustments, you may lose even more weight.
26.	What is said about the average American in the passage?
A) They tend to exaggerate the healthful effect of “light” beer.
B) They usually ignore the effect of exercise on losing weight.
C) They prefer “light” beer and low-calorie bread to other drinks and food.
D) They know the factors that play a positive role in keeping down body weight.
27.	Some people dislike exercise because ________.
A) they think it is physically exhausting
B) they find it hard to exercise while on a diet
C) they don’t think it possible to walk 3 miles every day
D) they find consulting caloric-expenditure charts troublesome
28.	“Even exercise professionals concede half a point here” (Line 3, Para. 2) means “They ________”.
A) agree that the calories in a small piece of pastry can be difficult to work off by exercise
B) partially believe diet plays a supporting role in weight reduction
C) are not fully convinced that dieting can help maintain one’s new weight
D) are not sufficiently informed of the positive role of exercise in losing weight
29.	What was confirmed by the Boston University Medical Center’s study?
A) Controlling one’s calorie intake is more important than doing exercise.
B) Even occasional exercise can help reduce weight.
C) Weight reduction is impossible without exercise.
D) One could lose ten pounds in a year’s time if there’s no increase in food intake.
30.	What is the author’s purpose in writing this article?
A) To justify the study of the Boston University Medical Center.
B) To stress the importance of maintaining proper weight.
C) To support the statement made by York Onnen.
D) To show the most effective way to lose weight.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Passage 1
Is there enough oil beneath the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (保护区) (ANWR) to help secure America’s energy future? President Bush certainly thinks so. He has argued that tapping ANWR’s oil would help ease California’s electricity crisis and provide a major boost to the country’s energy independence. But no one knows for sure how much crude oil lies buried beneath the frozen earth with the last government survey, conducted in 1998, projecting output anywhere from 3 billion to 16 billion barrels.
The oil industry goes with the high end of the range, which could equal as much as 10% of U.S. consumption for as long as six years. By pumping more than 1 million barrels a day from the reserve for the next two three decades, lobbyists claim, the nation could cut back on imports equivalent to all shipments to the U.S. from Saudi Arabia. Sounds good. An oil boom would also mean a multibillion-dollar windfall (意外之财) in tax revenues, royalties (开采权使用费) and leasing fees for Alaska and the Federal Government. Best of all, advocates of drilling say, damage to the environment would be insignificant. “We’ve never had a document case of oil rig chasing deer out onto the pack ice.” says Alaska State Representative Scott Ogan.
Not so far, say environmentalists. Sticking to the low end of government estimates, the National Resources Defense Council says there may be no more than 3.2 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil in the coastal plain of ANWR, a drop in the bucket that would do virtually nothing to ease America’s energy problems. And consumers would wait up to a decade to gain any benefits, because drilling could begin only after much bargaining over leases, environmental permits and regulatory review. As for ANWR’s impact on the California power crisis, environmentalists point out that oil is responsible for only 1% of the Golden State’s electricity output—and just 3% of the nation’s.
21.	What does President Bush think of tapping oil in ANWR?
A) It will exhaust the nation’s oil reserves.
B) It will help secure the future of ANWR.
C) It will help reduce the nation’s oil imports.
D) It will increase America’s energy consumption.
22.	We learn from the second paragraph that the American oil industry ________.
A) believes that drilling for oil in ANWR will produce high yields
B) tends to exaggerate America’s reliance on foreign oil
C) shows little interest in tapping oil in ANWR
D) expects to stop oil imports from Saudi Arabia
23.	Those against oil drilling in ANWR argue that ________.
A) it can cause serious damage to the environment
B) it can do little to solve U.S. energy problems
C) it will drain the oil reserves in the Alaskan region
D) it will not have much commercial value
24.	What do the environmentalists mean by saying “Not so fast” (Line 1, Para. 3)?
A) Oil exploitation takes a long time
B) The oil drilling should be delayed
C) Don’t be too optimistic
D) Don’t expect fast returns
25.	It can be learned from the passage that oil exploitation beneath ANWR’s frozen earth ________.
A) remains a controversial issue
B) is expected to get under way soon
C) involves a lot of technological problems
D) will enable the U.S. to be oil independent
Passage 2
“Tear ‘em apart!” “Kill the fool!” “Murder the referee (裁判)!”
These are common remarks one may hear at various sporting events. At the time they are made, they may seem innocent enough. But let’s not kid ourselves. They have been known to influence behavior in such a way as to lead to real bloodshed. Volumes have been written about the way words affect us. It has been shown that words having certain connotations (含义) may cause us to react in ways quite foreign to what we consider to be our usual humanistic behavior. I see the term “opponent” as one of those words. Perhaps the time has come to delete it from sports terms.
The dictionary meaning of the term “opponent “is “adversary “: “enemy “; “one who opposes your interests.” “Thus, when a player meets an opponent, he or she may tend to treat that opponent as an enemy. At such times, winning may dominate one’s intellect, and every action, no matter how gross, may be considered justifiable. I recall an incident in a handball game when a referee refused a player’s request for a time out for a glove change because he did not considered then wet enough. The player proceeded to rub his gloves across his wet T-shirt and then exclaimed. “Are they wet enough now?”
In the heat of battle, players have been observed to throw themselves across the court without considering the consequences that such a move might have on anyone in their way. I have also witnessed a player reacting to his opponent’s international and illegal blocking by deliberately hitting him with the ball as hard as he could during the course of play. Off the court, they are good friends. Does that make any sense? It certainly gives proof of a court attitude which departs from normal behavior.
Therefore, I believe it is time we elevated (提升) the game to the level where it belongs thereby setting an example to the rest of the sporting world. Replacing the term “opponent” with “associate” could be an ideal way to start.
The dictionary meaning of the term “associate” is “colleague”; “friend”; “companion.” Reflect a moment! You may soon see and possibly feel the difference in your reaction to the term “associate” rather than “opponent.”
26.	Which of the following statements best expresses the author’s view?
A) Aggressive behavior in sports can have serious consequences.
B) The words people use can influence their behavior.
C) Unpleasant words in sports are often used by foreign athletes.
D) Unfair judgments by referees will lead to violence on the sports field.
27.	Harsh words are spoken during games because the players ________.
A) are too eager to win

A) He refused to continue the game.
B) He angrily hit the referee with a ball.
C) He claimed that the referee was unfair.
D) He wet his gloves by rubbing them across his T-shirt.
29.	According to the passage, players, in a game, may ________.
A) deliberately throw the ball at anyone illegally blocking their way

Passage 3
Consumers are being confused and misled by the hodge-podge (大杂烩) of environmental claims made by household products, according to a “green labeling” study published by Consumers International Friday.
Among the report’s more outrageous (令人无法容忍的) findings-a German fertilizer described itself as “earthworm friendly” a brand of flour said it was “non-polluting” and a British toilet paper claimed to be “environmentally friendlier”
The study was written and researched by Britain’s National Consumer Council (NCC) for lobby group Consumer International. It was funded by the German and Dutch governments and the European Commission.
“ While many good and useful claims are being made, it is clear there is a long way to go in ensuring shoppers are adequately informed about the environmental impact of products they buy,” said Consumers International director Anna Fielder.
The 10-country study surveyed product packaging in Britain, Western Europe, Scandinavia and the United States. It found that products sold in Germany and the United Kingdom made the most environmental claims on average.
The report focused on claims made by specific products, such as detergent (洗涤剂) insect sprays and by some garden products. It did not test the claims, but compared them to labeling guidelines set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in September, 1999.
Researchers documented claims of environmental friendliness made by about 2,000 products and found many too vague or too misleading to meet ISO standards.
“Many products had specially-designed labels to make them seem environmentally friendly, but in fact many of these symbols mean nothing,” said report researcher Philip Page.
“Laundry detergents made the most number of claims with 158. Household cleaners were second with 145 separate claims, while paints were third on our list with 73. The high numbers show how very confusing it must be for consumers to sort the true from the misleading.” he said.
The ISO labeling standards ban vague or misleading claims on product packaging, because terms such as “environmentally friendly” and “non-polluting” cannot be verified. “What we are now pushing for is to have multinational corporations meet the standards set by the ISO.” said Page.
31.	According to the passage, the NCC found it outrageous that ________.
A) all the products surveyed claim to meet ISO standards
B) the claims made by products are often unclear or deceiving
C) consumers would believe many of the manufactures’ claim
D) few products actually prove to be environment friendly
32.	As indicated in this passage, with so many good claims, the consumers ________.
A) are becoming more cautious about the products they are going to buy
B) are still not willing to pay more for products with green labeling
C) are becoming more aware of the effects different products have on the environment
D) still do not know the exact impact of different products on the environment
33.	A study was carried out by Britain’s NCC to ________.
A) find out how many claims made by products fail to meet environmental standards
B) inform the consumers of the environmental impact of the products they buy
C) examine claims made by products against ISO standards
D) revise the guidelines set by the International Standards Organization
34.	What is one of the consequences caused by the many claims of household products?
A) They are likely to lead to serious environmental problems.
B) Consumers find it difficult to tell the true from the false.
C) They could arouse widespread anger among consumer.
D) Consumers will be tempted to buy products they don’t need.
35.	It can be inferred from the passage that the lobby group Consumer International wants to ________.
A) make product labeling satisfy ISO requirements
B) see all household products meet environmental standards
C) warn consumers of the danger of so-called green products
D) verify the efforts of non-polluting products
Passage 4
Two hours from the tall buildings of Manhattan and Philadelphia live some of the world’s largest black bears. They are in northern Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains, a home they share with an abundance of other wildlife.
The streams, lakes, meadows (草地), mountain ridges and forests that make the Poconos an ideal place for black bears have also attracted more people to the region. Open spaces are threatened by plans for housing estates and important habitats (栖息地) are endangered by highway construction. To protect the Poconos natural beauty from irresponsible development, the Nature Conservancy (大自然保护协会) named the area one of America’s “Last Great Places”.
Operating out of a century-old schoolhouse in the village of Long Pond, Pennsylvania, the conservancy’s bud Cook is working with local people and business leaders to balance economic growth with environmental protection. By forging partnerships with people like Francis Altemose, the Conservancy has been able to protect more than 14,000 acres of environmentally important land in the area.
Altemose’s family has farmed in the Pocono area for generations. Two years ago Francis worked with the Conservancy to include his farm in a county farmland protection program. As a result, his family’s land can be protected from development and the Altemoses will be better able to provide a secure financial future for their 7-year-old grandson.
Cook attributes the Conservancy’s success in the Poconos to having a local presence and a commitment to working with local residents
“The key to protecting these remarkable lands is connecting with the local community,” Cook said. “The people who live there respect the land. They value quiet forests, clear streams and abundant wildlife. They are eager to help with conservation effort.
For more information on how you can help the Nature Conservancy protect the Poconos and the world’s other “Last Great Places,” please call 1-888-564 6864 or visit us on the World Wide Web at www.tnc.org.

Part IV Short Answer Questions (15 minutes)
We commonly think of sportsmanship in connection with athletic contests, but it also applies to individual outdoor sports. Not everyone who picks up a fishing rod or goes out with a gun is a sportsman. The sportsman first of all obeys the fish and game laws, not because he is liable to be punished as a violator, but because he knows that in the main these laws are made for his best interests.
The following are some of the things that those who would qualify for membership in the sportsmanship fraternity (圈内人) will do.
1. Take no more game than the bag limit provided for by the fish and game laws. The person who comes back from a trip boasting about the large number of fish or game taken is not a sportsman but a game hog (贪得无厌的捕猎者).
2. Observe the unwritten rules of fair play. This means shooting game birds only when the birds are “on the wing”. For the same reason, do not use a shotgun to shoot a rabbit or similar animal while it is sitting or standing still.
3. Be careful in removing illegal or undersized fish from the hook. This should be done only after wetting the hands. This is necessary because the body of the fish is covered with a thin, protective film which will stick to your dry hands. If the hands are dry when the fish is handled, the film is torn from the body of the fish. Without the protective film, the fish is more easily attacked by diseases. If you wish to release a fish that is hooked in such a way that it will be impossible to be close to the hook as convenient. In a remarkably short time, the hook will break down and the fish will remain almost unharmed. Fish have been known to feed successfully while hooks were still in their lips.
4. Be sure of the identity of your target before you shoot. Many useful and harmless species of wildlife are thoughtlessly killed by the uninformed person who is out with a gun to kill whatever flies within range.
S1.	In what respect does the author think individual outdoor sports are similar to athletic contests?
S2.	A person who goes out fishing with a fishing rod or hunting with a gun is not necessarily ________.
S3.	What’s the most important thing a true sportsman should bear in mind when he goes fishing or hunting ________.
S4.	Those who violate the fish and game laws will not be ________ for membership in the sportsmanship fraternity.
S5.	What are people called when they break the bag limit and boast about their big catch?
S6.	A true sportsman will not shoot an animal which is not ________.
S7.	What are people advised to do before they remove illegal or undersized fish from the hook?
S8.	What should sportsman do to avoid killing rare species of wildlife?

Part II Reading comprehension (35 minutes)
Passage One
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Just five one-hundredths of an inch thick, light golden in color and with a perfect “saddle curl,” the Lay’s potato chip seems an unlikely weapon for global domination. But its maker. Frito-Lay. Thinks otherwise. “Potato chips are a snack food for the world,” said Salman Amin, the company’s head of global marketing. Amin believes there is no corner of the world that can resist the charms of a Frito-Lay potato chip.
Frito-Lay is the biggest snack maker in America, owned by PepsiCo. And accounts for over half of the parent company’s $3 billion annual profits. But the U.S. snack food market is largely saturated, and to grow, the company has to look overseas.
Its strategy rests on two beliefs: first a global product offers economies of scale with which local brands cannot compete. And second, consumers in the 21st century are drawn to “global” as a concept. “Global” does not mean products that are consciously identified as American, but ones than consumes-especially young people-see as part of a modem, innovative (创新的) world in which people are linked across cultures by shared beliefs and tastes. Potato chips are an American invention, but most Chinese, for instance, do not know than Frito-Lay is an American company. Instead, Riskey, the company’s research and development head, would hope they associate the brand with the new world of global communications and business.
With brand perception a crucial factor, Riskey ordered a redesign of the Frito-Lay logo (标识). The logo, along with the company’s long-held marketing image of the “irresistibility” of its chips, would help facilitate the company’s global expansion.
The executives acknowledge that they try to swing national eating habits to a food created in America, but they deny that amounts to economic imperialism. Rater, they see Frito-Lay as spreading the benefits of free enterprise across the world. “We’re making products in those countries, we’re adapting them to the tastes of those countries, building businesses and employing people and changing lives,” said Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo’s chief executive.
21.	It is the belief of Frito-Lay’s head of global marking that ________.
A) potato chips can hardly be used as a weapon to dominate the world market
B) their company must find new ways to promote domestic sales
C) the light golden color enhances the charm of their company’s potato chips
D) people the world over enjoy eating their company’s potato chips
22.	What do we learn about Frito-Lay from Paragraph 2?
A) Its products use to be popular among overseas consumers.
B) Its expansion has caused fierce competition in the snack marker.
C) It gives half of its annual profits to its parent company.
D) It needs to turn to the word market for development.
23.	One of the assumptions on which Frito-Lay bases its development strategy is that ________.
A) consumers worldwide today are attracted by global brands
B) local brands cannot compete successfully with American brands
C) products suiting Chinese consumers’ needs bring more profits
D) products identified as American will have promising market value
24.	Why did Riskey have the Frito-Lay logo redesigned?
A) To suit changing tastes of young consumers.
B) To promote the company’s strategy of globalization.
C) To change the company’s long-held marketing image.
D) To compete with other American chip producers.
25.	Frito-Lay’s executives claim that the promoting of American food in the international market ________.
A) won’t affect the eating habits of the local people
B) will lead to economic imperialism
C) will be in the interest of the local people
D) won’t spoil the taste of their chips
Passage Two
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
In communities north of Denver, residents are pitching in to help teachers and administrators as the Vrain school District tries to solve a $13.8 million budget shortage blamed on mismanagement. “We’re worried about our teachers and principals, and we really don’t want to lose them because of this,” one parent sail. “If we can help ease their financial burden, we will. “
Teachers are grateful, but know it may be years before the district is solvent (有综合能力的). They feel really good about the parent support, but they realize it’s impossible for then to solve this problem.
The 22,000-student district discovered the shortage last month. “It’s extraordinary. Nobody would have imagined something happening like this at this level,” said State Treasurer Mike Coffman.
Coffman and district officials last week agreed on a state emergency plan freeing yp a $9.8 million loan that enabled the payroll (工资单) to be met for 2,700 teachers and staff in time for the holidays.
District officials also took $1.7 million from student-activity accounts its 38 schools.
At Coffman’s request, the District Attorney has begun investigating the district’s finances. Coffman says he wants to know whether district officials hid the budget shortage until after the November election, when voters approved a $212 million bond issue for schools.
In Frederick, students’ parents are buying classroom supplies and offering to pay for groceries and utilities to keep first-year teachers and principals in their jobs.
Some $36,000 has been raised in donations from Safeway. A Chevrolet dealership donated $10,000 and forgave the district’s $10,750 bill for renting the driver educating cars. IBM contributed 4,500 packs of paper.
“We employ thousands of people in this community,” said Mitch Carson, a hospital chief executive, who helped raise funds. “We have children in the school, and we see how they could be affected.”
At Creek High School, three students started a website that displays newspaper articles, district information and an email forum (论坛)。 “Rumors about what’s happening to the district are moving at lighting speed,” said a student. “We wanted to know the truth, and spread that around instead.”
26.	What has happened to the Vrain School District?
A) A huge financial problem has arisen.
B) Many schools there are mismanaged.
C) Lots of teachers in the district are planning to quit.
D) Many administrative personnel have been laid off.
27.	How did the residents in the Vrain School District respond to the budget shortage?
A) They felt somewhat helpless about it.
B) They accused those responsible for it.
C) They pooled their efforts to help solve it.
D) They demanded a through investigation.
28.	In the view of State Treasurer Mike Coffman, the educational budget shortage is ________.

Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
“Humans should not try to avoid stress any more than they would shun food, love or exercise.” Said Dr. Hans Selye, the first physician to document the effects of stress on the body. While here’s on question that continuous stress is harmful, several studies suggest that challenging situations in which you’re able to rise to the occasion can be good for you.
In a 2001 study of 158 hospital nurses, those who faced considerable work demands but coped with the challenge were more likely to say they were in good health than those who felt they stress that you can manage also boost immune (免疫的) function. In a study at the Academic Center for Dentistry in Amsterdam, researchers put volunteers through two stressful experiences. In the first, a timed task that required memorizing a list followed by a short test, subjects through a gory (血淋淋的) video on surgical procedures. Those who did well on the memory test had an increase in levels of immunoglobulin A, an antibody that’s the body’s first line of defense against germs. The video-watchers experienced a downturn in the antibody.
Stress prompts the body to produce certain stress hormones. In short bursts these hormones have a positive effect, including improved memory function. “They can help nerve cells handle information and put it into storage,” says Dr. Bruce McEwen of Rockefeller University in New York. But in the long run these hormones can have a harmful effect on the body and brain.
“Sustained stress is not good for you,” says Richard Morimoto, a researcher at Northwestern University in Illinois studying the effects of stress on longevity, “It’s the occasional burst of stress or brief exposure to stress that could be protective.”

A) people under stress tend to have a poor memory
B) people who can’t get their job done experience more stress
C) doing challenging work may be good for one’s health
D) stress will weaken the body’s defense against germs
34.	In the experiment described in Paragraph 3, the video-watchers experienced a downturn in the antibody because ________.
A) the video was not enjoyable at all
B) the outcome was beyond their control
C) they knew little about surgical procedures
D) they felt no pressure while watching the video
35.	Dr. Bruce McEwen of Rockefeller University believes that ________.
A) a person’s memory is determined by the level of hormones in his body
B) stress hormones have lasting positive effects on the brain
C) short bursts of stress hormones enhance memory function
D) a person’s memory improves with continued experience of stress
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
If you want to teach your children how to say sorry, you must be good at saying it yourself, especially to your own children. But how you say it can be quite tricky.
If you say to your children “I’m sorry I got angry with you, but ...” what follows that “but” can render the apology ineffective: “I had a bad day” or “your noise was giving me a headache” leaves the person who has been injured feeling that he should be apologizing for his bad behavior in expecting an apology.
Another method by which people appear to apologize without actually doing so is to say “I’m sorry you’re upset”; this suggests that you are somehow at fault for allowing yourself to get upset by what the other person has done.
Then there is the general, all covering apology, which avoids the necessity of identifying a specific act that was particularly hurtful or insulting, and which the person who is apologizing should promise never to do again. Saying “I’m useless as a parent” does not commit a person to any specific improvement.
These pseudo-apologies are used by people who believe saying sorry shows weakness, Parents who wish to teach their children to apologize should see it as a sign of strength, and therefore not resort to these pseudo-apologies.
But even when presented with examples of genuine contrition, children still need help to become a ware of the complexities of saying sorry. A three-year-old might need help in understanding that other children feel pain just as he does, and that hitting a playmate over the head with a heavy toy requires an apology. A six-year-old might need reminding that spoiling other children’s expectations can require an apology. A 12-year-old might need to be shown that raiding the biscuit tin without asking permission is acceptable, but that borrowing a parent’s clothes without permission is not.
36.	If a mother adds “but” to an apology, ________.
A) she doesn’t feel that she should have apologized
B) she does not realize that the child has been hurt
C) the child may find the apology easier to accept
D) the child may feel that he owes her an apology
37.	According to the author, saying “I’m sorry you’re upset” most probably means “________”.
A) You have good reason to get upset
B) I’m aware you’re upset, but I’m not to blame
C) I apologize for hurting your feelings
D) I’m at fault for making you upset
38.	It is not advisable to use the general, all-covering apology because ________.
A) it gets one into the habit of making empty promises
B) it may make the other person feel guilty
C) it is vague and ineffective
D) it is hurtful and insulting
39.	We learn from the last paragraph that in teaching children to say sorry ________.
A) the complexities involved should be ignored
B) their ages should be taken into account
C) parents need to set them a good example
D) parents should be patient and tolerant
40.	It can be inferred from the passage that apologizing properly is ________.
A) a social issue calling for immediate attention
B) not necessary among family members

Highways
Early in the 20th century, most of the streets and roads in the U.S. were made of dirt, brick, and cedar wood blocks. Built for horse, carriage, and foot traffic, they were usually poorly cared for and too narrow to accommodate (容纳) automobiles.
With the increase in auto production, private turnpike (收费公路) companies under local authorities began to spring up, and by 1921 there were 387,000 miles of paved roads. Many were built using specifications of 19th century Scottish engineers Thomas Telford and John MacAdam (for whom the macadam surface is named), whose specifications stressed the importance of adequate drainage. Beyond that, there were no national standards for size, weight restrictions, or commercial signs. During World War I, roads throughout the country were nearly destroyed by the weight of trucks. When General Eisenhower returned from Germany in 1919, after serving in the U.S. army’s first transcontinental motor convoy (车队), he noted: “The old convoy had started me thinking about good, two-lane highways, but Germany’s Autobahn or motorway had made me see the wisdom of broader ribbons across the land.”
It would take another war before the federal government would act on a national highway system. During World War II, a tremendous increase in trucks and new roads were required. The war demonstrated how critical highways were to the defense effort. Thirteen per cent of defense plants received all their supplies by truck, and almost all other plants shipped more than half of their products by vehicle. The war also revealed that local control of highways had led to a confusing variety of design standards. Even federal and state highways did not follow basic standards. Some states allowed trucks up to 36,000 pounds, while others restricted anything over 7,000 pounds.
A government study recommended a national highway system of 33,920 miles, and congress soon passed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944, which called for strict, centrally controlled design criteria.
The interstate highway system was finally launched in 1956 and has been hailed as one of the greatest public works projects of the century. To build its 44,000-mile web of highways, bridge, and tunnels, hundreds of unique engineering designs and solutions had to be worked out. Consider the many geographic features of the country: mountains, steep grades, wetlands, rivers, deserts and plains. Variables included the slope of the land, the ability of the pavement to support the load, the intensity of road use, and the nature of the underlying soil. Urban areas were another problem. Innovative designs of roadways, tunnels, bridges, overpasses, and interchanges that could run through or bypass urban areas soon began to weave their way across the country, forever altering the face of America.
Today, the interstate system links every major city in the U.S., and the U.S. with Canada and Mexico. Built with safety in mind, the highways have wide lanes and shoulders, dividing medians, or barriers, long entry and exit lanes, curves engineered for safe turns, and limited access. The death rate on highways is half that of all other U.S. roads (0.86 deaths per 100 million passenger miles compared to 1.99 deaths per 100 million on all other roads).
By opening the North American continent, highways have enabled consumer goods and services to reach people in remote and rural areas of the country, spurred the growth of suburbs, and provided people with greater options in term of jobs, access to cultural programs, health care, and other benefits. Above all, the interstate system provides individuals with what they cherish most: personal freedom of mobility.
The interstate system has been an essential element of the nation’s economic growth in terms of shipping and job creation: more than 75 percent of the nation’s freight deliveries arrive by truck; and most products that arrive by rail or air use interstates for the last leg of the journey by vehicle. Not only has the highway system affected the American economy by providing shipping routes, it has led to the growth of spin-off industries like service stations, motels, restaurants, and shopping centers. It has allowed the relocation of manufacturing plants and other industries from urban areas to rural.
By the end of the century there was an immense network of paved roads, residential streets, expressways, and freeways built to support millions of vehicles. The highway system was officially renamed for Eisenhower to honor his vision and leadership. The year construction began he said: “Together, the united forces of our communication and transportation systems are dynamic elements in the very name we bear—United States. Without them, we would be a mere alliance of many separate parts.”

The warming of the ocean has far-reaching effects. The hot, humid (潮湿的) air over the ocean causes severe __49__ thunderstorms. The rainfall is increased across South America. __50__ floods to Peru. In the West pacific, there are droughts affecting Australia and Indonesia. So while some parts of the world prepare for heavy rains and floods, other parts face drought, poor crops and __51__.
El Nino usually lasts for about 18 months. The 1982-83 El Nino brought the most __52__ weather in modern history. Its effect was worldwide and it left more than 2,000 people dead and caused over eight billion pounds __53__ of damage. The 1990 El Nino lasted until June 1995.

Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
Communications technologies are far from equal when it comes to conveying the truth. The first study to compare honesty across a range of communication media has fund that people are twice as likely to tell lies in phone conversations as they are in emails. The fact that emails are automatically recorded—and can come back to haunt (困扰) you—appears to be the key to the finding.
Jeff Hancock of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, asked 30 students to keep a communications diary for a week. In it they noted the number of conversations or email exchanges they had lasting more than 10 minutes, and confessed to how many lies they told. Hancock then worked out the number of lies per conversation for each medium. He found that lies made up 14 per cent of emails, 21 per cent of instant messages, 27 per cent of face-to-face interactions and an astonishing 37 per cent of phone calls.
His results to be presented at the conference on human-computer interaction in Vienna, Austria, in April, have surprised psychologists. Some expected emailers to be the biggest liars, reasoning that because deception makes people uncomfortable, the detachment (非直接接触) of emailing would make it easier to lie. Others expected people to lie more in face-to-face exchanges because we are most practised at that form of communication.
But Hancock says it is also crucial whether a conversation is being recorded and could be reread, and whether it occurs in real time. People appear to be afraid to lie when they know the communication could later be used to hold them to account, he says. This is why fewer lies appear in email than on the phone.
People are also more likely to lie in real time—in a instant message or phone call, say—than if they have time to think of a response, says Hancock. He found many lies are spontaneous (脱口而出的) responses to an unexpected demand, such as: “Do you like my dress?”
Hancock hopes his research will help companies work our the best ways for their employees to communicate. For instance, the phone might be the best medium foe sales where employees are encouraged to stretch the truth. But, given his result, work assessment where honesty is a priority, might be best done using email.

Passage Two
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
In a country that defines itself by ideals, not by shared blood, who should be allowed to come work and live here? In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks these questions have never seemed more pressing.
On Dec. 11, 2001, as part of the effort to increase homeland security, federal and local authorities in 14 states staged “Operation Safe Travel”—raids on airports to arrest employees with false identification (身份证明). In Salt Lake City there were 69 arrests. But those captured were anything but terrorists, most of them illegal immigrants from Central or South America. Authorities said the undocumented workers’ illegal status made them open to blackmail (讹诈) by terrorists.
Many immigrants in Salt Lake City were angered by the arrests and said they felt as if they were being treated like disposable goods.
Mayor Anderson said those feelings were justified to a certain extent. “We’re saying we want you to work in these places, we’re going to look the other way in terms of what our laws are, and then when it’s convenient for us, or when we can try to make a point in terms of national security, especially after Sept. 11, then you’re disposable. There are whole families being uprooted for all of the wrong reasons,” Anderson said.
If Sept. 11 had never happened, the airport workers would not have been arrested and could have gone on quietly living in America, probably indefinitely. Ana Castro, a manager at a Ben & Jerry’s ice cream shop at the airport had been working 10 years with the same false Social Security card when she was arrested in the December airport raid. Now she and her family are living under the threat of deportation (驱逐出境). Castro’s case is currently waiting to be settled. While she awaits the outcome, the government has granted her permission to work here and she has returned to her job at Ben & Jerry’s.
62.	According to the author, the United States claims to be a nation ________.
A) composed of people having different values
B) encouraging individual pursuits
C) sharing common interests
D) founded on shared ideals
63.	How did the immigrants in Salt Lake City feel about “Operation Safe Travel”?
A) Guilty.
B) Offended.
C) Disappointed.
D) Discouraged.
64.	Undocumented workers became the target of “Operation Safe Travel” because ________.
A) evidence was found that they were potential terrorists
B) most of them worked at airports under threat of terrorists
C) terrorists might take advantage of their illegal status
D) they were reportedly helping hide terrorists around the airport
65.	By saying “... we’re going to look the other way in terms of what our laws are” (Line 2, Para. 4), Mayor Anderson means “________”.
A) we will turn a blind eye to your illegal status
B) we will examine the laws in a different way
C) there are other ways of enforcing the law
D) the existing laws must not be ignored
66.	What do we learn about Ana Castro from the last paragraph?
A) She will be deported sooner or later.
B) She is allowed to stay permanently.
C) Her case has been dropped.
D) Her fate remains uncertain.

Part II Reading Comprehension (35 minutes)
Passage one
Directions:	There are 4 passages in this part, Each passage is followed by some questions at unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the center.
Questions 21 to 25 are based on the following passage.
Interest in pursuing international careers has soared in recent years, enhanced by chronic (长久的) personnel shortages that are causing companies to search beyond their home borders for talent.
Professionals seek career experience outside of their home countries for a variety of reasons. They may feel the need to recharge their batteries with a new challenge. They may want a position with more responsibility that encourages creativity and initiative. Or they may wish to expose their children to another culture, and the opportunity to learn a second language.
When applying for a job, one usually has to submit a resume or curriculum vitae (CV). The two terms generally mean the same thing: a one-or two-page document describing one’s educational qualifications and professional experience. However, guidelines for preparing a resume are constantly changing. The best advice is to find out what is appropriate regarding the corporate (公司) culture, the country culture, and the culture of the person making the hiring decision. The challenge will be to embrace two or more cultures in one document. The following list is a good place to start.
● “Educational requirements differ from country to country. In almost every case of ‘cross-border’ job hunting, just stating the title of your degree will not bean adequate description. Provide the reader with details about your studies and any related experience.”
● Pay attention to the resume format you use-chronological or reverse-chronological order. Chronological order means listing your ‘oldest’ work experience first. Reverse-chronological order means listing your current or most recent experience first. Most countries have preferences about which format is most acceptable. If you find no specific guidelines, the general preference is for the reverse-chronological format.”
● If you are submitting your resume in English, find out if the recipient (收件人) uses British English or American English because there are variations between the two versions. For example, university education is often referred to as ‘tertiary education’ in the United Kingdom, but this term is almost never used in the United States. A reader who is unfamiliar with these variations may assume that your resume contains errors.
21.	Companies are hiring more foreign employees because ________.
A) they find foreign employees are usually more talented
B) they need original ideas from employees hired overseas
C) they want to expand their business beyond home borders
D) they have difficulty finding qualified personnel at home
22.	The author believes that an individual who applies to work overseas ________.
A) is usually creative and full of initiative
B) aims to improve his foreign language skills
C) is dissatisfied with his own life at home
D) seeks either his own or his children’s development
23.	When it comes to resume writing, it is best to ________.
A) take cultural factors into consideration
B) learn about the company’s hiring process
C) follow appropriate guidelines for job hunting
D) know the employer’s personal likes and dislikes
24.	When writing about qualifications, applicants are advised to ________.
A) stress their academic potential to impress the decision maker
B) give the title of the university degree they have earned at home
C) provide a detailed description of their study and work experiences
D) highlight their keen interest in pursuing a ‘cross-border’ career
25.	According to the author’s last piece of advice, the applicants should be aware of ________.
A) the different educational systems in the US and the UK
B) the differences between the varieties of English
C) the recipient’s preference with regard to the format
D) the distinctive features of American and British cultures
Questions 26 to 30 are based on the following passage.
Passage Two
Educating girls quite possibly yields a higher rate of return than any other investment available in the developing world. Women’s education may be unusual territory for economists, but enhancing women’s contribution to development is actually as much an economic as a social issue. And economics, with its emphasis on incentives (激励), provides guideposts that point to an explanation for why so many girls are deprived of an education.
Parents in low-income countries fail to invest in their daughters because they do not expect them to make an economic contribution to the family: girls grow up only to marry into somebody else’s family and bear children. Girls are thus seen as less valuable than boys and art kept at home to do housework while their brothers are sent to school-the prophecy (预言) becomes self-fulfilling, trapping women in a vicious circle (恶性循环) of neglect.
An educated mother, on the other hand, has greater earning abilities outside the home and faces an entirely different set of choices. She is likely to have fewer but healthier children and can insist on the development of all her children, ensuring that her daughters are given a fair chance. The education of her daughters then makes it much more likely that the next generation of girls, as well as of boys, will be educated and healthy. The vicious circle is thus transformed into a virtuous circle.
Few will dispute that educating women has great social benefits. But it has enormous economic advantages as well. Most obviously, there is the direct effect of education on the wages of female workers. Wages rise by 10 to 20 per cent for each additional year of schooling. Such big returns are impressive by the standard of other available investments, but they are just the beginning. Educating women also has a significant impact on health practices, including family planning.
26.	The author argues that educating girls in developing countries is ________.
A) troublesome
B) labor-saving
C) rewarding
D) expensive
27.	By saying “... the prophecy becomes self-fulfilling...” (Lines 45, Para. 2). the author means that ________.
A) girls will turn out to be less valuable than boys
B) girls will be capable of realizing their own dreams
C) girls will eventually find their goals in life beyond reach
D) girls will be increasingly discontented with their life at home
28.	The author believes that a vicious circle can turn into a virtuous circle when ________.
A) women care more about education
B) girls can gain equal access to education
C) a family has fewer but healthier children
D) parents can afford their daughters’ education
29.	What does the author say about women’s education?
A) It deserves greater attention than other social issues.
B) It is now given top priority in many developing countries.
C) It will yield greater returns than other known investments.
D) It has aroused the interest of a growing number of economists.
30.	The passage mainly discusses ________.
A) unequal treatment of boys and girls in developing countries
B) the potential earning power of well-educated women
C) the major contributions of educated women to society
D) the economic and social benefits of educating women
Passage Three
Questions 31 to 35 are based on the following passage.
Speeding off in a stolen car, the thief thinks he has got a great catch. But he is in for an unwelcome surprise. The car is fitted with a remote immobiliser (锁止器), and a radio signal from a control centre miles away will ensure that once the thief switches the engine off, he will not be able to start it again.
The idea goes like this. A control box fitted to the car contains a mini-cellphone, a micro-processor and memory, and a GPS (全球定位系统) satellite positioning receiver. If the car is stolen, a coded cellphone signal will tell the control centre to block the vehicle’s engine management system and prevent the engine being restarted.
In the UK, a set of technical fixes is already making life harder for car thieves. ‘The pattern of vehicle crime has changed,’ says Martyn Randall, a security expert. He says it would only take him a few minutes to teach a person how to steal a car, using a bare minimum of tools. But only if the car is more than 10 years old.
Modern cars are far tougher to steal, as their engine management computer won’t allow them to start unless they receive a unique ID code beamed out by the ignition (点火) key. In the UK, technologies like this have helped achieve a 31% drop in vehicle-related crime since 1997.
But determined criminals are still managing to find other ways to steal cars, often by getting bold of the owner’s keys. And key theft is responsible for 40% of the thefts of vehicles fitted with a tracking system.
If the car travels 100 metres without the driver confirming their ID, the system will send a signal to an operations centre that it has been stolen. The hundred metres minimum avoids false alarms due to inaccuracies in the GPS signal.
Staff at the centre will then contact the owner to confirm that the car really is missing, and keep police informed of the vehicle’s movements via the car’s GPS unit.
31.	What’s the function of the remote immobilizer fitted to a car?
A) To help the police make a surprise attack on the car thief.
B) To allow the car to lock automatically when stolen.
C) To prevent the car thief from restarting it once it stops.
D) To prevent car theft by sending a radio signal to the car owner.
32.	By saying “The pattern of vehicle crime has changed” (Lines 1-2. Para. 3), Martyn Randall suggests that ________.
A) it takes a longer time for the car thief to do the stealing
B) self-prepared tools are no longer enough for car theft
C) the thief has to make use of computer technology
D) the thief has lost interest in stealing cars over 10 years old
33.	What is essential in making a modem car tougher to steal?
A) A coded ignition key.
B) A unique ID card.
C) A special cellphone signal.
D) A GPS satellite positioning receiver.
34.	Why does the tracking system set a 100-metre minimum before sending an alarm to the operations centre?
A) To leave time for the operations centre to give an alarm.
B) To keep police informed of the car’s movements.
C) To give the driver time to contact the operations centre.
D) To allow for possible errors in the GPS system.
35.	What will the operations centre do first after receiving an alarm?
A) Start the tracking system.
B) Contact the car owner.
C) Block the car engine.
D) Locate the missing car.
Passage Four
Questions 36 to 40 are based on the following passage.
Psychiatrists (精神病专家) who work with older parents say that maturity can be an asset in child rearing-older parents are more thoughtful, use less physical discipline and spend more time with their children. But raising kids takes money and energy. Many older parents find themselves balancing their limited financial resources, declining energy and failing health against the growing demands of an active child. Dying and leaving young children is probably the older parents’ biggest, and often unspoken, fear. Having late-life children, says an economics professor, often means parents, particularly fathers, “end up retiring much later.” For many, retirement becomes an unobtainable dream.
Henry Metcalf, a 54-year-old journalist, knows it takes money to raise kids. But he’s also worried that his energy will give out first. Sure, he can still ride bikes with his athletic fifth grader, but he’s learned that young at heart doesn’t mean young. Lately he’s been taking afternoon naps (午睡) to keep up his energy. “My body is aging,” says Metcalf. “You can’t get away from that.”
Often, older parents hear the ticking of another kind of biological clock. Therapists who work with middle-aged and older parents say fears about aging are nothing to laugh at. “They worry they’ll be mistaken for grandparents, or that they’ll need help getting up out of those little chairs in nursery school,” says Joann Galst, a New York psychologist. But at the core of those little fears there is often a much bigger one: “that they won’t be alive long enough to support and protect their child,” she says.
Many late-life parents, though, say their children came at just the right time. After marrying late and undergoing years of fertility (受孕) treatment, Marilyn Nolen and her husband. Randy, had twins. “We both wanted children,” says Marilyn, who was 55 when she gave birth. The twins have given the couple what they desired for years, “a sense of family.” Kids of older dads are often smarter, happier and more sociable because their fathers are more involved in their lives. “The dads are older, more mature,” says Dr. Silber, “and more ready to focus on parenting.”
36.	Why do psychiatrists regard maturity as an asset in child rearing?
A) Older parents are often better prepared financially.
B) Older parents can take better care of their children.
C) Older parents are usually more experienced in bringing up their children.
D) Older parents can better balance their resources against children’s demands.

Six Secrets of High-Energy People
There’s an energy crisis in America, and it has nothing to do with fossil fuels. Millions of us get up each morning already weary over the day holds. “I just can’t get started,” people say. But it’s not physical energy that most of us lack. Sure, we could all use extra sleep and a better diet. But in truth, people are healthier today than at any time in history. I can almost guarantee that if you long for more energy, the problem is not with your body.
What you’re seeking is not physical energy. It’s emotional energy. Yet, sad to say, life sometimes seems designed to exhaust our supply. We work too hard. We have family obligations. We encounter emergencies and personal crises. No wonder so many of us suffer from emotional fatigue, a kind of utter exhaustion of the spirit.
And yet we all know people who are filled with joy, despite the unpleasant circumstances of their lives. Even as a child, I observed people who were poor, or disabled, or ill, but who nonetheless faced life with optimism and vigor. Consider Laura Hillenbrand, who despite an extremely weak body, wrote the best-seller Seabiscuit. Hillenbrand barely had enough physical energy to drag herself out of bed to write. But she was fueled by having a story she wanted to share. It was emotional energy that helped her succeed.
Unlike physical energy, which is finite and diminishes with age, emotional energy is unlimited and has nothing to do with genes or upbringing. So how do you get it? You can’t simply tell yourself to be positive. You must take action. Here are six practical strategies that work.
1. Do something new.
Very little that’s new occurs in our lives. The impact of this sameness on our emotional energy is gradual, but huge: It’s like a tire with a slow leak. You don’t notice it at first, but eventually you’ll get a flat. It’s up to you to plug the leak—even though there are always a dozen reasons to stay stuck in your dull routines of life. That’s where Maura, 36, a waitress, found herself a year ago.
Fortunately, Maura had a lifeline—a group of women friends who meet regularly to discuss their lives. Their lively discussions spurred Maura to make small but nevertheless life altering changes. She joined a gym in the next town. She changed her look with a short haircut and new black T-shirts. Eventually, Maura gathered the courage to quit her job and start her own business.
Here’s a challenge: If it’s something you wouldn’t ordinarily do, do it. Try a dish you’ve never eaten. Listen to music you’d ordinarily tune out. You’ll discover these small things add to your emotional energy.
2. Reclaim life’s meaning.
So many of my patients tell me that their lives used to have meaning, but that somewhere along the line things went stale.
The first step in solving this meaning shortage is to figure out what you really care about, and then do something about it. A case in point is Ivy, 57, a pioneer in investment banking. “I mistakenly believed that all the money I made would mean something,” she says. “But I feel lost, like a 22-year-old wondering what to do with her life.” Ivy’s solution? She started a program that shows Wall Streeters how to donate time and money to poor children. In the process, Ivy filled her life with meaning.
3. Put yourself in the fun zone.
Most of us grown-ups are seriously fun-deprived. High-energy people have the same day-to-day work as the rest of us, but they manage to find something enjoyable in every situation. A real estate broker I know keeps herself amused on the job by mentally redecorating the houses she shows to clients. “I love imagining what even the most run-down house could look like with a little tender loving care,” she says. “It’s a challenge—and the least desirable properties are usually the most fun.”
We all define fun differently, of course, but I can guarantee this: If you put just a bit of it into your day, you energy will increase quickly.
4. Bid farewell to guilt and regret.
Everyone’s past is filled with regrets that still cause pain. But from an emotional energy point of view, they are dead weights that keep us from moving forward. While they can’t merely be willed away, I do recommend you remind yourself that whatever happened is in the past, and nothing can change that. Holding on to the memory only allows the damage to continue into the present.
5. Make up your mind.
Say you’ve been thinking about cutting your hair short. Will it look stylish—or too extreme?
You endlessly think it over. Having the decision hanging over your head is a huge energy drain.
Every time you can’t decide, you burden yourself with alternatives. Quit thinking that you have to make the right decision; instead, make a choice and don’t look back.
6. Give to get.
Emotional energy has a kind of magical quality; the more you give, the more you get back. This is the difference between emotional and physical energy. With the latter, you have to get it to be able to give it. With the former, however, you get it by giving it.
Start by asking everyone you meet, “How are you?” as if you really want to know, then listen to the reply. Be the one who hears. Most of us also need to smile more often. If you don’t smile at the person you love first thing in the morning, you’re sucking energy out of your relationship. Finally, help another person—and make the help real, concrete. Give a massage (按摩) to someone you love, or cook her dinner. Then, expand the circle to work. Try asking yourself what you’d do if your goal were to be helpful rather than efficient.
After all, if it’s true that what goes around comes around, why not make sure that what’s circulating around you is the good stuff?

Formal language is different from informal language in several ways. First, formal language tends to be more polite. (44) ________________________________. For example, I might say to a friend or a family member “Close the door, please,” (45) ________________________________.
Another difference between formal and informal language is some of the vocabulary. (46) ________________________________. Let’s say that I really like soccer.

Part IV Reading Comprehension (reading in depth) (25 minutes)
Section A
Directions:	In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.
The flood of women into the job market boosted economic growth and changed U.S. society in many ways. Many in-home jobs that used to be done __47__ by women—ranging from family shopping to preparing meals to doing __48__ work—still need to be done by someone. Husbands and children now do some of these jobs, a __49__ that has changed the target market for many products. Or a working woman may face a crushing “poverty of time” and look for help elsewhere, creating opportunities for producers of frozen meals, child care centers, dry cleaners, financial services, and the like.
Although there is still a big wage __50__ between men and women, the income working women __51__ gives them new independence and buying power. For example, women now __52__ about half of all cars. Not long ago, many cars dealers __53__ women shoppers by ignoring them or suggesting that they come back with their husbands. Now car companies have realized that women are __54__ customers. It’s interesting that some leading Japanese car dealers were the first to __55__ pay attention to women customers. In Japan, fewer women have jobs or buy cars—the Japanese society is still very much male-oriented. Perhaps it was the __56__ contrast with Japanese society that prompted American firms to pay more attention to women buyers.

Section B
Directions:	There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
Reaching new peaks of popularity in North America is Iceberg Water, which is harvested from icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada.
Arthur von Wiesenberger, who carries the title Water Master, is one of the few water critics in North America. As a boy, he spent time in the larger cities of Italy, France and Switzerland, where bottled water is consumed daily. Even then, he kept a water journal, noting the brands he liked best. “My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water,” He says.
But is plain tap water all that bad? Not at all. In fact, New York’s municipal water for more than a century was called the champagne of tap water and until recently considered among the best in the world in terms of both taste and purity. Similarly, a magazine in England found that tap water from the Thames River tasted better than several leading brands of bottled water that were 400 times more expensive.
Nevertheless, soft-drink companies view bottled water as the next battle-ground for market share—this despite the fact that over 25 percent of bottled water comes from tap water: PepsiCo’s Aquafina and Coca-Cola’s Dasani are both purified tap water rather than spring water.
As diners thirst for leading brands, bottlers and restaurateurs salivate (垂涎) over the profits. A restaurant’s typical mark-up on wine is 100 to 150 percent, whereas on bottled water it’s often 300 to 500 percent. But since water is much cheaper than wine, and many of the fancier brands aren’t available in stores, most diners don’t notice or care.
As a result, some restaurants are turning up the pressure to sell bottled water. According to an article in The Street Journal, some of the more shameless tactics include placing attractive bottles on the table for a visual sell, listing brands on the menu without prices, and pouring bottled water without even asking the diners if they want it.

Passage Two
As we have seen, the focus of medical care in our society has been shifting from curing disease to preventing disease—especially in terms of changing our many unhealthy behaviors, such as poor eating habits, smoking, and failure to exercise. The line of thought involved in this shift can be pursued further. Imagine a person who is about the right weight, but does not eat very nutritious (有营养的) foods, who feels OK but exercises only occasionally, who goes to work every day, but is not an outstanding worker, who drinks a few beers at home most nights but does not drive while drunk, and who has no chest pains or abnormal blood counts, but sleeps a lot and often feels tired. This person is not ill. He may not even be at risk for any particular disease. But we can imagine that this person could be a lot healthier.
The field of medicine has not traditionally distinguished between someone who is merely “not ill” and someone who is in excellent health and pays attention to the body’s special needs. Both types have simply been called “well.” In recent years, however, some health specialists have begun to apply the terms “well” and “wellness” only to those who are actively striving to maintain and improve their health. People who are well are concerned with nutrition and exercise, and they make a point of monitoring their body’s condition. Most important, perhaps, people who are well take active responsibility for all matters related to their health. Even people who have a physical disease or handicap (缺陷) may be “well,” in this new sense, if they make an effort to maintain the best possible health they can in the face of their physical limitations. “Wellness” may perhaps best be viewed not as a state that people can achieve, but as an ideal that people can strive for. People who are well are likely to be better able to resist disease and to fight disease when it strikes. And by focusing attention on healthy ways of living, the concept of wellness can have a beneficial impact on the ways in which people face the challenges of daily life.
62.	Today medical care is placing more stress on ________.
A) keeping people in a healthy physical condition
B) monitoring patients’ body functions
C) removing people’s bad living habits
D) ensuring people’s psychological well-being
63.	In the first paragraph, people are reminded that ________.
A) good health is more than not being ill
B) drinking, even if not to excess, could be harmful
C) regular health checks are essential to keeping fit
D) prevention is more difficult than cure
64.	Traditionally, a person is considered “well” if he ________.
A) does not have any unhealthy living habits
B) does not have any physical handicaps
C) is able to handle his daily routines
D) is free from any kind of disease
65.	According to the author, the true meaning of “wellness” is for people ________.
A) to best satisfy their body’s special needs
B) to strive to maintain the best possible health
C) to meet the strictest standards of bodily health
D) to keep a proper balance between work and leisure
66.	According to what the author advocates, which of the following groups of people would be considered healthy?
A) People who have strong muscles as well as slim figures.
B) People who are not presently experiencing any symptoms of disease.
C) People who try to be as possible, regardless of their limitations.
D) People who can recover from illness even without seeking medical care.

Protect Your Privacy When Job-hunting Online
Identity theft and identity fraud are terms used to refer to all types of crime in which someone wrongfully obtains and uses another person’s personal data in some way that involves fraud or deception, typically for economic gain.
The numbers associated with identity theft are beginning to add up fast these days. A recent General Accounting Office report estimates that as many as 750,000 Americans are victims of identity theft every year. And that number may be low, as many people choose not to report the crime even if they know they have been victimized.
Identity theft is “an absolute epidemic,” states Robert Ellis Smith, a respected author and advocate of privacy. “It’s certainly picked up in the last four or five years. It’s worldwide. It affects everybody, and there’s very little you can do to prevent it and, worst of all, you can’t detect it until it’s probably too late.”
Unlike your fingerprints, which are unique to you and cannot be given to someone else for their use, you personal data, especially your social security number, your bank account or credit card number, your telephone calling card number, and other valuable identifying data, can be used, if they fall into the wrong hands, to personally profit at your expense. In the United States and Canada, for example, many people have reported that unauthorized persons have taken funds out of their bank or financial accounts, or, in the worst cases, taken over their identities altogether, running up vast debts and committing crimes while using the victims’ names. In many cases, a victim’s losses may included not only out-of-pocket financial losses, but substantial additional financial costs associated with trying to restore his reputation in the community and correcting erroneous information for which the criminal is responsible.
According to the FBI, identity theft is the number one fraud committed on the Internet. So how do job seekers protect themselves while continuing to circulate their resumes online? The key to a successful online job search is learning to manager the risks. Here are some tips for staying safe while conducting a job search on the Internet.
1. Check for a privacy policy.
If you are considering posting your resume online, make sure the job search site your are considering has a privacy policy, like CareerBuilder.com. The policy should spell out how your information will be used, stored and whether or not it will be shared. You may want to think twice about posting your resume on a site that automatically shares your information with others. You could be opening yourself up to unwanted calls from solicitors (推销员).
When reviewing the site’s privacy policy, you’ll be able to delete your resume just as easily as you posted it. You won’t necessarily want your resume to remain out there on the Internet once you land a job. Remember, the longer your resume remains posted on a job board, the more exposure, both positive and not-so-positive, it will receive.
2. Take advantage of site features.
Lawful job search sites offer levels of privacy protection. Before posting your resume, carefully consider your job search objective and the level of risk you are willing to assume.
CareerBuilder.com, for example, offers three levels of privacy from which job seekers can choose. The first is standard posting. This option gives job seekers who post their resumes the most visibility to the broadest employer audience possible.
The second is anonymous (匿名的) posting. This allows job seekers the same visibility as those in the standard posting category without any of their contact information being displayed. Job seekers who wish to remain anonymous but want to share some other information may choose which pieces of contact information to display.
The third is private posting. This option allows a job seeker to post a resume without having it searched by employers. Private posting allows job seekers to quickly and easily apply for jobs that appear on CareerBuilder.com without retyping their information.
3. Safeguard your identity.
Career experts say that one of the ways job seekers can stay safe while using the Internet to search out jobs is to conceal their identities. Replace your name on your resume with a generic (泛指的) identifier, such as “Intranet Developer Candidate,” or “Experienced Marketing Representative.”
You should also consider eliminating the name and location of your current employer. Depending on your title, it may not be all that difficult to determine who you are once the name of your company is provided. Use a general description of the company such as “Major auto manufacturer,” or “International packaged goods supplier.”
If your job title is unique, consider using the generic equivalent instead of the exact title assigned by your employer.
4. Establish and email address for your search.
Another way to protect your privacy while seeking employment online is to open up an email account specifically for your online job search. This will safeguard your existing email box in the event someone you don’t know gets hold of your email address and shares it with others.
Using an email address specifically for you job search also eliminates the possibility that you will receive unwelcome emails in your primary mailbox. When naming your new email address, be sure that it doesn’t contain references to your name or other information that will give away your identity. The best solution is an email address that is relevant to the job you are seeking such as salesmgr2004@provider.com.
5. Protect your reference.
If your resume contains a section with the names and contact information of your references, take it out. There’s no sense in safeguarding your information while sharing private contact information of your references.
6. Keep confidential (机密的) information confidential.
Do not, under any circumstances, share your social security, driver’s license, and bank account numbers or other personal information, such as race or eye color. Honest employers do not need this information with an initial application. Don’t provide this even if they say they need it in order to conduct a background check. This is one of the oldest tricks in the book – don’t fall for it.

Section B
Directions:	There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
I’ve been writing for most of my life. The book Writing Without Teachers introduced me to one distinction and one practice that has helped my writing processes tremendously. The distinction is between the creative mind and the critical mind. While you need to employ both to get to a finished result, they cannot work in parallel no matter how much we might like to think so.
Trying to criticize writing on the fly is possibly the single greatest barrier to writing that most of us encounter. If you are listening to that 5th grade English teacher correct your grammar while you are trying to capture a fleeting (稍纵即逝的) thought, the thought will die. If you capture the fleeting thought and simply share it with the world in raw form, no one is likely to understand. You must learn to create first and then criticize if you want to make writing the tool for thinking that it is.
The practice that can help you past your learned bad habits of trying to edit as you write is what Elbow calls “free writing.” In free writing, the objective is to get words down on paper non-stop, usually for 15-20 minutes. No stopping, no going back, no criticizing. The goal is to get the words flowing. As the words begin to flow, the ideas will come from the shadows and let themselves be captured on your notepad or your screen.
Now you have raw materials that you can begin to work with using the critical mind that you’ve persuaded to sit on the side and watch quietly. Most likely, you will believe that this will take more time than you actually have and you will end up staring blankly at the pages as the deadline draws near.
Instead of staring at a blank start filling it with words no matter how bad. Halfway through you available time, stop and rework your raw writing into something closer to finished product.

Passage Two
I don’t ever want to talk about being a woman scientist again. There was a time in my life when people asked constantly for stories about what it’s like to work in a field dominated by men. I was never very good at telling those stories because truthfully I never found them interesting. What I do find interesting is the origin of the universe, the shape of space-time and the nature of black holes.
At 19, when I began studying astrophysics, it  did not bother me in the least to be the only woman in the classroom. But while earning my Ph.D. at MIT and then as a post-doctor doing space research, the issue started to bother me. My every achievement—jobs, research papers, awards—was viewed through the lens of gender (性别) politics. So were my failures. Sometimes, when I was pushed into an argument on left brain versus (相对于) right brain, or nature versus nurture (培育), I would instantly fight fiercely on my behalf and all womankind.
Then one day a few years ago, out of my mouth came a sentence that would eventually become my reply to any and all provocations: I don’t talk about that anymore. It took me 10 years to get back the confidence I had at 19 and to realize that I didn’t want to deal with gender issues. Why should curing sexism be yet another terrible burden on every female scientist? After all, I don’t study sociology or political theory.
Today I research and teach at Barnard, a women’s college in New York City. Recently, someone asked me how may of the 45 students in my class were women. You cannot imagine my satisfaction at being able to answer, 45. I know some of my students worry how they will manage their scientific research and a desire for children. And I don’t dismiss those concerns. Still, I don’t tell them “war” stories. Instead, I have given them this: the visual of their physics professor heavily pregnant doing physics experiments. And in turn they have given me the image of 45 women driven by a love of science. And that’s a sight worth talking about.
62.	Why doesn’t the author want to talk about being a woman scientist again?
A) She feels unhappy working in male-dominated fields.
B) She is fed up with the issue of gender discrimination.
C) She is not good at telling stories of the kind.
D) She finds space research more important.
63.	From Paragraph 2, we can infer that people would attribute the author’s failures to ________.
A) the very fact that she is a woman
B) her involvement in gender politics
C) her over-confidence as a female astrophysicist
D) the burden she bears in a male-dominated society
64.	What did the author constantly fight against while doing her Ph.D. and post-doctoral research?
A) Lack of confidence in succeeding in space science.
B) Unfair accusations from both inside and outside her circle.
C) People’s stereotyped attitude toward female scientists.
D) Widespread misconceptions about nature and nurtured.
65.	Why does the author feel great satisfaction when talking about her class?
A) Female students no longer have to bother about gender issues.
B) Her students’ performance has brought back her confidence.
C) Her female students can do just as well as male students.
D) More female students are pursuing science than before.
66.	What does the image the author presents to her students suggest?
A) Women students needn’t have the concerns of her generation.
B) Women have more barriers on their way to academic success.
C) Women can balance a career in science and having a family.
D) Women now have fewer problems pursuing a science career.

Univeraities Branch Out
     As never before in their long story, universities have become instruments of national 
competition as well as instruments of peace. They are the place of the scientific discoveries that 
move economies forward, and the primary means of educating the talent required to obtain and 
maintain competitive advantages. But at the same time, the opening of national borders to the flow 
of goods, services, information and especially people has made universities a powerful force for 
global integration, mutual understanding and geopolitical stability.
   In response to the same forces that have driven the world economy, universities have become 
More self-consciousy global: seeking students from around the world who represent the entire 
range of cultures and values, sending their own students abroad to prepare them for global careers, 
offering courses of study that address the challenges of an interconnected world and collaborative
（合作的）research programs to advance science for the benefit of all humanity.
Of the forces shaping higher education none is more sweeping than the movement across borders. Over the past three decades the number of students leaving home each year to study abroad has grown at an annual rate of 3.0 percent, from 8000,000 in 1975 to 2.5 million in 2994. Most travel from one developed nation to another, but the flow from developing to developed countries id growing rapidly. The reverse flow, from developed to developing countries, is on the rise, too. Today foreign students earn 30 percent of the doctoral degrees awarded in the United States and 38 percent of those in the United Kingdom. And the number crossing borders for undergraduate study is growing as well, to 8 percent of the undergraduates at America’s best institutions and 10 percent of all undergraduates in the U.K. In the United States, 20 percent of the newly hired professors in science and engineering are foreign-born, and in China many newly hired faculty hired faculty members at the top research universities received their graduate education abroad.
	Universities are also encouraging students to spend some of their undergraduate years in another country. In Europe, more than 140,000 students participate in the Erasmus program each year, taking courses for credit in one of 2, 2000 participating institutions across the continent. And in the United States, institutions are helping place students in summer internships（实习）abroad to prepare them for global careers. Yale and Harvard have led the way, offering every undergraduate at least one international study or internship opportunity and providing the financial resources to make it possible.
　　Globalization is also reshaping the way research is done. One new trend involves sourcing portions of a research program to another country. Yale professor and Howard Hughes Medical Shanghai’s Fudan University, in collaboration with faculty colleagues from both schools. The Shanghai center has 95 employees and graduate students working in a 4,300-square-meter laboratory seminars with scientists from both campuses. The arrangement benefits both countries;
Xu’s Yale lab is more productive, thanks to the lower costs of conducing from a word-class scientist and his U.S. team.
　　As a result of its strength in science, the United States has consistently led of the world in the world in the commercialization of major new technologies, from the mainframe computer and integrated circuit of the 1960s to the internet infrastructure(基础设施)and applications software of 
the 1990s.The link between university-based science and industrial application is often indirect but sometimes highly visible: Silicon Valley was intentionally created by Stanford University, and
Route 128 outside Boston has long housed companies spun off from MIT and Harvard. Around the world ,governments have encouraged copying of his model, perhaps most successfully in Cambridge, England, where Microsoft and scores of other leading software and biotechnology companies have set up shop around the university.
　　For all its success, the United States remains deeply hesitant about sustaining the research university model. Most politician recognize the link between investment in science and national 
Economic strength, but support for research funding has been unsteady. The budget of the National Institutes of Health doubled between 1998 and 2003,but has risen more slowly than inflations since then. Support for the physical sciences and engineering barely kept pace with inflation during that same period. The attempt to make up lost ground is welcome, but the nation would be better served by steady, predictable increases in science funding at the rate of long-term GDP growth, which is on the order of inflation plus 3 percent per year.
　　American politicians have great difficulty recognizing that admitting more foreign students can greatly promote the national interest by increasing international understanding. Adjusted for inflation, public funding for international exchanges and foreign-language study is well below the levels of 40 years ago. In the wake of September 11,changes in the visa process caused a dramatic decline in the number of foreign students seeking admission to U.S. Universities, and a corresponding surge in enrollments in Australia, Singapore and the U .K. Objections from Americans university and business leaders led to improvements in the process and a reversal of the decline ,but the United States is still seen by many as unwelcoming to international students.
　　Most Americans recognize that universities contribute to the nation’s well-being through their scientific research, but many fear that foreign students threaten American competitiveness by taking their knowledge and skills back home. They fail to grasp that welcoming foreign students and like immigrants throughout history-strength the nation; and second, foreign students who study in the United States become ambassadors for many of its most cherished(珍视) values when they return home. Or at least they understand them better. In America as elsewhere, few Instruments of foreign policy are as effective in promoting peace and stability as welcoming international university students.

Directions:  There are 2 passages in this section . Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them are four choices marked A), B), C) and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One 
Questions 57 to 61 are based on following passage.

By almost any measure , there is a boom in Internet-based instruction . In just a few years , 34 percent of American universities have begun offering some form of distance learning (DL), and among the larger schools , it’s closer to 90 percent . If you doubt the popularity of the trend, you probably haven’t . It enrolls 90,000 student , a statistic used to support its claim to be the largest private university in the country.
While the kinds of instruction offered in these programs will differ, DL usually signifies a course in which the instructions post syllabi(课程大纲), reading assignments , and schedules on Websites , and students send in their assignments by e-mail . Generally speaking , face-to-face communication with an instructor is minimized or eliminated altogether.
The attraction for students might at first seem obvious . Primarily , there’s the convenience promised by courses on the Net: you can do the work, as they say , in your pajamas(睡衣). But figures indicate that the reduced effort results in a reduced commitment to the course . While dropout rates for all freshmen at American universities is around 20 percent , the rate for online students is 35 percent . Students themselves seem to understand the weaknesses inherent in the setup . In a survey conducted for eCornell , the DL division of Cornell University , less than a third of the respondents expected the quality of the online course to be as good as the classroom course.
Cleary form the schools perspective , there’s a lot of money to be saved .

Passage Two
Questions62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
In this age of Internet chat, videogames and reality television, there is no shortage of mindless activities to keep a child occupied. Yet, despite the competition, my 8-year-old daughter Rebecca wants to spend her leisure time writing short stories. She wants to enter one of her stories into a writing contest, a competition she won last yes.
As a writer I know about winning contest, and about losing them. I know what it is like to work hard on a story only to receive a rejection slip from the publisher. I also know the pressures of trying to live up to a reputation created by previous victories. What if she doesn’t win the contest again? That’s the strange thing about being a parent. So many of our own past scars and dashed hopes can surface.
A revelation（启示）came last week when I asked her, “Don’t you want to win again?” “No,” she replied, “I just want to tell the story of an angel going to first grade.”
I had just spent weeks correcting her stories as she spontaneously（自由地）told them. Telling myself that I was merely an experienced writer guiding the young writer across the hall, I offered suggestions for characters, conflicts and endings for her tales. The story about a fearful angel starting first trade was quickly “guided” by me into the tale of a little girl with a wild imagination taking her fist music lesson. I had turned her contest into my contest without even realizing it.
　Staying back and giving kids space to grow is not as easy as it looks. Because I konw very little about farm animals who use tools or angels who go to first grade, I had to accept the fact that I was co-opting（借用）my daughter’s experence.
   While stepping back was difficult for me, it was certainly a good first step that I will quickly follow with more steps, putting myself far enough away to give her room but close enough to help if asked. All the while I will be reminding myself that children need room to experiment, grow and find their own voices.

Part III Listening Comprehension
11. W: I ran into Sally the other day. I could hardly recognize her. Do you remember her from high school?
   M: Yeah, she was a little out of shape back then. Well, has she lost a lot of weight?
   Q: What does the man remember of Sally?
12. W: We don’t seem to have a reservation for you, sir. I’m sorry.
   M: But my secretary said that she had reserved a room for me here. I phoned her from the airport this morning just before I got on board the plane.
   Q: Where does the conversation most probably take place?
13. W: What would you do if you were in my place?
   M: If Paul were my son, I’d just not worry. Now that his teacher is giving him extra help and he is working hard himself, he’s sure to do well in the next exam.
   Q: What’s the man’s suggestion to the woman?
14. M: You’ve had your hands full and have been overworked during the last two weeks. I think you really need to go out and get some fresh air and sunshine.
   W: You are right. That’s just what I’m thinking about.
   Q: What’s the woman most probably going to do?
15. W: Hello, John. How are you feeling now? I hear you’ve been ill.
   M: They must have confused me with my twin brother Rod. He’s been sick all week, but I’ve never felt better in my life.
   Q: What do we learn about the man?
16. M: Did you really give away all your furniture when you moved into the new house last month?
   W: Just the useless pieces, as I’m planning to purchase a new set from Italy for the sitting room only.
   Q: What does the woman mean?
17. M: I’ve brought back your Oxford Companion to English Literature. I thought you might use it for your paper. Sorry not to have returned it earlier.
   W: I was wondering where that book was.
   Q: What can we infer from that conversation?
18. W: To tell the truth, Tony, it never occurs to me that you are an athlete.
   M: Oh, really? Most people who meet me, including some friends of mine, don’t think so either.
   Q: What do we learn from the conversation?
 
Conversation One
M: Mary, I hope you are packed and ready to leave.
W: Yes, I’m packed, but not quite ready. I can’t find my passport.
M: Your passport? That’s the one thing you mustn’t leave behind.
W: I know. I haven’t lost it. I’ve packed it, but I can’t remember which bag it’s in.(19)
M: Well, you have to find it at the airport. Come on, the taxi is waiting. (21)
W: Did you say taxi? I thought we were going in your car.
M: Yes, well, I had planned to, but I’ll explain later. You’ve got to be there in an hour.
W: The plane doesn’t leave for two hours. Anyway, I’m ready to go now.
M: Now you are taking just one case, is that right?
W: No, there is one in the hall（客厅、门厅）as well. (22)
M: Gosh, what a lot of stuff! You’re taking enough for a month instead of a week. (20)
W: Well, you can’t depend on the weather. It might be cold.
M: It’s never cold in Rome. Certainly not in May. Come on, we really must go.
W: Right, we are ready. We’ve got the bags. I’m sure there is no need to rush. (21)
M: There is. I asked the taxi driver to wait two minutes, not twenty. (21)
W: Look, I’m supposed to be going away to relax. You’re making me nervous.
M: Well, I want you to relax on holidays, but you can’t relax yet.
W: OK, I promise not to relax, at least not until we get to the airport and I find my passport.

W: Oh, what is it? What do they want? (24)
M: Wait a minute. Er, here it is. The European Space Agency is recruiting translators. (24)
W: The European Space Agency?
M: Well, that’s what it says. They need an English translator to work for French or German. (24)
W: So they need a degree in French or German, I suppose. Well, I’ve got that. What’s more, I have plenty of experience. What else are they asking for?
M: Just that. A university degree and three or four years of experience as a translator in a professional environment, They also say the person should have a lively and enquiring mind, effective communication skills and the ability to work individually or as a part of the team.
W: Well, if I stay at my present job much longer, I won’t have any mind or skills left. By the way, what about salary? I just hope it isn’t lower than what I get now.
M: It’s said to be negotiable. It depends on the applicant’s education and experience. (25) In addition to basic salary, there is a list of extra benefits. Have a look yourself.
W: Hmm, travel and social security plus relocation expenses are paid. Hey this isn’t bad. I really want the job.

Section B
Passage One
When couples get married, they usually plan to have children. Sometimes, however, a couple can not have a
child of their own. In this case, they may decide to adopt a child. In fact, adoption is very common today. There are about 60 thousand adoptions each year in the United States alone. Some people prefer to adopt infants, others to adopt older children. Some couples adopt children from their own countries, others adopt children from foreign countries. In any case, they all adopt children for the same reason——they care about children and want to give their adopted child a happy life. (26)
Most adopted children know that they are adopted. Psychologists and child-care experts generally think this is a good idea. However, many adopted children or adoptees have very little information about their biological parents. As a matter of fact, it is often very difficult for adoptees to find out about their birth parents because the birth records of most adoptees are usually sealed.(27) The information is secret so no one can see it.(27) Naturally, adopted children have different feelings about their birth parents. Many adoptees want to search for them, but others do not. The decision to search for birth parents is a difficult one to make. Most adoptees have mixed feelings about finding their biological parents. (28) Even though adoptees do not know about their natural parents, they do know that their adopted parents want them, love them and will care for them. (29)
 
Questions 26 to 29 are based on the passage you have just heard
26. According to the speaker, why do some couples adopt children?
27. Why is it difficult for adoptees to find out about their birth parents?
28. Why do many adoptees find it hard to make the decision to search for their birth parents?
29. What can we infer from the passage?
 
Passage Two
Catherine Gram graduated from the University of Chicago in 1938 and got a job as a news reporter in san Francisco. Catherine’s father used to be a successful investment banker. In 1933, he bought a failing newspaper, The Washington Post.(30)
Then Catherine returned to Washington and got a job, editing letters in her father’s newspaper. She married Philip Gram, who took over his father-in-law’s position shortly after and became a publisher of The Washington Post. But for many years, her husband suffered from mental illness and he killed himself in 1963. After her husband’s death, Catherine operated the newspaper. In the 1970s, the newspaper became famous around the world and Catherine was also recognized as an important leader in newspaper publishing. She was the first woman to head a major American publishing company, the Washington Post company. (31) In a few years, she successfully expanded the company to include newspaper, magazine, broadcast and cable companies.
She died of head injuries after a fall when she was 84. More than 3 thousand people attended her funeral, including many government and business leaders. Her friends said she would be remembered as a woman who had an important influence on events in the United States and the world. Catherine once wrote, “The world without newspapers would not be the same kind of world.” After her death, the employees of the Washington Post wrote, “The world without Catherine would not be the same at all.”(32)
 
Questions 30 to 32 are based on the passage you have just heard
30. What do we learn from the passage about Catherine’s father?
31. What does the speaker tell us about Catherine Gram?
32. What does the comment by employees of The Washington Post suggest?
 
Passage Three
Obtaining good health insurance is a real necessity while you are studying overseas. It protects you from minor and major medical expenses that can wipe out not only your savings but your dreams of an education abroad. (33) There are often two different types of health insurance you can consider buying, international travel insurance and student insurance in the country where you will be going.
An international travel insurance policy is usually purchased in your home country before you go abroad. It generally covers a wide variety of medical services and you are often given a list of doctors in the area where you will travel who may even speak your native language. The drawback might be that you may not get your money back immediately, (34) in other words, you may have to pay all you medical expenses and then later submit your receipts to the insurance company.
On the other hand, getting student heath insurance in the country where you will study might allow you to only pay a certain percentage of the medical cost at the time of the service and thus you don’t have to have sufficient cash to pay the entire bill at once. (35) Whatever you decide, obtaining some form of health insurance is something you should consider before you go overseas. You shouldn’t wait until you are sick with a major medical bills to pay off.
 
Questions 33 to 35 are based on the passage you have just heard
33. Why does the speaker advise the overseas students to buy health insurance?
34. What is the drawback of the students, buying international travel insurance?
35. What does the speaker say about students’ getting health insurance in the country where they will study?
 
Section C Compound Dictation
More and more of the world’s population are living in towns or cities. The speed at which cities are growing in the less developed countries is alarming (36). Between 1920 and 1960 big cities in developed countries increased (37) two and a half times in size, but in other parts of the world the growth was eight times their size.
The sheer (38) size of growth is bad enough, but there are now also very disturbing (39) signs of trouble in the comparison (40) of percentages of people living in towns and percentages of people working in industry, During the nineteenth century, cities grew as a result of the growth of industry. In Europe the proportion (41) of people living in ci8ties was always smaller than that of the workforce (42) working in factories. Now, however, the reverse (43) is almost always true in the newly industrialized world: The percentage of people living in cities is much higher than the percentage working in industry.(44)
Without a base of people working in industry, these cities cannot pay for their growth; There is not enough money to build adequate houses for the people that live there, let alone the new arrivals. (45) There has been little opportunity to build water supplies or other facilities. So the figures for the growth of towns and cities represent proportional growth of unemployment and underemployment, (46) a growth in the number of hopeless and despairing parents and starving children.

Media Selection for Advertisements 
After determining the target audience for a product or service, advertising agencies must select the appropriate media for the advertisement. We discuss here the major types of media used in advertising. We focus our attention on seven types of advertising: television, newspapers, radio, magazines, out-of-home. Internet, and direct mail. 

Television
Television is an attractive medium for advertising because it delivers mass audiences to advertisers. When you consider that nearly three out of four Americans have seen the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? you can understand the power of television to communicate with a large audience. When advertisers create a brand, for example, they want to impress consumers with the brand and its image. Television provides an ideal vehicle for this type of communication.But television is an expensive medium, and not all advertisers can afford to use it.

Television's influence on advertising is fourfold. First, narrowcasting means that television channels are seen by an increasingly narrow segment of the audience. The Golf Channel, for instance.
is watched by people who play golf. Home and Garden Television is seen by those interested in household improvement projects. Thus, audiences are smaller and more homogeneous(具有共同特点的) than they have been in the past. Second, there is an increase in the number of television channels available to viewers, and thus, advertisers. This has also resulted in an increase in the sheer number of advertisements to which audiences are exposed. Third, digital recording devices allow audience members more control over which commercials they watch. Fourth, control over programming is being passed from the networks to local cable operators and satellite programmers.

Newspaper?

After television, the medium attracting the next largest annual ad revenue is newspapers. The New York Times, which reaches a national audience, accounts for $1 billion in ad revenue annually, ii m increased its national circulation (发行量) by 40% and is now available for home delivery in ion ciues. Locally, newspapers are the largest advertising medium. 

Newspapers are a less expensive advertising medium than television and provide a way for advertisers to communicate a longer. more detailed message to their audience than they can through 48 hours,meaning newspapers are also a quick way of getting the massage out.Newspapers are ofen the most important form of news for a local community, and they develop a high degree of loyalty from local reader.

Radio 

Advertising on radio continues to grow Radio is often used in conjunction with outdoor bill-boards (广告牌) and ihe Internet to reach even more customers than television. Advertisers are likely to use radio because it is a less expensive medium than television, which means advertisers can afford to repeal their ads often. Internet companies are also turning 10 radio advertising. Radio provides a way for advertisers to communicate with audience members at all times of the day.Consumers listen to radio on their way to school or work, at work, on the way home, and in the evening hours. 

Two major changes—satellite and Internet radio—will force radio advertisers to adapt their methods. Both of these radio forms allow listeners to tune in stations that are more distant than the
local stations they could receive in the past. As a result, radio will increasingly attract target audiences who live many miles apart. 

Magazines
Newsweeklies, women’s titles, and business magazines have all seen increases in advertising because they attract the high-end market, magazines are popular with advertisers because of the narrow market that they deliver. A broadcast medium such as network television attracts all types of audience members, but magazine audiences are more homogeneous, if you read sports illustrated, for example, you have much in common with the magazine’s other readers. Advertisers see magazines as an efficient way of reaching target audience members.

Advertiser using the print media-magazines and newspapers-will need to adapt to two main changes. First, the internet will bring larger audiences to local newspapers, these second. Advertisers will have to understand how to use an increasing number of magazines for their target audiences. Although some magazines will maintain national audiences, a large number of magazines will entertain narrower audiences.
 
Out-of-home advertising

Out-of-home advertising. Also called place-based advertising, has become an increasingly effective way of reaching consumers, who are more active than ever before. Many consumers today do not sit at home and watch television. Using billboards, newsstands, and bus shelters for advertising is an effective way of reaching these on-the-go consumers. More consumers travel longer distances to and from work, which also makes out-of-home advertising effective, technology has changed the nature of the billboard business, making it a more effective medium than in the past.
Using digital printing, billboard companies can print a billboard in 2 hours, compared with 6 days previously. This allows advertisers more variety in the types of messages they create because they. 
Can change their messages more quickly.


Internet

As consumers become more comfortable with online shopping, advertisers will seek to reach this market As consumers get more of their news and information from the Internet, the ability of television and radio to get the word out to consumers will decrease. The challenge to Internet advertisers Is to create ads that audience members remember. 

Internet advertising will play a more prominent role in organizations' advertising in the near ftuture. Internet audiences tend to be quite homogeneous, but small. Advertisers will have to adjust their methods to reach these audiences and will have to adapt their persuasive strategies to the online medium as well. 

Direct mail 

A final advertising medium is direct mail, which uses mailings to consumers to communicate a client's message Direct mail includes newsletters. postcards and special promotions. Direct mail is an effective way to build relationships with consumers.For many businesses.direct mail is the most effective from of advertising.

Passage One

Question 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.

Global warming may or may not be the great environmental crisis of the 21st century, but- regardless of whether it is or isn't - we won't do much about it. We will argue over it and may even, as a nation, make some fairly solemn-sounding commitments to avoid it. But the more dramatic and meaningful these commitments seem, the less likely they are to be observed.

A1 Gore calls global warming an "inconvenient truth," as if merely recognizing it could put us on a path to a solution. But the real truth is that we don't know enough to relieve global warming, and - without major technological breakthroughs - we can't do much about it.

From 2003 to 2050,the world 's population is projevted to grow from  6.4 billon to 9.1 billion ,a 42% increase.if energy use per person and  technology remain te same,total energy use and greenhouse gas  emissions(mainly,CO2)will be 42% higher in 2050.But that's too  low,because societies that grow richer use more energy.We need econmic  growth unless we condemn the world's poor to their present
 
Poverty and freeze everyone else's living standards.With modest  growth,energy use and greenhouse emissions more then double by 2050.

No government will adopt rigid restrictions on economic growth and  personal freeom (limits on electricity usage,driving and travel)that  might cut back global warming.Still,politicians want to show they're  "doing something"Consider the Kyoto Protoco(京都议定书).It alowed  countries that joined to punish those that didn't.But it hasn't  reduced CO2 emissions(up about 25% since 1990),and many signatories(签 字国) didn't adopt tough enough policies to hit their 2008-2012  targets.

The practical codusion is that if global warming is a potential  disaster,the only solution is new technology.Only an aggressive  research and development program miaght find ways of breaking our  dependence on fossil fuels or dealing with it.

The trouble with the global warming debate is that it has become a  moral proble when it's teally an engineering one.The inconvenient  truth is that if we don't solve the engineering problem, we're helpless.

57.What is said about global warming in the first paragraph?
A) It may not prove an environmental crisis at all.
B) It is an issue repuiring worldwide commitments.
C) Serious steps have been taken to avoid or stop it.
D) Very little will be done to bting it undet control.

58.According to the author's understanding, what is A1 Gore's view on global warming?
A) It is a reality both people and politicians are unawre of.
B) It is a phenomenon that causes us many inconveniences.
C) It is a problem that can be solved once it is recognized.
D) It is an area we actually have little knowledge about.

59.Greenhouse emissions will more than double by 2050 because of ___.
A) economic growth
B) wasteful use of energy
C) the widening gap between the rich and poor
D) the rapid advances of science and technology

60.The author believes that, since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol,____.
A) politicians have started to do something to better the situation
B) few nations have adopted real tough measures to limit energy use
C) reductions in energy consumption have greatly cut back global warming
D) international cooperation has contributed to solving envoronmental problems

61.What is the message the author intends to convey?
A) Global warming is more of a moral issue than a practical one.
B) The ultimate solution to global warming lies in new technology.
C) The debate over global warming will lead to technological breakthroughs.
D) People have to give up certain material comforts to stop global warming.

Passage Two

Question 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.

Someday a siranger will read your e-mail without your permission or scan the Website you've visited，Or perhaps someone will casually glance through your credit card purchases or cell phonebills to find out your shopping preferences or calling habits.

In fact, it's likely some of these things have already happened to you. Who would watch you without your permisson? It might be a spous, a girlfreiend, a marketing company, a boss, a cop or a criminal. Whoever it is, they will see you in a way you never intended to be seen - the 21st century equivalent of being caught naked.

Psychologists tell us boundaries are healthy, that it's important to reveal yourself to friends, family and lovers in stages, at appropriate times. But few boundaries remain. The digital bread crumbs(碎屑) you leave everywhere make it easy for strangers to reconstruct who you are, where you are and what you like. In some cases, a simple Google search can reveal what you think. Like it or not, increasingly we live in a world where you simply cannot keep a secret.

The key question is: Does that matter?

For many Americans, the answer apparently is "no."

When opinion polls ask Americans about privacy, most say they are concerned about losting it. A survery found an overwhelming pessimism about privacy, with 60 percent of respondents saying they feel their privacy is "slipping away, and that bothers me."

But people say one thing and do another. Only a tiny fraction of Americans change any behaviors in an effort to preserve their privacy. Few people turn down a discount at tollbooths(收费站) to avoid using the EZ-Pass system that can track automobile movements. And few turn donw supermarket loyalty cards. Privacy economist A lessandro Acauisti has run a series of  tests that reveal people will surrender personal information like Socail Security numbers just to get their hands on a pitiful 50-cents-off coupon(优惠卷)。

But privacy does matter - at least sometimes. It's like health: When you have it, you don't notice it. Only when it's gone do you wish you'd done more to protect it.

62. What does the author mean by saying "the 21st century equivalent of being caught naked" (Lines 3-4,Para.2)?
A) People's personal information is easily accessed without their knowledge.
B) In the 21st century people try every means to look into others' secrets.
C) People tend to be more frank with each other in the information age.
D) Criminals are easily caught on the spot with advanced technology.

63.What would psychologists advise on the relationships between friends?
A) Friends should open their hearts to each other.
B) Friends should always be faithful to each other.
C) There should be a distance even between friends.
D) There should be fewer disputes between friends.

64. Why does the author say "we live in a world where you simply cannot keep a secret" (Line5,para.3)
A) Modern society has finally evolved into an open society.
B) People leave traces around when using modern technology.
C) There are always people who are curious about others' affairs.
D) Many search engines profit by revealing people's identities.

65. What do most Americans do with regard to privacy protection?
A) They change behaviors that might disclose their identity.
B) They use various loyalty cards for business transactions.
C) They rely most and more on electronic devices.
D) They talk a lot but hardly do anything about it.

66.According to the passage, privacy is like health in that ___.
A) people will make every effort to keep it.
B) its importance is rarely understood
C) is is something that can easily be lost
D) people don't cherish it until they lose it

That’s enough, kids
　　It was a lovely day at the park and Stella Bianchi was enjoying the sunshine with her two children when a young boy, aged about four, approached her two-year-old son and pushed him to the ground.
　　“I’d watched him for a little while and my son was the fourth or fifth child he’d shoved,” she says.” I went over to them, picked up my son, turned to the boy and said, firmly, ’No, we don’t push,” What happened next was unexpected.
　　“The boy’s mother ran toward me from across the park,” Stella says,” I thought she was coming over to apologize, but instead she started shouting at me for disciplining her child, All I did was let him know his behavior was unacceptable. Was I supposed to sit back while her kid did whatever he wanted, hurting other children in the process?”
　　Getting your own children to play nice is difficult enough. Dealing with other people’s children has become a minefield.
　　In my house, jumping on the sofa is not allowed. In my sister’s house it’s encouraged. For her, it’s about kids being kids: “If you can’t do it at three, when can you do it?”
　　Each of these philosophies is valid and, it has to be said, my son loves visiting his aunt’s house. But I find myself saying “no” a lot when her kids are over at mine. That’s OK between sisters but becomes dangerous territory when you’re talking to the children of friends or acquaintances.
　　“Kids aren’t all raised the same,” agrees Professor Naomi White of Monash University.” But there is still an idea that they’re the property of the parent. We see our children as an extension of ourselves, so if you’re saying that my child is behaving inappropriately, then that’s somehow a criticism of me.”
　　In those circumstances, it’s difficult to know whether to approach the child directly or the parent first. There are two schools of thought.
　　“I’d go to the child first,” says Andrew Fuller, author of Tricky Kids. Usually a quiet reminder that ’we don’t do that here’ is enough. Kids nave finely tuned antennae (直觉) for how to behave in different settings.”
　　He points out bringing it up with the parent first may make them feel neglectful, which could cause problems. Of course, approaching the child first can bring its own headaches, too.
　　This is why White recommends that you approach the parents first. Raise your concerns with the parents if they’re there and ask them to deal with it,” she says.    
　　Asked how to approach a parent in this situation, psychologist Meredith Fuller answers: “Explain your needs as well as stressing the importance of the friendship. Preface your remarks with something like: ’I know you’ll think I’m silly but in my house I don’t want…’”
　　When it comes to situations where you’re caring for another child, white is straightforward: “common sense must prevail. If things don’t go well, then have a chat.”
　　There’re a couple of new grey areas. Physical punishment, once accepted from any adult, is no longer appropriate. “A new set of considerations has come to the fore as part of the debate about how we handle children.”
　　For Andrew Fuller, the child-centric nature of our society has affected everyone:” The rules are different now from when today’s parents were growing up,” he says, “Adults are scared of saying: ’don’t swear’, or asking a child to stand up on a bus. They’re worried that there will be conflict if they point these things out – either from older children, or their parents.”
　　He sees it as a loss of the sense of common public good and public courtesy (礼貌), and says that adults suffer form it as much as child.
　　Meredith Fuller agrees: “A code of conduct is hard to create when you’re living in a world in which everyone is exhausted from overwork and lack of sleep, and a world in which nice people are perceived to finish last.”
　　“It’s about what I’m doing and what I need,” Andrew Fuller says. ”the days when a kid came home from school and said, “I got into trouble”. And dad said, ‘you probably deserved it’. Are over. Now the parents are charging up to the school to have a go at teachers.”
　　This jumping to our children’s defense is part of what fuels the “walking on eggshells” feeling that surrounds our dealings with other people’s children. You know that if you remonstrate(劝诫) with the child, you’re going to have to deal with the parent. It’s admirable to be protective of our kids, but is it good?
　　“Children have to learn to negotiate the world on their own, within reasonable boundaries,” White says. “I suspect that it’s only certain sectors of the population doing the running to the school –better –educated parents are probably more likely to be too involved.”
　　White believes our notions of a more child-centered, it’ a way of talking about treating our children like commodities(商品). We’re centered on them but in ways that reflect positively on us. We treat them as objects whose appearance and achievements are something we can be proud of, rather than serve the best interests of the children.”
　　One way over-worked, under-resourced parents show commitment to their children is to leap to their defence. Back at the park, Bianchi’ intervention(干预) on her son’ behalf ended in an undignified exchange of insulting words with the other boy’ mother.
　　As Bianchi approached the park bench where she’d been sitting, other mums came up to her and congratulated her on taking a stand. “Apparently the boy had a longstanding reputation for bad behaviour and his mum for even worse behaviour if he was challenged.”
　　Andrew Fuller doesn’t believe that we should be afraid of dealing with other people’s kids. “look at kids that aren’t your own as a potential minefield,” he says. He recommends that we don’t stay silent over inappropriate behaviour, particularly with regular visitors.

Section B 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　If you are a male and you are reading this ,congratulations: you are a survivor .According to statistics .you are more than twice as likely to die of skin cancer than a woman ,and nine times more likely to die of AIDS. Assuming you make it to the end of your natural term, about 78 years for men in Australia, you will die on average five years before a woman.
　　There are many reasons for this-typically, men take more risks than woman and are more likely to drink and smoke but perhaps more importantly, men don’t go to the doctor.
　　“Men aren’t seeing doctors as often as they should, ” says Dr. Gullotta, “This is particularly so for the over-40s,when diseases tend to strike.”
　　Gullotta says a healthy man should visit the doctor every year or two. For those over 45,it should be at least once a year.
　　Two months ago Gullotta saw a 50-year-old ma who had delayed doing anything about his smoker’s cough for a year.
　　“When I finally saw him it had already spread and he has since died from lung cancer” he says, “Earlier detection and treatment may not have cured him, but it would have prolonged this life”
　　According to a recent survey, 95%of women aged between 15 and early 40s see a doctor once a year, compared to 70% of men in the same age group.
　　“A lot of men think they are invincible （不可战胜的）”Gullotta says “They only come in when a friend drops dead on the golf course and they think” Geez, if it could happen to him.
　　Then there is the ostrich approach,” some men are scared of what might be there and would rather not know, ” says Dr. Ross Cartmill.
　　“Most men get their cars serviced more regularly than they service their bodies,” Cartmill says .He believes most diseases that commonly affect men could be addressed by preventive check-ups.
　　Regular check-ups for men would inevitably place strain on the public purse, Cartmill says.” But prevention is cheaper in the long run than having to treat the diseases. Besides, the ultimate cost is far greater: it is called premature death.”
57.Why does the author congratulate his male readers at the beginning of the passage?
A. They are more likely to survive serious diseases today.
B. Their average life span has been considerably extended.
C. They have lived long enough to read this article.
D. They are sure to enjoy a longer and happier live.
58.What does the author state is the most important reason men die five years earlier on average than women?
A. men drink and smoke much more than women
B. men don’t seek medical care as often as women
C. men aren’t as cautions as women in face of danger
D. men are more likely to suffer from fatal diseases
59. Which of the following best completes the sentence “Geez, if it could happen to him…’(line2,para,8)?
A. it could happen to me, too
B. I should avoid playing golf
C. I should consider myself lucky
D. it would be a big misfortune
60what does Dr. Ross Cartmill mean by “the ostrich approach”(line q para.9)
A. a casual attitude towards one’s health conditions
B. a new therapy for certain psychological problems
C. refusal to get medical treatment for fear of the pain involved
D. unwillingness to find out about one’s disease because of fear
61. What does Cartmill say about regular check-ups for men?
A.They may increase public expenses
B.They will save money in the long run
C.They may cause psychological strains on men
D.They will enable men to live as long as women
Passage Two
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
　　High-quality customer service is preached(宣扬) by many ,but actually keeping customers happy is easier said than done
　　Shoppers seldom complain to the manager or owner of a retail store, but instead will alert their friends, relatives, co-workers, strangers-and anyone who will listen.
　　Store managers are often the last to hear complaints, and often find out only when their regular customers decide t frequent their competitors, according to a study jointly conducted by Verde group and Wharton school
　　“Storytelling hurts retailers and entertains consumers,” said Paula Courtney, President of the Verde group.” the store loses the customer, but the shopper must also find a replacement.”
　　On average, every unhappy customer will complain to at least four other, and will no longer visit the specific store for every dissatisfied customer, a store will lose up to three more due to negative reviews. The resulting “snowball effect” can be disastrous to retailers.
　　According to the research, shoppers who purchased clothing encountered the most problems. ranked second and third were grocery and electronics customers.
　　The most common complaints include filled parking lots, cluttered (塞满了的) shelves, overloaded racks, out-of-stock items, long check-out lines, and rude salespeople.
　　During peak shopping hours, some retailers solved the parking problems by getting moonlighting（业余兼职的）local police to work as parking attendants. Some hired flag wavers to direct customers to empty parking spaces. This guidance eliminated the need for customers to circle the parking lot endlessly, and avoided confrontation between those eyeing the same parking space.
　　Retailers can relieve the headaches by redesigning store layouts, pre-stocking sales items, hiring speedy and experienced cashiers, and having sales representatives on hand to answer questions.
　　Most importantly, salespeople should be diplomatic and polite with angry customers.
　　“Retailers who’re responsive and friendly are more likely to smooth over issues than those who aren’t so friendly.” said Professor Stephen Hoch. “Maybe something as simple as a greeter at the store entrance would help.”
　　Customers can also improve future shopping experiences by filing complaints to the retailer, instead of complaining to the rest of the world. Retailers are hard-pressed to improve when they have no idea what is wrong.

How Do You See Diversity?

 As a manager, Tiffany is responsible for interviewing applicants for some of the positions with her company .During one interview, she noticed that the candidate never made direct eye contact. She was puzzled and somewhat disappointed because she liked the individual otherwise.
 He had a perfect resume and gave good responses to her questions, but the fact that he never looked her in the eye said “untrustworthy,” so she decided to offer the job to her second choice. 
 “It wasn’t until I attended a diversity workshop that I realized the person we passed over was the perfect person,” Tiffany confesses. What she hadn’t known at the time of the interview was that the candidate’s “different” behavior was simply a cultural misunderstanding . He was an Asian-American raised in a household where respect for those in authority was shown by averting(避开) your eyes.
 “I was just thrown off by the lack of ye contact; not realizing it was cultural,” Tiffany says. “I missed out ,but will not miss that opportunity again.”
 Many of us have had similar encounters with behaviors we perceive as different. As the world becomes smaller and our workplaces more diverse, it is becoming essential to expand our under-standing of others and to reexamine some of our false assumptions .
Hire Advantage
 At a time when hiring qualified people is becoming more difficult ,employers who can eliminate invalid biases(偏爱) from the process have a distinct advantage .My company, Mindsets LLC ,helps organizations and individuals see their own blind spots . A real estate recruiter we worked with illustrates the positive difference such training can make .
 “During my Mindsets coaching session ,I was taught how to recruit a diversified workforce. I recruited people from different cultures and skill sets .The agents were able to utilize their full potential and experiences to build up the company .When the real estate market began to change, it was because we had a diverse agent pool that we were able to stay in the real estate market much longer than others in the same profession.”
Blinded by Gender
Dale is an account executive who attended one of my workshops on supervising a diverse workforce . “Through one of the sessions ,I discovered my personal bias ,” he recalls . “I learned I had not been looking at a person as a whole person , and being open to differences .” In his case , the blindness was not about culture but rather gender .
“I had a management position open in my department ;and the two finalists were a man and a woman . Had I not attended this workshop , I would have automatically assumed the man was the best candidate because the position required quite a bit of extensive travel . My reasoning would have been that even though both candidates were great and could have been successful in the position , I assumed the woman would have wanted to be home with her children and not travel .”Dale’s assumptions are another example of the well-intentioned but incorrect thinking that limits an organization’s ability to tap into the full potential of a diverse workforce .
“I learned from the class that instead of imposing my gender biases into the situation , I needed to present the full range of duties, responsibilities and expectations to all candidates and allow them to make an informed decision .” Dale credits the workshop , “because it helped me make decisions based on fairness .”
Year of the Know-It-All
Doug is another supervisor who attended one of my workshops .He recalls a major lesson learned from his own employee.
“One of my most embarrassing moments was when I had a Chinese-American employee put in a request to take time off to celebrate Chinese New Year . In my ignorance , I assumed he had his dates wrong , as the first of January had just passed . When I advised him of this , I gave him a long talking-to about turning in requests early with the proper dates .
“He patiently waited , then when I was done , he said he would like Chinese New Year did not begin January first , and that Chinese New Year ,which is tied to the lunar cycle ,is one of the most celebrated holidays on the Chinese calendar . Needless to say , I felt very embarrassed in assuming he had his dates mixed up . But I learned a great deal about assumptions , and that the timing of holidays varies considerably from culture to culture .
“Attending the diversity workshop helped me realize how much I could learn by simply asking questions and creating dialogues with my employees , rather than making assumptions and trying to be a know-it-all ,” Doug admits . “The biggest thing I took away from the workshop is learning how to be more ‘inclusive’ to differences.”
A better Bottom Line
   An open mind about diversity not only improves organizations internally , it is profitable as well . These comments from a customer service representative show how an inclusive attitude can improve sales .”Most of my customers speak English as a second language . One of the best things my company has done is to contract with a language service that offers translations over the phone . It wasn’t until my boss received Mindsets’ training that she was able to understand how important inclusiveness was to customer service . As result , our customer base has increased .”
   Once we start to see people as individuals . and discard the stereotypes , we can move positively toward inclusiveness for everyone . Diversity is about coming together and taking advantage of our differences and similarities . It is about building better communities and organizations that enhance us as individuals and reinforce our shared humanity .
　　　When we begin to question our assumptions and challenge what we think we have learned from our past , from the media, peers , family , friends , etc , we begin to realize that some of our conclusions are flawed(有缺陷的) or contrary to our fundamental values . We need to train our-selves to think differently , shift our mindsets and realize that diversity opens doors for all of us ,creating opportunities in organizations and communities that benefit everyone .

Section C
Directions : In this section , you will hear a passage three times .When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea . When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks numbered from 36 to 43 with the exact words you have just heard. For blanks numbered from 44 to 46 you are required to fill in the missing information. For these blanks, you can either use the exact words you have just heard or write down the main points in your own words. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written . 
　　　Around 120 years ago, Ebbinghaus began his study of memory. He(36)      .on studying how quickly the human mind can remember (37)      . One result of his research is known as the total time hypothesis(假设), which simply means the amount you learn (38)       on the time you spend trying to learn it . This can be taken as our first rule of learning.
　　　Although it is usually true that studying for four hours is better than studying for one, there is still the question of how we should use the four hours. For example, is it better to study for four hours (39)      or to study for one hour a day for four days in a (40)      ?. The answer, as you may have (41)      , is that it is better to spread out the study times. This (42)      , through which we can learn more (43)      .by dividing our practice time, is known as the distribution of practice effect. Thus, (44)                                                        
　　　                                                        .
　　　 But we’re not finished yet. We haven’t considered how we should study over very short periods of time. (45)                                            
                                           .Should you look at the same word in rapid succession, or look at the word and then have some delay before you look at it again ?(46)

Part IV Reading Comprehension (reading in depth) (25 minutes)
Section A
Directions:	In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.
     Every year in the first week of my English class, some students inform me that writhing is too hard. They never write, unless assignments  47  it . They fine the writing process  48  and difficult. 
     How awful to be able to speak in a language but not to write in it-  49  English , with its rich vocabulary . Being able to speak but not write is like living in an  50  mansion(豪宅) and never leaving one small room . When I meet students who think they can’t write, I know as a teacher my  51  is to show them the rest of the rooms . My task is to build fluency while providing the opportunity inherent in any writing activity to  52  the moral and emotional development of my students . One great way to do this is by having students write in a journal in class every day.
     Writing ability is like strength training. Writing needs to be done  53  , just like exercise ; just as muscles grow stronger with exercise , writing skills improve quickly with writing practice. I often see a rise in student confidence and  54  after only a few weeks of journal writing .
     Expressing oneself in writing is one of the most important skills I teach to strengthen the whole student. When my students practice journal writing, they are practicing for their future academic, political, and  55  lives . They build skills so that some day they might write a great novel, a piece of sorely needed legislation, or the perfect love letter. Every day that they write in their journals puts them a step         56  to fluency , eloquence (雄辩), and command of language .

A)closer                             I) painful
B)daily                              J) performance
C)emotional                          K) profession
D)enhance                           L) remarkably
E)enormous                          M) require
F)especially                          N) sensitive
G)hinder                             O) urge
H)mission
Section B
Directions:	There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
     The January fashion show, called FutureFashion , exemplified how far green design has come. Organized by the New York-based nonprofit Earth Pledge, the show inspired many top designers to work with sustainable fabrics for the first time. Several have since made pledges to include organic fabrics in their lines. 
     The designers who undertake green fashion still face many challenges. Scott Hahn, cofounder with Gregory of Rogan and Loomstate, which uses all-organic cotton, says high-quality sustainable materials can still be tough to fine . “Most designers with existing labels are finding there aren’t comparable fabrics that can just replace what you’re doing and shat your customers are used to,” he says. For example, organic cotton and non-organic cotton are virtually indistinguishable once woven into a dress. But some popular synthetics, like stretch nylon, still have few eco-friendly equivalents. 
     Those who do make the switch are finding they have more support. Last year the influential trade show Designers & Agents stopped charging its participation fee for young green entrepreneurs(企业家) who attend its two springtime shows in Los Angeles and New York and gave special recognition to designers whose collections are at least 25% sustainable . It now counts more than 50 green designers, up from fewer than a dozen two years ago. This week Wal-Mart is set to announce a major initiative aimed at helping cotton farmers go organic: it will buy transitional(过渡型的) cotton at higher prices , thus helping to expand the supply of a key sustainable material . “Mainstream is about to occur,” says Hahn.
     Some analysts(分析师) are less sure . Among consumers, only 18%are even aware that ecofashion exists, up from 6% four years ago. Natalie Hormilla, a fashion writer, is an example of the unconverted consumer, when asked if she owned any sustainable clothes, she replied: “Not that I’m aware of.” Like most consumers, she finds little time to shop, and when she does, she’s on the hunt for “cute stuff that isn’t too expensive.” By her own admission, green just isn’t yet on her mind. But –thanks to the combined efforts of designers, retailers and suppliers –one day it will be. 

57. What is said about FutureFashion?
　　　A) It inspired many leading designers to start going green.

    B) they have to create new brands for clothes made of organic materials .
    C) customers have difficulty telling organic from non-organic materials .
    D) quality organic replacements for synthetics are not readily available .
59. We learn from Paragraph 3 that designers who undertake green fashion        .
    A) can attend various trade shows free .
    B) are readily recognized by the fashion world 
    C) can buy organic cotton at favorable prices .
    D) are gaining more and more support .
60. What is Natalie Hormilla’s attitude toward ecofashion?
    A) She doesn’t seem to care about it.   C) She is doubtful of its practical value.
    B) She doesn’t think it is sustainable    D) She is very much opposed to the idea
61. What does the author think of green fashion?
    A) Green products will soon go mainstream.
    B) It has a very promising future.
    C) Consumers have the final say.
    D) It will appeal more to young people.
Passage Two
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
　　　Scientists have devised a way to determine roughly where a person has lived using a strand(缕) of hair , a technique that could help track the movements of criminal suspects or unidentified murder victims . 
　　　The method relies on measuring how chemical variations in drinking water show up in people’s hair. 
　　　“You’re what you eat and drink, and that’s recorded in you hair,” said Thure Cerling, a geologist at the University of Utah. 
　　　While U.S diet is relatively identical, water supplies vary. The differences result from weather patterns. The chemical composition of rainfall changes slightly as raid clouds move.
　　　Most hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are stable , but traces of both elements are also present as heavier isotopes (同位素) . The heaviest raid falls first .As a result, storms that form over the Pacific deliver heavier water to California than to Utah.
　　　Similar patterns exist throughout the U.S. By measuring the proportion of heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes along a strand of hair, scientists can construct a geographic timeline. Each inch of hair corresponds to about two months. 
　　　Cerling’s team collected tap water samples from 600 cities and constructed a mop of the regional differences. They checked the accuracy of the map by testing 200 hair samples collected from 65 barber shops.
　　　They were able to accurately place the hair samples in broad regions roughly corresponding to the movement of raid systems.
　　　“It’s not good for pinpointing (精确定位),” Cerling said . “It’s good for eliminating many possibilities.”
　　　Todd Park, a local detective, said the method has helped him learn more about an unidentified woman whose skeleton was found near Great Salt Lake.
　　　The woman was 5 feet tall. Police recovered 26 bones, a T-shirt and several strands of hair.
　　　When Park heard about the research, he gave the hair samples to the researchers. Chemical testing showed that over the two years before her death, she moved about every two months.
　　　She stayed in the Northwest, although the test could not be more specific than somewhere between eastern Oregon and western Wyoming.
　　　“It’s still a substantial area,” Park said “But it narrows it way down for me.”
62. What is the scientists’ new discovery?
　　　A) One’s hair growth has to do with the amount of water they drink.
　　　B) A person’s hair may reveal where they have lived.
　　　C) Hair analysis accurately identifies criminal suspects. 
　　　D) The chemical composition of hair varies from person to person. 
63. What does the author mean by “You’re what you eat and drink” (Line 1, Para.3)?
　　　A) Food and drink affect one’s personality development.
　　　B) Food and drink preferences vary with individuals.
　　　C) Food and drink leave traces in one’s body tissues. 
　　　D) Food and drink are indispensable to one’s existence. 
64. What is said about the rainfall in America’s West?
　　　A) There is much more rainfall in California than in Utah.
　　　B) The water it delivers becomes lighter when it moves inland.
　　　C) Its chemical composition is less stable than in other areas. 
　　　D) It gathers more light isotopes as it moves eastward.
65. What did Cerling’s team produce in their research?
　　　A) A map showing the regional differences of tap water.
　　　B) A collection of hair samples from various barber shops. 
　　　C) A method to measure the amount of water in human hair. 
　　　D) A chart illustrating the movement of the rain system.
66. What is the practical value of Cerling’s research?
　　　A) It helps analyze the quality of water in different regions. 
　　　B) It helps the police determine where a crime is committed. 
　　　C) It helps the police narrow down possibilities in detective work.
　　　D) It helps identify the drinking habits of the person under investigation.

Colleges taking another look at value of merit-based aid
　　Good grades and high tests scores still matter—a lot—to many colleges as they award financial aid.
　　But with low-income students projected to make up an ever-larger share of the college-bound population in coming years, some schools are re-examining whether that aid, typically known as “merit aid”, is the most effective use of precious institutional dollars.
　　George Washington University in Washington, D.C., for example, said last week that it would cut the value of its average merit scholarships by about one-third and reduce the number of recipients(接受者), pouring the savings, about $2.5 million, into need-based aid. Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., made a similar decision three years ago.
　　Now, Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., says it will phase out merit scholarships altogether. No current merit-aid recipients will lose their scholarships, but need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008.
　　Not all colleges offer merit aid; generally, the more selective a school, the less likely it is to do so. Harvard and Princeton, for example, offer generous need-based packages, but many families who don’t meet need eligibility(资格)have been willing to pay whatever they must for a big-name school.
　　For small regional colleges that struggle just to fill seats, merit aid can be an important revenue-builder because many recipients still pay enough tuition dollars over and above the scholarship amount to keep the institution running.
　　But for rankings-conscious schools in between, merit aid has served primarily as a tool to recruit top students and to improve their academic profits. “They’re trying to buy students,” says Skidmore College economist Sandy Baum.
　　Studies show merit aid also tends to benefit disproportionately students who could afford to enroll without it.
　　“As we look to the future, we see a more pressing need to invest in need-based aid,” says Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton, which has offered merit scholarships for 10 years. During that time, it rose in US News & World Report’s ranking of the best liberal arts colleges, from 25 to 17.
　　Merit aid, which benefited about 75 students a year, or about 4% of its student body, at a cost of about $ 1 million a year, “served us well,” Inzer says, but “to be discounting the price for families that don’t need financial aid doesn’t feel right any more.”
　　Need-based aid remains by far the largest share of all student aid, which includes state, federal and institutional grants. But merit aid, offered primarily by schools and states, is growing faster, both overall and at the institutional level.
　　Between 1995-96 and 2003-04, institutional merit aid alone increased 212%, compared with 47% for need-based grants. At least 15 states also offer merit aid, typically in a bid to enroll top students in the state’s public institutions.
　　But in recent years, a growing chorus(异口同声)of critics has begun pressuring schools to drop the practice. Recent decisions by Hamilton and others may be “a sign that people are starting to realize that there’s this destructive competition going on,” says Baum, co-author of a recent College Report that raises concerns about the role of institutional aid not based on need.
　　David Laird, president of the Minnesota Private College Council, says many of his schools would like to reduce their merit aid but fear that in doing so, they would lose top students to their competitors.
　　“No one can take one-sided action,” says Laird, who is exploring whether to seek an exemption(豁免)from federal anti-trust laws so member colleges can discuss how they could jointly reduce merit aid, “This is a merry-go-round that’s going very fast, and none of the institutions believe they can sustain the risks of trying to break away by themselves.”
　　A complicating factor is that merit aid has become so popular with middle-income families, who don’t qualify for need-based aid, that many have come to depend on it. And, as tuitions continue to increase, the line between merit and need blurs.
　　That’s one reason Allegheny College doesn’t plan to drop merit aid entirely.
　　“We still believe in rewarding superior achievements and know that these top students truly value the scholarship,” says Scott Friedhoff, Allegheny’s vice president for enrollment.
　　Emory University in Atlanta, which boasts a $4.7 billion endowment(捐赠), meanwhile, is taking another approach. This year, it announced it would eliminate loans for needy students and cap them for middle-income families. At the same time, it would expand its 28-year-old merit program.
　　“Yeah, we’re playing the merit game,” acknowledges Tom Lancaster, associate dean for undergraduate education. But it has its strong point, too, he says. “The fact of the matter is, it’s not just about the lowest-income people. It’s the average American middle-class family who’s being priced out of the market.”
　　*A few words about merit-based aid:
　　Merit-based aid is aid offered to students who achieve excellence in a given area, and is generally known as academic, athletic and artistic merit scholarships.
　　Academic merit scholarships are based on students’ grades, GPA and overall academic performance during high school. They are typically meant for students going straight to college right after high school. However, there are scholarships for current college students with exceptional grades as well. These merit scholarships usually help students pay tuition bills, and they can be renewed each year as long as the recipients continue to qualify. In some cases, students may need to be recommended by their school or a teacher as part of the qualification process. 
　　Athletic merit scholarships are meant for students that excel(突出)in sports of any kind, from football to track and field events. Recommendation for these scholarships is required, since exceptional athletic performance has to be recognized by a coach or a referee(裁判). Applicants need to send in a tape containing their best performance.
　　Artistic merit scholarships require that applicants excel in a given artistic area. This generally includes any creative field such as art, design, fashion, music, dance or writing. Applying for artistic merit scholarships usually requires that students submit a portfolio(选辑)of some sort, whether that includes a collection of artwork, a recording of a musical performance or a video of them dancing.

　　Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　In families with two working parents, fathers may have more impact on a child’s language development than mothers, a new study suggests.
　　Researchers 47 92 families form 11 child care centers before their children were a year old, interviewing each to establish income, level of education and child care arrangements. Overall, it was a group of well-class families, with married parents both living in the home.
　　When the children were 2, researchers videotaped them at home in free-play sessions with both parents, 48 all of their speech. The study will appear in the November issue of The Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology.
　　The scientists measured the 49 number of utterance (话语) of the parents, the number of different words they used, the complexity of their sentences and other 50 of their speech. On average, fathers spoke less than mothers did, but they did not differ in the length of utterances or proportion of questions asked.
　　Finally, the researchers 51 the children’s speech at age 3, using a standardized language test. The only predictors of high scores on the test were the mother’s level of education, the 52 of child care and the number of different words the father used. 
　　The researchers are 53 why the father’s speech, and not the mother’s, had an effect.
　　“It’s well 54 that the mother’s language does have an impact,” said Nadya Pancsofar, the lead author of the study. It could be that the high-functioning mothers in the study had 55 had a strong influence on their children’s speech development, Ms. Pancsofar said, “or it may be that mothers are 56 in a way we didn’t measure in the study.”

Section B
　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
　　Passage One
　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　Throughout this long, tense election, everyone has focused on the presidential candidates and how they’ll change America. Rightly so, but selfishly, I’m more fascinated by Michelle Obama and what she might be able to do, not just for this country, but for me as an African-American woman. As the potential First Lady, she would have the world’s attention. And that means that for the first time people will have a chance to get up close and personal with the type of African-American woman they so rarely see.
　　Usually, the lives of black women go largely unexamined. The prevailing theory seems to be that we’re all hot-tempered single mothers who can’t keep a man. Even in the world of make-believe, black women still can’t escape the stereotype of being eye-rolling, oversexed females raised by our never-married, alcoholic (酗酒的) mothers.
　　These images have helped define the way all women are viewed, including Michelle Obama. Before she ever gets the chance to commit to a cause, charity or foundation as First Lady, her most urgent and perhaps most complicated duty may be simple to be herself.
　　It won’t be easy. Because few mainstream publications have done in-depth features on regular African-American women, little is known about who we are, what we think and what we face on a regular basis. For better or worse, Michelle will represent us all.
　　Just as she will have her critics, she will also have millions of fans who usually have little interest in the First Lady. Many African-American blogs have written about what they’d like to see Michelle bring to the White House—mainly showing the world that a black woman can support her man and raise a strong black family. Michelle will have to work to please everyone—an impossible task. But for many African-American women like me, just a little of her poise (沉着), confidence and intelligence will go a long way in changing an image that’s been around for far too long.
　　57. Why does Michelle Obama hold a strong fascination for the author?
　　A) She serves as a role model for African women.
　　B) She possesses many admirable qualities becoming a First Lady.
　　C) She will present to the world a new image of African-American women.
　　D) She will pay closer attention to the interests of African-American women.
　　58. What is the common stereotype of African-American women according to the author?
　　A) They are victims of violence. B) They are of an inferior violence.
　　C) They use quite a lot of body language. D) They live on charity and social welfare.
　　59. What do many African-Americans write about in their blogs?
　　A) Whether Michelle can live up to the high expectations of her fans.
　　B) How Michelle should behave as a public figure.
　　C) How proud they are to have a black woman in the White House.
　　D) What Michelle should do as wife and mother in the White House.
　　60. What does the author say about Michelle Obama as a First Lady?
　　A) However many fans she has, she should remain modest,
　　B) She shouldn’t disappoint the African-American community.
　　C) However hard she tries, she can’t expect to please everybody.
　　D) She will give priority to African-American women’s concerns.
　　61. What do many African-American women hope Michelle Obama will do?
　　A) Help change the prevailing view about black women.
　　B) Help her husband in the task of changing America.
　　C) Outshine previous First Lady.
　　D) Fully display her fine qualities.
　　Passage Two
　　Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
　　When next year’s crop of high-school graduates arrive at Oxford University in the fall of 2009, they’ll be joined by a new face; Andrew Hamilton, the 55-year-old provost (教务长) of Yale, who’ll become Oxford’s vice-chancellor—a position equivalent to university president in America.
　　Hamilton isn’t the only educator crossing the Atlantic. Schools in France, Egypt, Singapore, etc, have also recently made top-level hires from abroad. Higher education has become a big and competitive business nowadays, and like so many businesses, it’s gone global. Yet the talent flow isn’t universal. High-level personnel tend to head in only one direction: outward from America.
　　The chief reason is that American schools don’t tend to seriously consider looking abroad. For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university’s budget. “We didn’t do any global consideration,” says Patricia Hayes, the board’s chair. The board ultimately picked Bruce Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist (活动家) who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university presidents: fund-raising. Fund-raising is a distinctively American thing, since U.S. schools rely heavily on donations. The fund-raising ability is largely a product of experience and necessity.
　　Many European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding. But government support has failed to keep pace with rising student number. The decline in government support has made funding-raising an increasing necessary ability among administrators and has hiring committees hungry for Americans.
　　In the past few years, prominent schools around the world have joined the trend. In 2003, when Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard, another former Yale provost, as its vice-chancellor, the university publicly stressed that in her previous job she had overseen “a major strengthening of Yale’s financial position.”
　　Of course, fund-raising isn’t the only skill outsiders offer. The globalization of education means more universities will be seeking heads with international experience of some kind of promote international programs and attract a global student body. Foreigners can offer a fresh perspective on established practices.
　　62. What is the current trend in higher education discussed in the passage?
　　A) Institutions worldwide are hiring administrators from the U.S.
　　B) A lot of political activists are being recruited as administrators.
　　C) American universities are enrolling more international students.
　　D) University presidents are paying more attention to funding-raising.
　　63. What is the chief consideration of American universities when hiring top-level administrators?
　　A) The political correctness. B) Their ability to raise funds.
　　C) Their fame in academic circles. D) Their administrative experience.
　　64. What do we learn about European universities from the passage?
　　A) The tuitions they charge have been rising considerably.
　　B) Their operation is under strict government supervision.
　　C) They are strengthening their position by globalization.
　　D) Most of their revenues come from the government.
　　65. Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard as its vice-chancellor chiefly because _____.
　　A) she was known to be good at raising money
　　B) she could help strengthen its ties with Yale
　　C) she knew how to attract students overseas
　　D) she had boosted Yale’s academic status
　　66. In what way do top-level administrators from abroad contribute to university development?
　　A) They can enhance the university’s image.
　　B) They will bring with them more international faculty.
　　C) They will view a lot of things from a new perspective.
　　D) They can set up new academic disciplines.

　　Older people must be given more chances to learn if they are to contribute to society rather than be a financial burden, according to a new study on population published recently.
　　The current people approach which 67 on younger people and on skills for employment is not 68 to meet the challenges of demographic (人口结构的) change, it says. Only 1% of the education budget is 69 spent on the oldest third of the population.
　　The 70 include the fact that most people can expect to spend a third of their lives in 71 , that there are now more people over 59 than under 16 and that 11.3 million people are 72 state pension age.
　　“ 73 needs to continue throughout life. Our historic concentration of policy attention and resources 74 young people cannot meet the new 75 ,” says the report’s author, Professor Stephen McNair.

　　People need opportunities to make a “midlife review” to 81 to the later stage of employed life, and to plan for the transition (过渡) 82 retirement, which may now happen 83 at any point from 50 to over 90, says McNair.
　　And there should be more money 84 to support people in establishing a 85 of identity and finding constructive 86 for the “third age”, the 20 or more years they will spend in healthy retired life.

　　Caught in the Web
　　A few months ago, it wasn't unusual for 47-year-old Carla Toebe to spend 15 hours per day online. She'd wake up early, turn on her laptop and chat on Internet dating sites and instant-messaging programs – leaving her bed for only brief intervals. Her household bills piled up, along with the dishes and dirty laundry, but it took near-constant complaints from her four daughters before she realized she had a problem.
　　"I was starting to feel like my whole world was falling apart – kind of slipping into a depression," said Carla. "I knew that if I didn't get off the dating sites, I'd just keep going," detaching (使脱离) herself further from the outside world.
　　Toebe's conclusion: She felt like she was "addicted" to the Internet. She's not alone.
　　Concern about excessive Internet use isn't new. As far back as 1995, articles in medical journals and the establishment of a Pennsylvania treatment center for overusers generated interest in the subject. There's still no consensus on how much time online constitutes too much or whether addiction is possible.
　　But as reliance on the Web grows, there are signs that the question is getting more serious attention: Last month, a study published in CNS Spectrums claimed to be the first large-scale look at excessive Internet use. The American Psychiatric Association may consider listing Internet addiction in the next edition of its diagnostic manual. And scores of online discussion boards have popped up on which people discuss negative experiences tied to too much time on the Web.
　　"There's no question that there're people who're seriously in trouble because they're overdoing their Internet involvement," said psychiatrist (精神科医生) Ivan Goldberg. Goldberg calls the problem a disorder rather than a true addiction.
　　Jonathan Bishop, a researcher in Wales specializing in online communities, is more skeptical. "The Internet is an environment," he said. "You can't be addicted to the environment." Bishop describes the problem as simply a matter of priorities, which can be solved by encouraging people to prioritize other life goals and plans in place of time spent online.
　　The new CNS Spectrums study was based on results of a nationwide telephone survey of more than 2,500 adults. Like the 2005 survey, this one was conducted by Stanford University researchers.About 6% of respondents reported that "their relationships suffered because of excessive Internet use." About 9% attempted to conceal "nonessential Internet use," and nearly 4% reported feeling "preoccupied by the Internet when offline."
　　About 8% said they used the Internet as a way to escape problems, and almost 14% reported they "found it hard to stay away from the Internet for several days at a time."
　　"The Internet problem is still in its infancy," said Elias Aboujaoude, a Stanford professor. No single online activity is to blame for excessive use, he said. "They're online in chat rooms, checking e-mail, or writing blogs. [The problem is] not limited to porn (色情) or gambling" websites.
　　Excessive Internet use should be defined not by the number of hours spent online but "in terms of losses," said Maressa Orzack, a Harvard University professor. "If it's a loss [where] you're not getting to work, and family relationships are breaking down as a result, then it's too much."
　　Since the early 1990s, several clinics have been established in the U. S. to treat heavy Internet users. They include the Center for Internet Addiction Recovery and the Center for Internet Behavior.
　　The website for Orzack's center lists the following among the psychological symptoms of computer addiction:
　　● Having a sense of well-being (幸福) or excitement while at the computer.
　　● Longing for more and more time at the computer.
　　● Neglect of family and friends.
　　● Feeling empty, depressed or irritable when not at the computer.
　　● Lying to employers and family about activities.
　　● Inability to stop the activity.
　　● Problems with school or job.
　　Physical symptoms listed include dry eyes, backaches, skipping meals, poor personal hygiene (卫生) and sleep disturbances.
　　People who struggle with excessive Internet use maybe depressed or have other mood disorders, Orzack said. When she discusses Internet habits with her patients, they often report that being online offers a "sense of belonging, and escape, excitement [and] fun," she said. "Some people say relief…because they find themselves so relaxed."
　　Some parts of the Internet seem to draw people in more than others. Internet gamers spend countless hours competing in games against people from all over the world. One such game, called World of Warcraft, is cited on many sites by posters complaining of a "gaming addiction."
　　Andrew Heidrich, an education network administrator from Sacramento, plays World of Warcraft for about two to four hours every other night, but that's nothing compared with the 40 to 60 hours a week he spent playing online games when he was in college. He cut back only after a full-scale family intervention (干预), in which relatives told him he'd gained weight.
　　"There's this whole culture of competition that sucks people in" with online gaming, said Heidrich, now a father of two. "People do it at the expense of everything that was a constant in their lives." Heidrich now visits websites that discuss gaming addiction regularly "to remind myself to keep my love for online games in check."
　　Toebe also regularly visits a site where posters discuss Internet overuse. In August, when she first realized she had a problem, she posted a message on a Yahoo Internet addiction group with the subject line: "I have an Internet Addiction."
　　"I'm self-employed and need the Internet for my work, but I'm failing to accomplish my work,to take care of my home, to give attention to my children," she wrote in a message sent to the group."I have no money or insurance to get professional help; I can't even pay my mortgage (抵押贷款) and face losing everything."
　　Since then, Toebe said, she has kept her promise to herself to cut back on her Internet use. "I have a boyfriend now, and I'm not interested in online dating," she said by phone last week. "It's a lot better now."

　　Section A
　　Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter.

　　Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　When we think of green buildings, we tend to think of new ones – the kind of high-tech, solar-paneled masterpieces that make the covers of architecture magazines. But the U.S. has more than 100 million existing homes, and it would be __47__ wasteful to tear them all down and __48__ them with greener versions. An enormous amount of energy and resources went into the construction of those houses. And it would take an average of 65 years for the __49__ carbon emissions from a new energy-efficient home to make up for the resources lost by destroying an old one. So in the broadest __50__, the greenest home is the one that has already been built. But at the same time, nearly half of U. S. carbon emissions come from heating, cooling and __51__ our homes, offices and other buildings. "You can't deal with climate change without dealing with existing buildings," says Richard Moe, the president of the National Trust.
　　With some __52__, the oldest homes tend to be the least energy-efficient. Houses built before 1939 use about 50% more energy per square foot than those built after 2000, mainly due to the tiny cracks and gaps that __53__ over time and let in more outside air.
　　Fortunately, there are a __54__ number of relatively simple changes that can green older homes, from __55__ ones like Lincoln's Cottage to your own postwar home. And efficiency upgrades (升级) can save more than just the earth; they can help __56__ property owners from rising power costs.

Section B
　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
　　Passage One
　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　You never see him, but they're with you every time you fly. They record where you are going,how fast you're traveling and whether everything on your airplane is functioning normally. Their ability to withstand almost any disaster makes them seem like something out of a comic book.They're known as the black box.
　　When planes fall from the sky, as a Yemeni airliner did on its way to Comoros Islands in the India ocean June 30, 2009, the black box is the best bet for identifying what went wrong. So when a French submarine (潜水艇) detected the device's homing signal five days later, the discovery marked a huge step toward determining the cause of a tragedy in which 152 passengers were killed.
　　In 1958, Australian scientist David Warren developed a flight-memory recorder that would track basic information like altitude and direction. That was the first mode for a black box, which became a requirement on all U.S. commercial flights by 1960. Early models often failed to withstand crashes, however, so in 1965 the device was completely redesigned and moved to the rear of the plane – the area least subject to impact – from its original position in the landing wells (起落架舱). The same year, the Federal Aviation Authority required that the boxes, which were never actually black, be painted orange or yellow to aid visibility.
　　Modern airplanes have two black boxes: a voice recorder, which tracks pilots' conversations,and a flight-data recorder, which monitors fuel levels, engine noises and other operating functions that help investigators reconstruct the aircraft's final moments. Placed in an insulated (隔绝的) case and surrounded by a quarter-inch-thick panels of stainless steel, the boxes can withstand massive force and temperatures up to 2,000℉. When submerged, they're also able to emit signals from depths of 20,000 ft. Experts believe the boxes from Air France Flight 447, which crashed near Brazil on June 1,2009, are in water nearly that deep, but statistics say they're still likely to turn up. In the approximately 20 deep-sea crashes over the past 30 years, only one plane's black boxes were never recovered.
　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。
　　57. What does the author say about the black box?
　　A) It ensures the normal functioning of an airplane.
　　B) The idea for its design comes from a comic book.
　　C) Its ability to ward off disasters is incredible.
　　D) It is an indispensable device on an airplane.
　　58. What information could be found from the black box on the Yemeni airliner?
　　A) Data for analyzing the cause of the crash.
　　B) The total number of passengers on board.
　　C) The scene of the crash and extent of the damage.
　　D) Homing signals sent by the pilot before the crash.
　　59. Why was the black box redesigned in 1965?
　　A) New materials became available by that time.
　　B) Too much space was needed for its installation.
　　C) The early models often got damaged in the crash.
　　D) The early models didn't provide the needed data.
　　60. Why did the Federal Aviation Authority require the black boxes be painted orange or yellow?
　　A) To distinguish them from the colour of the plane.
　　B) To caution people to handle them with care.
　　C) To make them easily identifiable.
　　D) To conform to international standards.
　　61. What do we know about the black boxes from Air France Flight 447?
　　A) There is still a good chance of their being recovered.
　　B) There is an urgent need for them to be reconstructed.
　　C) They have stopped sending homing signals.
　　D) They were destroyed somewhere near Brazil.
Passage Two
　　Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
　　The $11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like "I never do anything right" into positive ones like "I can succeed." But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking?
　　Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are.
　　The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your dim friend that he has the potential of an Einstein, you're just underlining his faults. In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written.
　　In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, "I am lovable."
　　Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation. In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts.
　　The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy (心理治疗) that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation (静思) techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic perspective. Call it the power of negative thinking.
　　注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2 上作答。
　　62. What do we learn from the first paragraph about the self-help industry?
　　A) It is a highly profitable industry.
　　B) It is based on the concept of positive thinking.
　　C) It was established by Norman Vincent Peale.
　　D) It has yielded positive results.
　　63. What is the finding of the Canadian researchers?
　　A) Encouraging positive thinking many do more harm than good.
　　B) There can be no simple therapy for psychological problems.
　　C) Unhappy people cannot think positively.
　　D) The power of positive thinking is limited.
　　64. What does the author mean by "… you're just underlining his faults" (Line 4, Para. 3)?
　　A) You are not taking his mistakes seriously enough.
　　B) You are pointing out the errors he has committed.
　　C) You are emphasizing the fact that he is not intelligent.
　　D) You are trying to make him feel better about his faults.
　　65. What do we learn from the experiment of Wood, Lee and Perunovic?
　　A) It is important for people to continually boost their self-esteem.
　　B) Self-affirmation can bring a positive change to one's mood.
　　C) Forcing a person to think positive thoughts may lower their self-esteem.
　　D) People with low self-esteem seldom write down their true feelings.
　　66. What do we learn from the last paragraph?
　　A) The effects of positive thinking vary from person to person.
　　B) Meditation may prove to be a good form of psychotherapy.
　　C) Different people tend to have different ways of thinking.
　　D) People can avoid making mistakes through meditation.

　　Due Attention Should Be Given To Spelling
　　Correct spelling is a basic skill in English study. However, nowadays many students do not pay much attention to it.
　　They have their own reasons for misspelling. First of all, they like an easy way of studying, which causes some omissions and changes in spelling. Second, the teachers might not be very strict in students’ spelling. In China, teachers seem to be more concerned with grammar and vocabulary but not spelling.
　　To change this situation, in my opinion, the teachers and the students should work together. On one and, the teachers should give more attention to students’ spelling, asking the students to be conscious of the importance of correct spelling from the very beginning of their English study. On the other hand, the students themselves are supposed to be aware that correct spelling is a must in English study.
　　To sum up, correct spelling is so important that both students and the teachers should spare no efforts to achieve correct spelling.

A Grassroots Remedy
　　Most of us spend our lives seeking the natural world. To this end, we walk the dog, play golf, go fishing, sit in the garden, drink outside rather than inside the pub, have a picnic, live in the suburbs, go to the seaside, buy a weekend place in the country. The most popular leisure activity in Britain is going for a walk. And when joggers (慢跑者) jog, they don’t run the streets. Every one of them instinctively heads to the park or the river. It is my profound belief that not only do we all need nature, but we all seek nature, whether we know we are doing so or not.
　　But despite this, our children are growing up nature-deprived (丧失). I spent my boyhood climbing trees on Streatham Common, South London. These days, children are robbed of these ancient freedoms, due to problems like crime, traffic, the loss of the open spaces and odd new perceptions about what is best for children, that is to say, things that can be bought, rather than things that can be found.
　　The truth is to be found elsewhere. A study in the US: families had moved to better housing and the children were assessed for ADHD—attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (多动症). Those whose accommodation had more natural views showed an improvement of 19%; those who had the same improvement in material surroundings but no nice view improved just 4%.
　　A study in Sweden indicated that kindergarten children who could play in a natural environment had less illness and greater physical ability than children used only to a normal playground. A US study suggested that when a school gave children access to a natural environment, academic levels were raised across the entire school.
　　Another study found that children play differently in a natural environment. In playgrounds, children create a hierarchy (等级) based on physical abilities, with the tough ones taking the lead. But when a grassy area was planted with bushes, the children got much more into fantasy play, and the social hierarchy was now based on imagination and creativity.
　　Most bullying (恃强凌弱) is found in schools where there is a tarmac (柏油碎石) playground; the least bullying is in a natural area that the children are encouraged to explore. This reminds me unpleasantly of Sunnyhill School in Streatham, with its harsh tarmac, where I used to hang about in corners fantasising about wildlife.
　　But children are frequently discouraged from involvement with natural spaces, for health and safety reasons, for fear that they might get dirty or that they might cause damage. So, instead, the damage is done to the children themselves: not to their bodies but to their souls.
　　One of the great problems of modern childhood is ADHD, now increasingly and expensively treated with drugs. Yet one study after another indicates that contact with nature gives huge benefits to ADHD children. However, we spend money on drugs rather than on green places.
　　The life of old people is measurably better when they have access to nature. The increasing emphasis for the growing population of old people is in quality rather than quantity of years. And study after study finds that a garden is the single most important thing in finding that quality.
　　In wider and more difficult areas of life, there is evidence to indicate that natural surroundings improve all kinds of things. Even problems with crime and aggressive behaviour are reduced when there is contact with the natural world.
　　Dr William Bird, researcher from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, states in his study, “A natural environment can reduce violent behaviour because its restorative process helps reduce anger and impulsive behaviour.” Wild places need encouraging for this reason, no matter how small their contribution.
　　We tend to look on nature conservation as some kind of favour that human beings are granting to the natural world. The error here is far too deep: not only do humans need nature for themselves, but the very idea that humanity and the natural world are separable things is profoundly damaging.
　　Human beings are a species of mammals (哺乳动物). For seven million years they lived on the planet as part of nature. Our ancestral selves miss the natural world and long for contact with non-human life. Anyone who has patted a dog, stroked a cat, sat under a tree with a pint of beer, given or received a bunch of flowers or chosen to walk through the park on a nice day, understands that.
　　We need the wild world. It is essential to our well-being, our health, our happiness. Without the wild world we are not more but less civilised. Without other living things around us we are less than human.
　　Five ways to find harmony with the natural world
　　Walk: Break the rhythm of permanently being under a roof. Get off a stop earlier, make a circuit of the park at lunchtime, walk the child to and from school, get a dog, feel yourself moving in moving air, look, listen, absorb.
　　Sit: Take a moment, every now and then, to be still in an open space. In the garden, anywhere that’s not in the office, anywhere out of the house, away from the routine. Sit under a tree, look at water, feel refreshed, ever so slightly renewed.
　　Drink: The best way to enjoy the natural world is by yourself; the second best way is in company. Take a drink outside with a good person, a good gathering: talk with the sun and the wind with birdsong for background.
　　Learn: Expand your boundaries. Learn five species of bird, five butterflies, five trees, five bird songs. That way, you see and hear more: and your mind responds gratefully to the greater amount of wildness in your life.
　　Travel: The places you always wanted to visit: by the seaside, in the country, in the hills. Take a weekend break, a day-trip, get out there and do it: for the scenery, for the way through the woods, for the birds, for the bees. Go somewhere special and bring specialness home. It lasts forever, after all.

　　Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　What determines the kind of person you are? What factors make you more or less bold, intelligent, or able to read a map? All of these are influenced by the interaction of your genes and the environment in which you were 47 . The study of how genes and environment interact to influence 48 activity is known as behavioral genetics. Behavioral genetics has made important 49 to the biological revolution, providing information about the extent to which biology influences mind, brain and behavior.
　　Any research that suggests that 50 to perform certain behaviors are based in biology is controversial. Who wants to be told that there are limitations to what you can 51 based on something that is beyond your control, such as your genes? It is easy to accept that genes control physical characteristics such as sex, race and eye color. But can genes also determine whether people will get divorced, how 52 they are, or what career they are likely to choose? A concern of psychological scientists is the 53 to which all of these characteristics are influenced by nature and nurture(养育), by genetic makeup and the environment. Increasingly, science 54 that genes lay the groundwork for many human traits. From this perspective, people are born 55 like undeveloped photographs: The image is already captured, but the way it 56 appears can vary based on the development process. However, the basic picture is there from the beginning.

　　Section B
　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
　　Passage One
　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　It is pretty much a one-way street. While it may be common for university researchers to try their luck in the commercial world, there is very little traffic in the opposite direction. Pay has always been the biggest deterrent, as people with families often feel they cannot afford the drop in salary when moving to a university job. For some industrial scientists, however, the attractions of academia (学术界) outweigh any financial considerations.
　　Helen Lee took a 70% cut in salary when she moved from a senior post in Abbott Laboratories to a medical department at the University of Cambridge. Her main reason for returning to academia mid-career was to take advantage of the greater freedom to choose research questions. Some areas of inquiry have few prospects of a commercial return, and Lee’s is one of them.
　　The impact of a salary cut is probably less severe for a scientist in the early stages of a career. Guy Grant, now a research associate at the Unilever Centre for Molecular Informatics at the University of Cambridge, spent two years working for a pharmaceutical (制药的) company before returning to university as a post-doctoral researcher. He took a 30% salary cut but felt it worthwhile for the greater intellectual opportunities.
　　Higher up the ladder, where a pay cut is usually more significant, the demand for scientists with a wealth of experience in industry is forcing universities to make the transition (转换) to academia more attractive, according to Lee. Industrial scientists tend to receive training that academics do not, such as how to build a multidisciplinary team, manage budgets and negotiate contracts. They are also well placed to bring something extra to the teaching side of an academic role that will help students get a job when they graduate, says Lee, perhaps experience in manufacturing practice or product development. “Only a small number of undergraduates will continue in an academic career. So someone leaving university who already has the skills needed to work in an industrial lab has far more potential in the job market than someone who has spent all their time on a narrow research project.”
　　注意： 此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。
　　57. By “a one-way street” (Line 1, Para. 1), the author means ________.
　　[A] university researchers know little about the commercial world
　　[B] there is little exchange between industry and academia
　　[C] few industrial scientists would quit to work in a university
　　[D] few university professors are willing to do industrial research
　　58. The word “deterrent” (Line 2, Para. 1) most probably refers to something that ________.
　　[A] keeps someone from taking action [C] attracts people’s attention
　　[B] helps to move the traffic [D] brings someone a financial burden
　　59. What was Helen Lee’s major consideration when she changed her job in the middle of her career?
　　[A] Flexible work hours. [C] Her preference for the lifestyle on campus.
　　[B] Her research interests. [D] Prospects of academic accomplishments.
　　60. Guy Grant chose to work as a researcher at Cambridge in order to ________.
　　[A] do financially more rewarding work
　　[B] raise his status in the academic world
　　[C] enrich his experience in medical research
　　[D] exploit better intellectual opportunities
　　61. What contribution can industrial scientists make when they come to teach in a university?
　　[A] Increase its graduates’ competitiveness in the job market.
　　[B] Develop its students’ potential in research.
　　[C] Help it to obtain financial support from industry.
　　[D] Gear its research towards practical applications.
　　Passage Two
　　Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
　　Being sociable looks like a good way to add years to your life. Relationships with family, friends, neighbours, even pets, will all do the trick, but the biggest longevity (长寿) boost seems to come from marriage or an equivalent relationship. The effect was first noted in 1858 by William Farr, who wrote that widows and widowers (鳏夫) were at a much higher risk of dying than their married peers. Studies since then suggest that marriage could add as much as seven years to a man’s life and two to a woman’s. The effect holds for all causes of death, whether illness, accident or self-harm.
　　Even if the odds are stacked against you, marriage can more than compensate. Linda Waite of the University of Chicago has found that a married older man with heart disease can expect to live nearly four years longer than an unmarried man with a healthy heart. Likewise, a married man who smokes more than a pack a day is likely to live as long as a divorced man who doesn’t smoke. There’s a flip side, however, as partners are more likely to become ill or die in the couple of years following their spouse’s death, and caring for a spouse with mental disorder can leave you with some of the same severe problems. Even so, the odds favour marriage. In a 30-year study of more than 10,000 people, Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School describes how all kinds of social networks have similar effects.
　　So how does it work? The effects are complex, affected by socio-economic factors, health-service provision, emotional support and other more physiological (生理的) mechanisms. For example, social contact can boost development of the brain and immune system, leading to better health and less chance of depression later in life. People in supportive relationships may handle stress better. Then there are the psychological benefits of a supportive partner.
　　A life partner, children and good friends are all recommended if you aim to live to 100. The ultimate social network is still being mapped out, but Christakis says: “People are interconnected, so their health is interconnected.”

　　[A] social life provides an effective cure for illness
　　[B] being sociable helps improve one’s quality of life

　　63. Linda Waite’s studies support the idea that _________.
　　[A] older men should quit smoking to stay healthy
　　[B] marriage can help make up for ill health
　　[C] the married are happier than the unmarried
　　[D] unmarried people are likely to suffer in later life
　　64. It can be inferred from the context that the “flip side” (Line 4, Para. 2) refers to _________.
　　[A] the disadvantages of being married
　　[B] the emotional problems arising from marriage
　　[C] the responsibility of taking care of one’s family
　　[D] the consequence of a broken marriage

　　[B] They help develop people’s community spirit.
　　[C] They provide timely support for those in need.
　　[D] They help relieve people of their life’s burdens.

British Cuisine: the Best of Old and New
British cuisine(烹饪) has come of age in recent years as chefs(厨师) combine the best of old and new.
    Why does British food have a reputation for being so bad? Because it is bad! Those are not the most encouraging words to hear just before eating lunch at one of Hong Kong's smartest British restaurants, Alfie's by KEE, but head chef Neil Tomes has more to say.
    "The past 15 years or so have been a noticeable period of improvement for food in England," the English chef says, citing the trend in British cuisine for better ingredients, preparation and cooking methods, and more appealing presentation. Chef such as Delia Smith, Nigel Slater, Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay made the public realise that cooking - and eating - didn't have to be a boring thing. And now, most of the British public is familiar even with the extremes of Heston Blumenthal's molecular gastronomy, a form of cooking that employs scientific methods to create the perfect dish.
    "It's no longer the case that the common man in England is embarrassed to show he knows about food," Tomes says.
There was plenty of room for improvement. The problems with the nation's cuisine can be traced back to the Second World War. Before the war, much of Britain's food was imported and when German U-boats began attacking ships bringing food to the country, Britain went on rations(配给).
    "As rationing came to an end in the 1950s, technology picked up and was used to mass-produce food," Tomes says. "And by then people were just happy to have a decent quantity of food in their kitchens."
    They weren't looking for cured meats, organic produce or beautiful presentation; they were looking for whatever they could get their hands on, and this prioritisation of quantity over quality prevailed for decades, meaning a generation was brought up with food that couldn't compete with neighbouring France, Italy, Belgium or Spain.
    Before star chefs such as Oliver began making cooking fashionable, it was hard to find a restaurant in London that was open after 9pm. But in recent years the capital's culinary(烹饪的) scene has developed to the point that it is now confident of its ability to please the tastes of any international visitor.
    With the opening of Alfie's in April, and others such as The Pawn, two years ago, modern British food has made its way to Hong Kong. "With British food, I think that Hong Kong restaurant are keeping up," says David Tamlyn, the Welsh executive chef at The Pawn in Wan Chai. "Hong Kong diners are extremely responsive to new ideas or presentations, which is good news for new dishes."
    Chefs agree that diners in Hong Kong are embracing the modern British trend. Some restaurants are modifying the recipes(菜谱)of British dishes to breathe new life into the classics, while other are using better quality ingredients but remaining true to British traditional and tastes. 
Tamlyn is in the second camp. "We select our food very particulary. We use US beef, New Zealand lamb and for our custards(牛奶蛋糊) we use Bird's Custard Powder," Tamlyn says. "Some restaurants go for custard made fresh with eggs, sugar and cream, but British custard is different, and we stay true to that."
    Matthew Hill, senior manager at the two-year-old SoHo restaurant Yorkshire Pudding, also uses better ingredients as a means of improving dishes. "There are a lot of existing perceptions about British food and so we can't alter these too much. We're a traditional British restaurant so there are some staples(主菜) that will remain essentially unchanged."
    These traditional dishes include fish and chips, steak and kidney pie and large pieces of roasted meats. At Alfie's, the newest of the British restaurants in town and perhaps the most gentlemen's club-like in design, Neil Tomes explains his passion for provenance(原产地). "Britain has started to become really proud of the food it's producing. It has excellent organic farms, beautifully crafted cheeses, high-quality meats."
    However, the British don't have a history of exporting their foodstuffs, which makes it difficult for restaurants in Hong Kong to source authentic ingredients.
    "We can get a lot of our ingredients once a week from the UK," Tamlyn explains. "But there is also pressure to buy local and save on food miles, which means we take our vegetables from the local markets, and there are a lot that work well with British staples."
    The Phoenix, in Mid-Levels, offers the widest interpretation of "British cuisine", while still trying to maintain its soul. The gastro-pub has existed in various locations in Hong Kong since 2002. Singaporean head chef Tommy Teh Kum Chai offers daily specials on a blackboard, rather than sticking to a menu. This enables him to reinterpret British cuisine depending on what is available in the local markets.
    "We use a lot of ingredients that people wouldn't perhaps associate as British, but are presented in a British way. Bell peppers stuffed with couscous, alongside ratatouille, is a very popular dish." 
Although the ingredients may not strike diners as being traditional, they can be found in dishes across Britain.
    Even the traditional chefs are aware of the need to adapt to local tastes and customs, while maintaining the Brutishness of their cuisine.
    At Yorkshire Pudding, Hill says that his staff asks diners whether they would like to share their meals. Small dishes, shared meals and "mixing it up" is not something commonly done in Britain, but Yorkshire Pudding will bring full dished to the table and offer individual plates for each dinner. "That way, people still get the presentation of the dishes as they were designed, but can carve them up however they like," Hill says.
    This practice is also popular at The Pawn, although largely for rotisseries(烤肉馆), Tamlyn says. "Some tables will arrive on Sunday, order a whole chicken and a shoulder of lamb or a baby pig, and just stay for hours enjoying everything we bring out for them."
    Some British traditions are too sacred(神圣的) to mess with, however, Tomes says. "I'd never change a full English breakfast."

The popular notion that older people need less sleep than younger adults is a myth, scientists said yesterday.
    While elderly people   47   to sleep for fewer hours than they did when they were younger, this has a(n)   48   effect on their brain's performance and they would benefit from getting more, according to research.
    Sean Drummond, a psychiatrist (心理医生) at the University of California, San Diego, said that older people are more likely to suffer from broken sleep, while younger people are better at sleeping   49   straight through the night.
    More sleep in old age, however, is   50   with better health, and most older people would feel better and more   51   if they slept for longer periods, he said.
    "The ability to sleep in one chunk (整块时间) overnight goes down as we age but the amount of sleep we need to   52   well does not change," Dr Drummond told the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in San Diego.
    "It's   53   a myth that older people need less sleep. The more healthy an older adult is, the more they sleep like they did when they were   54   . Our data suggests that older adults would benefit from    55    to get as much sleep as they did in their 30s. That's   56   from person to person, but the amount of sleep we had at 35 is probably the same amount we need at 75."
A) alert          B) associated     C) attracting      D) cling      
E) continuing     F) definitely      G) different       H) efficiently     
I) formally       J) function       K) mixed          L) negative     
M) sufficient      N) tend         O) younger
Section B 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Several recent studies have found that being randomly (随机地) assigned to a roommate of another race can lead to increased tolerance but also to a greater likelihood (可能性) of conflict.
    Recent reports found that lodging with a student of a different race may decrease prejudice and compel students to engage in more ethnically diverse friendships.
    An Ohio State University study also found that black students living with a white roommate saw higher academic success throughout their college careers. Researchers believe this may be caused by social pressure.
    In a New York Times article, Sam Roakye-the only black student on his freshman year floor-said that "if you're surrounded by whites, you have something to prove."
    Researchers also observed problems resulting from pairing interracial students in residences.
    According to two recent studies, randomly assigned roommates of different race are more likely to experience conflicts so strained that one roommate will move out.
    An Indiana University study found that interracial roommates were three times as likely as two white roommates to no longer live together by the end of the semester.
Grace Kao, a professor at Penn said she was not surprised by the findings. "This may be the first time that some of these students have interacted, and lived, with someone of a different race," she said.
    At Penn, students are not asked to indicate race when applying for housing.
    "One of the great things about freshman housing is that, with some exceptions, the process throws you together randomly," said Undergraduate Assembly chairman Alec Webley. "This is the definition of integration."
    "I've experienced roommate conflicts between interracial students that have both broken down stereotypes and reinforced stereotypes," said one Penn resident advisor (RA). The RA of two years added that while some conflicts "provided more multicultural acceptance and melding (融合)," there were also "jarring cultural confrontations."
    The RA said that these conflicts have also occurred among roommates of the same race.
    Kao said she cautions against forming any generalizations based on any one of the studies, noting that more background characteristics of the students need to be studies and explained.
57. What can we learn from some recent studies?
 A) Conflicts between studies of different races are unavoidable.
 B) Students of different races are prejudiced against each other.
 C) Interracial lodging does more harm than good.
 D) Interracial lodging may have diverse outcomes.
58. What does Sam Boakye's remark mean?
 A) White students tend to look down upon their black peers.
 B) Black students can compete with their white peers academically.
 C) Black students feel somewhat embarrassed among white peers during the freshman year.
 D) Being surrounded by white peers motivates a black student to work harder to succeed.
59. What does the Indians Univerisity study show?
 A) Interracial roommates are more likely to fall out.
 B) Few white students like sharing a room with a black peer.
 C) Roommates of different races just don't get along.
 D) Assigning students' lodging randomly is not a good policy.
60. What does Alec Webley consider to be the "definition of integration"?
 A) Students of different races are required to share room.
 B) Interracial lodging is arranged by the school for freshmen.
 C) Lodging is assigned to students of different races without exception.
 D) The school randomly assigns roommates without regard to race.
61. What does Grace Kao say about interracial lodging?
 A) It is unscientific to make generalizations about it without further study.
 B) Schools should be cautious when making decisions about student lodging.
 C) Students' racial background should be considered before lodging is assigned.
 D) Experienced resident advisors should be assigned to handle the problems. 
Passage Two
Global warming is causing more than 300,000 deaths and about $125 billion in economic losses each year, according to a report by the Global Humanitarian Forum, an organization led by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general.
    The report, to be released Friday, analyzed data and existing studies of health, disaster, population and economic trends. It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition (营养不良) and heat-related health problems.
    But even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.
    Along with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.
    Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum's report was " a methodological embarrassment" because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable (易受伤害的) regions. Dr. Pielke said that "climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention." But the report, he said, "will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed (有瑕疵的)"
    However, Soren Anderasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.
    In a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards, while still curbing the emissions of the heat-trapping gases. More than 90% of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report.
62. What is the finding of the Global Humanitarian Forum?
 A) Global temperatures affect the rate of economic development.
 B) Rates of death from illness have risen due to global warming.
 C) Malnutrition has caused serious health problems in poor countries.
 D) Economic trends have to do with population and natural disasters.
63. What do we learn about the Forum's report from the passage?
 A) It was challenged by some climate and risk experts.
 B) It aroused a lot of interest in the scientific circles.
 C) It was warmly received by environmentalists.  
D) It caused a big stir in developing countries.
64. What does Dr. Pielke say about the Forum's report?
 A) Its statistics look embarrassing.   
B) It is invalid in terms of methodology.
 C) It deserves our closest attention.   
D) Its conclusion is purposely exaggerated.
65. What is Soren Andreasen's view of the report?
 A) Its conclusions are based on carefully collected data.
 B) It is vulnerable to criticism if the statistics are closely examined.
 C) It will give rise to heated discussions at the Copenhagen conference.
 D) Its rough estimates are meant to draw the attention of world leaders.
66. What does Kofi Annan say should be the focus of the Copenhagen conference?
 A) How rich and poor regions can share responsibility in curbing global warming.
 B) How human and economic losses from climate change can be reduced.
 C) How emissions of heat-trapping gases can be reduced on a global scale.
 D) How rich countries can better help poor regions reduce climate hazards. 
Part Ⅴ  Cloze (15 minutes) 
Directions: There are 20 blanks in the following passage. For each blank there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D) on the right side of the paper. You should choose the ONE that best fits into the passage. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre
When it comes to eating amart for your heart, stop thinking about short-term fixes and simplify your life with a straightforward approach that will serve you well for years to come.
    Smart eating goes beyond analyzing every bite of food you lift   67   your mouth. "In the past we used to believe that   68   amounts of individual nutrients (营养物) were the   69   to good health," says Linda Van Horn, chair of the American Heart Association's Nutrition Committee. "But now we have a   70   understanding of healthy eating and the kinds of food necessary to   71   not only heart disease but disease   72   general," she adds.
    Scientists now   73   on the broader picture of the balance of food eaten   74   several days or a week   75   than on the number of milligrams (毫克) of this or that   76   at each meal. Fruits, vegetables and whole grains, for example, provide nutrients and plant-based compounds   77   for good health. "The more we learn, the more   78   we are by the wealth of essential substances they   79   ," Van Horn continues, "and how they   80   with each other to keep us healthy."
    You'll automatically be   81   the right heart-healthy track if vegetables, fruits and whole grains make   82   three quarters of the food on your dinner plate.   83   in the restaurant one quarter with lean meat or chicken, fish or eggs.
    The foods you choose to eat as well as those you choose to   84   clearly contribute to your well-being. Without a   85   , each of the small decisions you make in this realm can make a big   86   on your health in the years to come.
67. A) between   B) through     C) inside     D) to

Why Integrity Matters
What Is Integrity?
　　　The key to integrity is consistency- not only setting high personal standards for oneself (honesty, responsibility, respect for others, fairness) but also living up to those standards each and every day. One who has integrity is bound by and follows moral and ethical (道德上的) standards even when making life's hard choices, choices which may be clouded by stress, pressure to succeed, or temptation.
　　　What happens if we lie, cheat, steal, or violate other ethical standards? We feel disappointed in ourselves and ashamed. But a lapse (缺失) of integrity also affects our relationships with others. Trust is essential in any important relationship, whether personal or professional. Who can trust someone who is dishonest or unfair? Thus integrity must be one of our most important goals.
Risky Business
　　　We are each responsible for our own decisions, even if the decision, making process has been undermined by stress or peer pressure. The real test of character is whether we can learn from our mistake, by understanding why we acted as we did and then exploring ways to avoid similar problems in the future.
　　　Making ethical decisions is a critical part of avoiding future problems. We must learn to recognize risks, because if we can't see the risks we're taking, we can't make responsible choices. To identify risks, we need to know the rules and be aware of the facts. For example, one who doesn't know the rules a about plagiarism (剽窃) may accidentally use words or ideas without giving proper credit or one who fails to keep careful research notes may unintentionally fail to quote and cite sources as required. But the fact that such a violation is "unintentional" does not excuse the misconduct, Ignorance is not a defense.
"But Everybody Does It"
　　　Most people who get in trouble do know the rules and facts but manage to fool themselves about the risks they're taking by using excuses: "Everyone else does it." "I'm not hurting anyone", or "I really need this grade." Excuses can get very elaborate: "I know I'm look at another's exam, even though I'm supposed to keep my eyes on my own paper, but that's not cheating because I’m just checking my answers, not copying." We must be honest about our actions and avoid excuses, if we fool ourselves into believing we're not doing anything wrong, we can't see the real choice we're making - and that leads to bad decisions.
　　　To avoid fooling yourself, watch out for excuses and try this test: Ask how you would feel if your actions were public and anyone could be watching over your shoulder. If you'd rather hide your actions, that's an indication that you're taking a risk and rationalizing it to yourself.
Evaluating Risks
　　　To decide whether a risk is worth taking, you must examine the consequences, in the future as well as right now, negative as well as positive, and to others as well as to yourself. Those who take risks they later regret usually focus on immolate benefits and simply haven't considered what might go wrong. The consequences of getting caught are serious and may include a "O" on a test or assignment, an "F" in the class, suspension (暂令停学) or dismissal from school and a ruined reputation. In fact, when you break a role or law, you lose control over your life and give others the power to impose punishment that you have no control over. This is an extremely vulnerable (脆弱的) position. There may be some matters of life and death or highest principle, which might justify such a risk, but there aren't many things that fall in this category.
Getting Away with it - Or Not
　　　Those who don't get caught pay an even higher price. A cheater doesn't learn from the test, which deprives (剥夺) him her of an education. Cheating undermines confidence and independence: the cheater is a fraud, and knows that without dishonesty, he/she would have failed. Cheating destroys self-respect and integrity, leaving the cheater ashamed, guilty and afraid of getting caught.
　　　Worst of all, a cheater who doesn't get caught the first time usually cheats again, not only because he/she is farther behind, but also because it seems "easier." This slippery slope of eroding ethics and bigger risks leads only to disaster. Eventually, the cheater gets caught, and the later he/she gets caught, the worse the consequences.
Cheating Hurts Other, Too
　　　Cheaters often feel invisible, as if their actions "don't count" and don't really hurt anyone. But individual choices have an intense cumulative (累积的) effect. Cheating can spread like a disease. Recent statistics suggest 30％or more of college students cheat. If a class is graded on a curve, cheating hurts others' grades. Even if there is no curve, cheating "poisons" the classroom, and others may feel pressured to join in. ("If I don't cheat I can't compete with those who do") Cheating also has a destructive impact on teachers. The real reward of goof teaching is seeing students learn. But a cheater says. "I'm not interested in what you're trying to teach, all I care about is stealing a grade, regardless of the effect on others." The end result is a destructive attack on the quality of your education. Finally, cheating can hurt the reputation of the university and harm those who worked hard for their degree.
Why Integrity Marten
　　　If cheating becomes the norm, then we are in big trouble. We must rely on the honesty and good faith of others, if not, we couldn't put money in the bank, buy food, clothing, or medicine from others, drive across a bridge, get on a plane, go to the dentist--the list is endless. There are many examples of the vast harm that is caused when individuals forget or ignore the effect their dishonesty can have. The savings and loan scandal, the stock market and junk bond swindles, and, of course, Watergate, have undermined the faith of many Americans in the integrity of political and economic leaders and society as a whole. Such incidents take a tremendous toll on our nation's economy and our individual well-being. For example, but for the savings and loan debacle, there might be funds available to reduce the national debt and pay for education.
　　　In sum, we all have a common stake in our school, our community, and our society. Our actions do matter. It is essential that we act with integrity in order to build the kind of world in which we want to live.

Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four chokes marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　　Boys' schools are the perfect place to teach young men to express their emotions and involve them in activities such as art, dance and music.
　　　Far from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity (阳刚), the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to conform to a stereotype. a US study says.
　　　Boys at single-sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their emotional expressiveness, rather than feeling they had to conform to the "boy code" of hiding their emotions to be a "real man".
　　　The findings of the study so against received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls.
　　　Tony Little, headmaster of Eton, warned that boys were being faded by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls. He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls.
　　　The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their female peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills.
　　　But in single-sex schools teachers can tailor lessons to boys' learning style, letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom, wrote the study's author, Abigail James, of the University of Virginia.
　　　Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with "boy-focused" approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them. Because boys generally have more acute vision learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given "hands-on" lessons where they are allowed to walk around. "Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine (女性的) and prefer the modem genre (类型) in which violence and sexism are major themes, "James wrote.
　　　Single-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to conform to a stereotype that men should be "masterful and in charge" in relationships. "In mixed schools boys feel compelled to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means, " the study reported.

A) force boys to hide their emotions to be "real men"

58. It is commonly believed that in a mixed school boys __________.
A) Perform relatively better                                 C) behave more responsibly
B) grow up more healthily                                  D) receive a better education
59. What does Tony Little say about the British education system?
A) It fails more boys than girls academically.
B) It focuses more on mixed school education.
C) It fails to give boys the attention they need.
D) It places more pressure on boys than on girls.
60. According to Abigail James, one of the advantages of single-sex schools is __________.
A) teaching can be tailored to suit the characteristics of boys
B) boys can focus on their lessons without being distracted
C) boys can choose to learn whatever they are interested in
D) teaching can be designed to promote boys' team spirit
61. Which of the following is characteristic of boys according to Abigail James' report?
A) They enjoy being in charge.                                   C) They have sharper vision.
B) They conform to stereotypes.                           D) They are violent and sexist.
 
Passage Two
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
　　　It's an annual argument. Do we or do we not go on holiday? My partner says no because the boiler could go, or the roof fall off and we have no savings to save us. I say you only live once and we work hard and what's the point if you can't go on holiday. The joy of a recession means no argument next year - we just won't go.
　　　Since money is known to be one of the things most likely to bring a relationship to its knees, we should be grateful. For many families the recession means more than not booking a holiday A YouGov poll of 2, 000 people found 22% said they were arguing more with their partners because of concerns about money. What's less clear is whether divorce and separation rates rise in a recession – financial pressures mean couples argue more but make splitting up less affordable. A recent research shows arguments about money were especially damaging to couples. Disputes were characterized by intense verbal (言语上的) aggression, tended to be repeated and not resolved and made men, more than women, extremely angry.
　　　Kim Stephenson, an occupational psychologist, believes money is such a big deal because of what it symbolizes, which may be different things to men and women. "People can say the same things about money but have different ideas of what it's for." he explains. "They'll say it's to save to spend, for security, for freedom, to show someone you love them." He says men are more likely to see money as a way of buying status and of showing their parents that they've achieved something.
　　　"The biggest problem is that couples assume each other know what's going on with their finances, but they don't. There seems to be more of a taboo (禁忌) about talking about money than about death. But you both need to know what you're doing, who's paying what into the joint account and how much you keep separately. In a healthy relationship, you don't have to agree about money, but you have to talk about it."

Small Schools Rising
　　This year’s list of the top 100 high schools shows that today, those with fewer students are flourishing.
　　Fifty years ago, they were the latest thing in educational reform: big, modern, suburban high schools with students counted in the thousands. As baby boomers(二战后婴儿潮时期出生的人) came of high-school age, big schools promised economic efficiency. A greater choice of courses, and, of course, better football teams. Only years later did we understand the trade-offs this involved: the creation of excessive bureaucracies(官僚机构)，the difficulty of forging personal connections between teachers and students.SAT scores began dropping in 1963;today,on average,30% of students do not complete high school in four years, a figure that rises to 50% in poor urban neighborhoods. While the emphasis on teaching to higher, test-driven standards as set in No Child Left Behind resulted in significantly better performance in elementary(and some middle)schools, high schools for a variety of reasons seemed to have made little progress.
　　Size isn’t everything, but it does matter, and the past decade has seen a noticeable countertrend toward smaller schools. This has been due ,in part ,to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has invested $1.8 billion in American high schools, helping to open about 1,000 small schools-most of them with about 400 kids each with an average enrollment of only 150 per grade, About 500 more are on the drawing board. Districts all over the country are taking notice, along with mayors in cities like New York, Chicago and San Diego. The movement includes independent public charter schools, such as No.1 BASIS in Tucson, with only 120 high-schoolers and 18 graduates this year. It embraces district-sanctioned magnet schools, such as the Talented and Gifted School, with 198 students, and the Science and Engineering Magnet,with383,which share a building in Dallas, as well as the City Honors School in Buffalo, N.Y., which grew out of volunteer evening seminars for students. And it includes alternative schools with students selected by lottery(抽签)，such as H-B Woodlawn in Arlington, Va. And most noticeable of all, there is the phenomenon of large urban and suburban high schools that have split up into smaller units of a few hundred, generally housed in the same grounds that once boasted thousands of students all marching to the same band.
　　Hillsdale High School in San Mateo, Calif, is one of those, ranking No.423—among the top 2% in the country—on Newsweek’s annual ranking of America’s top high schools. The success of small schools is apparent in the listings. Ten years ago, when the first Newsweek list based on college-level test participation was published, only three of the top 100 schools had graduating Classes smaller than 100 students. This year there are 22. Nearly 250 schools on the full ,Newsweek list of the top 5% of schools nationally had fewer than 200 graduates in 2007.
　　Although many of Hillsdale’s students came from wealthy households, by the late 1990 average test scores were sliding and it had earned the unaffectionate nickname (绰号) “Hillsjail. ” Jeff Gilbert. A Hillsdale teacher who became principal last year, remembers sitting with other teachers watching students file out of a graduation ceremony and asking one another in astonishment, “How did that student graduate?”
　　So in 2003 Hillsdale remade itself into three “houses,” romantically named Florence, Marrakech and Kyoto. Each of the 300 arriving ninth graders are randomly(随机地) assigned to one of the houses. Where they will keep the same four core subject teachers for two years, before moving on to another for 11th and 12th grades. The closeness this system cultivates is reinforced by the institution of “advisory” classes Teachers meet with students in groups of 25, five mornings a week, for open-ended discussions of everything from homework problems to bad Saturday-night dates. The advisers also meet with students privately and stay in touch with parents, so they are deeply invested in the students’ success.“We’re constantly talking about one another’s advisers,” says English teacher Chris Crockett. “If you hear that yours isn’t doing well in math, or see them sitting outside the dean’s office, it’s like a personal failure.” Along with the new structure came a more demanding academic program, the percentage of freshmen taking biology jumped from 17 to 95.“It was rough for some. But by senior year, two-thirds have moved up to physics,” says Gilbert “Our kids are coming to school in part because they know there are adults here who know them and care for them.”But not all schools show advances after downsizing, and it remains to be seen whether smaller schools will be a cure-all solution.
　　The Newsweek list of top U.S. high schools was made this year, as in years past, according to a single metric, the proportion of students taking college-level exams. Over the years this system has come in for its share of criticism for its simplicity. But that is also its strength: it’s easy for readers to understand, and to do the arithmetic for their own schools if they’d like.
　　Ranking schools is always controversial, and this year a group of 38 superintendents(地区教育主管)from five states wrote to ask that their schools be excluded from the calculation.“It is impossible to know which high schools are ‘the best’ in the nation, ”their letter read. in part. “Determining whether different schools do or don’t offer a high quality of education requires a look at man different measures, including students’ overall academic accomplishments and their subsequent performance in college. And taking into consideration the unique needs of their communities.”
　　In the end, the superintendents agreed to provide the data we sought, which is, after all, public information. There is, in our view, no real dispute here, we are all seeking the same thing, which is schools that better serve our children and our nation by encouraging students to tackle tough subjects under the guidance of gifted teachers. And if we keep working toward that goal, someday, perhaps a list won’t be necessary.

　　Section B
　　Directions: there are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C) and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on
　　　Answer Sheer 2 with a single line through the centre.
　　　
　　Passage One
　　Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　In times of economic crisis. Americans turn to their families for support. If the Great Depression is any guide, we may see a drop in our skyhigh divorce rate. But this won’t necessarily represent. an increase in happy marriages. In the long run, the Depression weakened American families, and the current crisis will probably do the same.
　　We tend to think of the Depression as a time when families pulled together to survive huge job losses, By 1932. when nearly one-quarter of the workforce was unemployed, the divorce rate had declined by around 25% from 1929 But this doesn’t mean people were suddenly happier with their marriages. Rather, with incomes decreasing and insecure jobs, unhappy couples often couldn’t afford to divorce. They feared neither spouse could manage alone.
　　Today, given the job losses of the past year, fewer unhappy couples will risk starting separate households, Furthermore, the housing market meltdown will make it more difficult for them to finance their separations by selling their homes.
　　After financial disasters family members also tend to do whatever they can to help each other and their communities, A 1940 book. The Unemployed Man and His Family, described a family in which the husband initially reacted to losing his job “with tireless search for work.”He was always active, looking for odd jobs to do.
　　The problem is that such an impulse is hard to sustain Across the country, many similar families were unable to maintain the initial boost in morale(士气). For some, the hardships of life without steady work eventually overwhelmed their attempts to keep their families together. The divorce rate rose again during the rest of the decade as the recovery took hold.
　　Millions of American families may now be in the initial stage of their responses to the current crisis, working together and supporting one another through the early months of unemployment.
　　Today’s economic crisis could well generate a similar number of couples whose relationships have been irreparably(无法弥补地)ruined. So it’s only when the economy is healthy again that we’ll begin to see just how many broken families have been created.

　　Passage Two
　　　Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage:
　　　
　　People are being lured (引诱)onto Facebook with the promise of a fun, free service without realizing they’re paying for it by giving up toads of personal information. Facebook then attempts to make money by selling their data to advertisers that want to send targeted messages.
　　Most Facebook users don’t realize this is happening. Even if they know what the company is up to, they still have no idea what they’re paying for Face book because people don’t really know what their personal data is worth.
　　The biggest problem, however, is that the company keeps changing the rules Early on you keep everything private. That was the great thing about facebook you could create own little private network. Last year. The company changed its privacy rules so that many things you city. Your photo, your friends’ names-were set, by default (默认)to be shared with every one on the Internet.
　　According to Facebook’s vice-president Elliot Schrage, the company is simply making changes to improve its service, and if people don’t share information They have a “less satisfying experience”.
　　Some critics think this is more about Facebook looking to make more money. In original business model, which involved selling ads and putting then At the side of the pages totally Who wants to took at ads when they’re online connecting with their friends?
　　The privacy issue has already landed Facebook in hot water in Washington. In April. Senator Charles Schumer called on Facebook to change its privacy policy. He also urged the Federal Trade Commission to set guidelines for social-networking sites.“I think the senator rightly communicated that we had not been clear about what the new products were and how people could choose to use them or not to use them,” Schrage admits.
　　I suspect that whatever Facebook has done so far to invade our privacy, it’s only the beginning. Which is why I’m considering deactivating(撤销)my account. Facebook is a handy site, but I’m upset by the idea that my information is in the hands of people I don’t That’s too high a price to pay.

　　Because conflict and disagreements are part of all close relationships, couples need to learn strategies for managing conflict in a healthy and constructive way. Some couples just 67 and deny the presence of any conflict in a relationship. 68 ,denying the existence of conflict results in couples 69 to solve their problems at early 70 ,which can then lead to even greater problems later 71 .Not surprisingly, expressing anger and disagreement leads to lower marital (婚姻的)satisfaction at the beginning. However, this pattern of behavior 72 increases in marital satisfaction over time. Research suggests that working 73 conflicts is an important predictor of marital satisfaction.
　　So, what can you do to manage conflict in your own relationships? First, try to understand the other person’s point of view 74 put yourself in his of her place. People who are 75 to what their partner thinks and feels 76 greater relationship satisfaction.

　　Second, because conflict and disagreements are an 80 part of close relationships. People need to be able to apologize to their partner for wrongdoing and 81 forgiveness from their parents for their own acts. Apologies minimize conflict, lead to forgiveness, and serve to restore relationship closeness. In line 82 this view, spouses who are more forgiving show higher mental 83 over time. Increasingly, apologizing can even have 84 health benefits. For example, when people reflect on hurtful 85 and grudges(怨恨)，they show negative physiological(生理的) effects, including 86 heart rate and blood pressure, compared to when they reflect on sympathetic perspective-taking and forgiving.

The Magician
The revolution that Steve Jobs led is only just beginning
　　　When it came to putting on a show, nobody else in the computer industry, or any other industry for that matter, could match Steve Jobs. His product launches, at which he would stand alone on a black stage and produce as if by magic an “incredible” new electronic gadget (小器具) in front of an amazed crowd, were the performances of a master showman. All computers do is fetch and work with numbers, he once explained, but do it fast enough and “the results appear to be magic”. Mr Jobs, who died recently aged 56, spent his life packaging that magic into elegantly designed, easy-to-use products.
　　　The reaction to his death, with people leaving candles and flowers outside Apple stores and politicians singing praises on the internet, is proof that Mr Jobs had become something much more significant than just a clever money-maker. He stood out in three ways-as a technologist, as a corporate (公司的) leader and as somebody who was able to make people love what had previously been impersonal, functional gadgets. Strangely, it is this last quality that may have the deepest effect on the way people live. The era of personal technology is in many ways just beginning.
　　As a technologist, Mr Jobs was different because he was not an engineer-and that was his great strength. Instead he was keenly interested in product design and aesthetics (美学), and in making advanced technology simple to use. He repeatedly took an existing but half-formed idea-the mouse-driven computer, the digital music player, the smartphone, the tablet computer (平板电脑) — and showed the rest of the industry how to do it properly. Rival firms competed with each other to follow where he led. In the process he brought about great changes in computing, music, telecoms and the news business that were painful for existing firms but welcomed by millions of consumers.
　　　Within the wider business world, a man who liked to see himself as a hippy (嬉皮士), permanently in revolt against big companies, ended up being hailed by many of those corporate giants as one of the greatest chief executives of his time. That was partly due to his talents: showmanship, strategic vision, an astonishing attention to detail and a dictatorial management style which many bosses must have envied. But most of all it was the extraordinary trajectory (轨迹)of his life. His fall from grace in the 1980s, followed by his return to Apple in 1996 after a period in the wilderness, is an inspiration to any businessperson whose career has taken a turn for the worse. The way in which Mr Jobs revived the failing company he had co-founded and turned it into the world’s biggest tech firm (bigger even than Bill Gates’s Microsoft, the company that had outsmarted Apple so dramatically in the 1980s), sounds like something from a Hollywood movie.
　　　But what was perhaps most astonishing about Mr Jobs was the absolute loyalty he managed to inspire in customers. Many Apple users feel themselves to be part of a community, with Mr Jobs as its leader. And there was indeed a personal link. Apple’s products were designed to accord with the boss’s tastes and to meet his extremely high standards. Every iPhone or MacBook has his fingerprints all over it. His great achievement was to combine an emotional spark with computer technology, and make the resulting product feel personal. And that is what put Mr Jobs on the right side of history, as technological innovation (创新)has moved into consumer electronics over the past decade.
　　　As our special report in this issue (printed before Mr Jobs’s death) explains, innovation used to spill over from military and corporate laboratories to the consumer market, but lately this process has gone into reverse. Many people’s homes now have more powerful, and more flexible, devices than their offices do; consumer gadgets and online services are smarter and easier to use than most companies’ systems. Familiar consumer products are being adopted by businesses, government and the armed forces. Companies are employing in-house versions of Facebook and creating their own “app stores” to deliver software to employees. Doctors use tablet computers for their work in hospitals. Meanwhile, the number of consumers hungry for such gadgets continues to swell. Apple’s products are now being snapped up in Delhi and Dalian just as in Dublin and Dallas.
　　Mr Jobs had a reputation as a control freak (怪人), and his critics complained that the products and systems he designed were closed and inflexible, in the name of greater ease of use. Yet he also empowered millions of people by giving them access to cutting-edge technology. His insistence on putting users first, and focusing on elegance and simplicity, has become deep-rooted in his own company, and is spreading to rival firms too. It is no longer just at Apple that designers ask: “What would Steve Jobs do?”
　　The gap between Apple and other tech firms is now likely to narrow. This week’s announcement of a new iPhone by a management team led by Tim Cook, who replaced Mr Jobs as chief executive in August, was generally regarded as competent but uninspiring. Without Mr Jobs to shower his star dust on the event, it felt like just another product launch from just another technology firm. At the recent unveiling of a tablet computer by Jeff Bezos of Amazon, whose company is doing the best job of following Apple’s lead in combining hardware, software, content and services in an easy-to-use bundle, there were several attacks at Apple. But by doing his best to imitate Mr Jobs, Mr Bezos also flattered (抬举)him. With Mr Jobs gone, Apple is just one of many technology firms trying to arouse his uncontrollable spirit in new products.
　　Mr Jobs was said by an engineer in the early years of Apple to emit a “reality distortion (扭曲)field”, such were his powers of persuasion. But in the end he created a reality of his own, channeling the magic of computing into products that reshaped entire industries. The man who said in his youth that he wanted to “put a ding in the universe” did just that.

Section B

Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C) and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2 with a single line through the center.

Passage One

Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.

     As you are probably aware, the latest job markets news isn’t good: Unemployment is still more than 9 percent, and new job growth has fallen close to zero. That’s bad for the economy, of course. And it may be especially discouraging if you happen to be looking for a job or hoping to change careers right now. But it actually shouldn’t matter to you nearly as much as you think.
　　　That’s because job growth numbers don’t matter to job hunters as much as job turnover  (人员更替) data. After all, existing jobs open up every day due to promotions, resignations, terminations (解雇), and retirements. (Yes, people are retiring even in this economy.) In both good times and bad, turnover creates more openings than economic growth does. Even in June of 2007, when the economy was still moving ahead, job growth was only 132,000, while turnover was 4.7 million!
　　　And as it turns out, even today — with job growth near zero — over 4 million job hunters are being hired every month.
　　　I don’t mean to imply that overall job growth doesn’t have an impact on one’s ability to land a job. It’s true that if total employment were higher, it would mean more jobs for all of us to choose from (and compete for). And it’s true that there are currently more people applying for each available job opening, regardless of whether it’s a new one or not.
　　　But what often distinguishes those who land jobs from those who don’t is their ability to stay motivated. They’re willing to do the hard work of identifying their valuable skills; be creative about where and how to look; learn how to present themselves to potential employers; and keep going, even after repeated rejections. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that 2.7 million people who wanted and were available for work hadn’t looked within the last four weeks and were no longer even classified as unemployed.
　　　So don’t let the headlines fool you into giving up. Four million people get hired every month in the U.S. You can be one of them.

Passage Two

Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.

     Our risk of cancer rises dramatically as we age. So it makes sense that the elderly should be routinely screened for new tumors — or doesn’t it?
　　　While such vigilant (警觉的) tracking of cancer is a good thing in general, researchers are increasingly questioning whether all of this testing is necessary for the elderly. With the percentage of people over age 65 expected to nearly double by 2050, it’s important to weigh the health benefits of screening against the risks and costs of routine testing.
　　　In many cases, screening can lead to surgeries to remove cancer, while the cancers themselves may be slow-growing and may not pose serious health problems in patients’ remaining years. But the message that everyone must screen for cancer has become so deep-rooted that when health care experts recommended that women under 50 and over 74 stop screening for breast cancer, it caused a riotous reaction among doctors, patients and advocacy groups.
　　　It’s hard to uproot deeply held beliefs about cancer screening with scientific data. Certainly, there are people over age 75 who have had cancers detected by routine screening, and gained several extra years of life because of treatment. And clearly, people over age 75 who have other risk factors for cancer, such as a family history or prior personal experience with the disease, should continue to get screened regularly. But for the remainder, the risk of cancer, while increased at the end of life, must be balanced with other factors like remaining life expectancy (预期寿命).
　　　A recent study suggests that doctors start to make more objective decisions about who will truly benefit from screening- especially considering the explosion of the elderly that will soon swell our population.
　　　It’s not an easy calculation to make, but one that makes sense for all patients. Dr. Otis Brawley said, “Many doctors are ordering screening tests purely to cover themselves. We need to think about the rational use of health care.”
　　　That means making some difficult decisions with elderly patients, and going against the misguided belief that when it comes to health care, more is always better.

Suffering in silence
　　　Despite a law designed to protect them, many people with disabling conditions are unaware of their rights. Carole Concha-Bell tells of her experiences.
     Being diagnosed with a disabling condition is always a shock. Learning to live without the guarantee of health is like having to unlearn a previous life. The implications for your working life may seem intimidating.
     There is the disability Discrimination Act (DDA), of course. But does it really provide the protection in the workplace that parliament intended? Are employers merely paying lip service to the DDA? Or are they even aware of an employer’s legal duties and responsibilities?
     In my experience, it is the latter. I have received little support from employers to whom I have revealed my condition. This has often left me feeling at a disadvantage and wondering why I bothered doing so in the first place.
     I had been struggling with illness long before I was diagnosed. In practical terms the diagnosis did little to aid me. Of course, it enabled me to understand my body, my limitations and set me on a course to stabilize my symptoms. But it brought a new dilemma. Where I had previously struggled to work while ill, ignorant of why my body was misbehaving, I now had a name for my daily struggle: Lupus (狼疮). This is a chronic (慢性的), auto-immune disorder that can affect virtually any system in the body. It also leaves a huge, dark question hanging over my head when seeking employment: should I tell my employers I have a condition? It is a dilemma that continues to be a root cause of anxiety both for myself and for thousands of other UK employees.
     The rocky road to my unfortunate enlightenment about work and disability began just after graduation when I’d set my sights on a career in communications and landed my dream job with a respected public relations consultancy (咨询公司) in Bristol. But while I was learning the art of media relations, my body wasn’t quite making it in health terms. I often went to work with swollen limbs and fevers. At my first and last performance review, my boss was amazed that, despite my many capabilities, I hadn’t quite taken control of my responsibilities. A few months later, my contract wasn’t renewed and I plunged further into new depths of ill health.
     However, I was determined not to be beaten and returned to the interview trail. My next job was in publishing. But despite a shining performance at the interview, I felt like a fraud. How long would it be before I sank into ill health and depression again?
     The job was to end with a monumental bang when I became so poorly I could no longer function. A few feverish weeks in bed ended in a specialist appointment, where I was diagnosed with Lupus and rushed into hospital for fear that it may have attacked my internal organs.
     The next 12 months were filled with confusion. I had no idea about benefits, felt alienated (被视为另类) by the medical establishment and lived off my savings until I was broke. I realized I needed help from my family and moved to London.
     As soon as I felt better, I marched into a marketing recruitment consultancy and, within 10 minutes, I had impressed the interviewer enough to be offered a job with the agency. We agreed on a decent salary and I told him had arthritis (关节炎) and would need to work a four-day week.
     Things went well at the start but soon the client meetings began to fall on my day off, and I rarely left the office on time. I began to slip both in health and professional terms. The 10-hour days crashed around my head; no amount of make-up could disguise my ill health as I battled against the odds to prove to myself that I cold still make it in the business world. I often cried on the bus on the way back from work.
     Not long before my contract was due to be made permanent, I was called to the boss’s office and given the “talk” abut how my performance was slipping, how awful I looked. I felt too weak to fight back and agreed to leave. No attempts to offer adjustments to my job, such as being able to work from home, were ever made. I had a case for unfair dismissal under the DDA, but was ignorant of this at the time.
     An estimated 10 million people in UK, or 17% of the population, qualify for disability status under the DDA. I have encountered a number of them: the liver-diseased boss; the co-worker with a heart condition; and my asthmatic (哮喘的) trainee-teacher friend. None had disclosed (透露) their conditions to employers, and all were feeling the strain of not doing so.
     To access your rights under the DDA and to request “reasonable adjustments” to your working conditions or your workplace requires disclosure. I had warned my former employer about my condition but it served little purpose. They were ignorant about their obligations to their disabled staff.
     However, there are plenty of forward-thinking organizations that have inclusive recruitment policies; are more likely to employ a worker with a disability; and are more aware of their legal duties. The public sector out-performs the private, but not always the voluntary, according to studies for the Disabilities Rights Commission.
     I decided to give the voluntary sector a go and was surprised to be offered flexible working conditions and other solutions to meet my needs as an employee. But given the choice, I would still prefer a career in the private sector, which for me is more dynamic, has more attractive salaries and offers better prospects than the voluntary or public sectors.
     Despite the advances of the DDA, there will always be an army of workers who will soldier on, maybe aware of their rights but choosing to remain silent for personal reasons. It is important, though, to recognize the significance of the act, the protection it affords and the obligations that employers have to us as employees and as human beings.

PartⅣ       Reading Comprehension (Reading in Depth)       (25 minutes)

Section A

Direction: In this section, there is a passage with 10 blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word blank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the blank is identified by a letter. Please make the corresponding letter for each item on Answer sheet 2 with a single line through the center. UUUYou may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.

     So many people use the cell phone so frequently every day. But   47   little is certain about the health effects of its use. Manufacturers   48   that cell phones meet government standards for safe radio-frequency radiation emission, but enough studies are beginning to document a possible   49   in rate brain tumors (肿瘤), headaches and behavioral disorders in children to cause concern. So far, the evidence isn’t   50   on whether the use of cell phone   51   to any increased risk of cancer. In a new trial, researchers asked 47 volunteers to   52   in a project to measure glucose (葡萄糖) consumption in the brain by scanning the brain to see how sells use energy. For both 50-minute scans, the volunteers had a cell phone   53   to each ear. During the first scan, the devices were turned off, but for the second scan, the phone on the right ear was   54   on and received a recorded-message call, although the volume was muted (消音) so the noise wouldn’t bias the results. The results of the second scan showed that the   55   of the brain nearest to the device had higher rates of glucose consumption than the rest of the brain. The study shows that cell phones can change brain activity, and   56   a whole new avenue for scientific inquiry, though it doesn’t say anything about whether cell-phone radiation can cause cancer.

Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C) and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2 with a single line through the center.

Passage One

Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.

     It’s no secret that some of the resolutions that many of us vowed to pursue in the new year— eat healthy, lose weight, quit smoking, save more money — have already fallen by the wayside.
     Many of them are likely the same resolutions that we abandoned last January. And it’s a good thing for whose who sell health club memberships, quit-smoking programs and other products that help us think we can improve our lives.
     Many gyms see new memberships double in January, making up for the third of their members who do not renew each year.
     And many who sign up in January will be no-shows by February.
     “If I try one quick fix and it doesn’t work, I may be more likely to try the next quick fix,” Lisa Lahey, who coaches executives how to sustain behavior change, told The Times.
     The Biggest Loser Resort at Fitness Ridge doesn’t offer any quick fixes, just a 12-hour schedule full of exercise, a 1,200-calories-a-day diet and a fee of $2,000 a week. The resort teaches its clients that “weight management” is a combination of fitness, diet and emotional health.
     “Given my recent weight gain, and the fact that I was turning 50,” Jennifer Conlin wrote in The Time, “ I wanted to start a program that would make 2012 the year I finally got in shape.”
     “For years, the advice to eh overweight people has been that we simply need to eat less ad exercise more,” Tara Parker-Pope wrote. “While there is truth to this guidance, it fails to take into account that the human body continues to fight against weight loss long after dieting has stopped. This translates into a sobering (令人清醒的) reality: once we become fat, most of us, despite out best efforts, will probably stay fat.”
     Of course this revelation (揭示), if proven true by further study, is not good news for the weight-loss industry. But chances are it won’t have much impact on the human tendency to resolve to get to the gym more and avoid chocolate cake when the clock strikes midnight on December 31.

Passage Two

Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.

     When University of California-Berkeley released a study this month showing alarmingly high teacher turnover (人员流动) rates at Los Angeles charter schools, I wasn’t surprised.
     That’s not a slam at local charter schools. It’s just that the study echoed something I’d observed many times, starting with my niece.
     Bright and cheerful, my niece longed to teach high-needs children. She started out in the San Francisco public schools, where she was assigned to the district’s toughest elementary school. Fifth-graders threw chairs across the room — and at her. Parents refused to show up for conferences.
     She wasn’t willing to deal with this level of indifference and teacher abuse, so she switched to a highly regarded charger elementary school in the Bay Area where she poured her energy into her job and it showed. Her students’ test scores were high as those in a nearby wealthy school district, despite the obstacles these children faced.
     Yet by her fourth year, my niece was worn out, depleted (耗尽) of the energy it took to work with a classroom of sweet but deeply needy children who pleaded to stay in her classroom when it was time to leave. The principal’s offer of a $10,000 raise couldn’t stop her from giving notice. She went to work at that wealthy school district next door — for less money.
     Over the years, I’ve met many impassioned (充满激情的) teachers at charter schools, only to call them the next year and find they’ve left. The authors of the Berkeley study theorize that the teachers leave because of the extraordinary demands: long hours, intense involvement in students’ complicated lives, continual searches for new ways to raise scores. Even the strongest supporters of the reform movement concede that the task of raising achievement among disadvantaged students is hard work.
     It’s unlikely that we can build large-scale school reform on a platform of continual new demands on teachers — more time, more energy, more devotion, more responsibility — even if schools find ways to pay them better. This is the bigger challenge facing schools. We need a more useful answer to the Berkeley study than “Yea, its really hard work.”

  Like many of the protesters at Occupy Wall Street in New York, Amanda Vodola is young, underemployed and loaded with student debt. She spends her days running around, helping   67   the movement, and her evenings waiting tables at a restaurant in Brooklyn. Last spring, she graduated from Fordham University   68   a degree in English. “I grew up with this narrative that to get a good job I need to go to school,” she says. But the job she has “is not

     In November, when their six-month grace period runs   71  , Vodola and millions of other students who graduated in May have to start   72   their loans. Repayment requirements for private loans kick in regardless of whether   73   have found jobs. Since employment rates for recent college graduates have   74   in the past 

two years, as have starting salaries, the   75   of a sharp rise in student-loan delinquencies (到期未付) has led some economists to   76   that this could be the next financial crisis, rippling (波及) into the wider economy.

For questions 1-7, choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). For questions 8-10, complete the sentences with the information given in the passage.
Should Sugar Be Regulated like Alcohol and Tobacco?
    Sugar poses enough health risks that it should be considered a controlled substance just like alcohol and tobacco, argue a team of researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).
　　　In an opinion piece called “The Toxic (毒性的) Truth About Sugar” published Feb.1 in Nature, Robert Lustig, Laura Schmidt and Claire Brindis argue that it’s wrong to consider sugar just “empty calories.” They write: “There is nothing empty about these calories. A growing body of scientific evidence is showing that fructose (果糖) can trigger processes that lead to liver toxicity and a host of other chronic diseases. A little is not a problem, but a lot kills — slowly.”
　　　Almost everyone’s heard of — or personally experienced — the well-known sugar high, so perhaps the comparison between sugar and alcohol or tobacco shouldn’t come as a surprise. But it’s doubtful that Americans will look favorably upon regulating their favorite vice. We’re a nation that’s sweet on sugar: the average U.S. adult downs 22 teaspoons of sugar a day, according to the American Heart Association, and surveys have found that teens swallow 34 teaspoons.
　　　To counter our consumption, the authors advocate taxing sugary foods and controlling sales to kids under 17. Already, 17% of U.S. children and teens are obese (肥胖), and across the world the sugar intake (摄入) has increased three times in the past 50 years. The increase has helped create a global obesity plague that contributes to 35 million annual deaths worldwide from noninfectious diseases including cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Linda Matzigkeit, a senior vice president at Children’s Healthcare, said “We have to do something about this or our country is in danger. It’s not good if your state has the second-highest obesity rate. Obese children turn into obese adults.”
　　　“There are good calories and bad calories, just as there are good fats and bad fats, good amino acids (氨基酸) and bad amino acids,” Lustig, director of the Weight Assessment for Teen and Child Health program at UCSF, said in a statement. “But sugar is toxic beyond its calories.”
　　　The food industry tries to imply that “a calorie is a calorie is a calorie,” says Kelly Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University. “But this and other research suggests there is something different about sugar,” says Brownell.
　　　The UCSF report emphasizes the metabolic (新陈代谢) effects of sugar. Excess sugar can alter metabolism, raise blood pressure, affect the signaling of hormones and damage the liver — outcomes that sound suspiciously similar to what can happen after a person drinks too much alcohol. Schmidt, co-chair of UCSF’s Community Engagement and Health Policy program, noted on CNN: “When you think about it, this actually makes a lot of sense. Alcohol, after all, is simply made from sugar. Where does vodka come from? Sugar.”
　　　But there are also other areas of impact that researchers have investigated: the effect of sugar on the brain and how liquid calories are interpreted differently by the body than solids. Research has suggested that sugar activates the same reward pathways in the brain as traditional drugs of abuse like morphine or heroin. No one is claiming the effect of sugar is quite that strong, but, says Brownell, “it helps confirm what people tell you sometimes, that they hunger for sugar and have withdrawal symptoms when they stop eating it.”
　　　There’s also something particularly tricky about sugary drinks. “When calories come in liquids, the body doesn’t feel as full,” says Brownell. “People are getting more of their calories than ever before from sugared drinks.”
　　　Other countries, including France, Greece and Denmark, impose soda taxes, and the concept is being considered in at least 20 U.S. cities and states. Last summer, Philadelphia came close to passing a 2-cents-per-ounce soda tax. The Rudd Center has been a strong advocate of a more modest 1-cent-per-punce tax. But at least one study, from 2010, has raised doubts that soda taxes would result in significant weight loss: apparently people who are determined to eat — and drink — unhealthily will find ways to do it. Teens — no surprise — are good at finding ways to get the things they can’t have, so state policies banning all sugar-sweetened drinks from public schools and providing only water, milk or 100% fruit juices haven’t had the intended effect of steering kids away from drinking sugared drinks: the average teen consumes about 300 calories per day — that’s nearly 15% of his daily calories — in sweetened drinks, and the food and drink industry is only too happy to feed this need.
　　　Ultimately, regulating sugar will prove particularly tricky because it goes beyond health concerns; sugar, for so many people, is love. A plate of cut-up vegetables just doesn’t pack the same emotional a cupcake and not an apple as an after-school treat today. We don’t do that regularly — it’s the first time this school year, actually — and that’s what made it special. As a society, could we ever reach the point where we’d think apples — not a cupcake — are something to get excited over? Says Brindis, one of the report’s authors and director of UCSF’s Philip R.Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies: “We recognize that there are cultural and celebratory aspects of sugar. Changing these patterns is very complicated.”
　　　For inroads (进展) to be made, say the authors in their statement, people have to be better educated about the hazards of sugar and agree that something’s got to change:
　　　Many of the interventions (干预) that have reduced alcohol and tobacco consumption can be models for addressing the sugar problem, such as imposing special sales taxes, controlling access, and tightening licensing requirements on vending machines (自动售货机) and snack-bars sell high sugar products in schools and workplaces.
　　　“We’re not talking prohibition,” Schmidt said. “We’re not advocating a major imposition of the government into people’s lives. We’re talking about gentle ways to make sugar consumption slightly less convenient, thereby moving people away from the concentrated does. What we want is to actually increase people’s choices by making foods that aren’t loaded with sugar comparatively easier and cheaper to get.”

Section B

Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C) and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer sheet 2 with a single line through the center.

Passage One

Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.

     I’ve worked in the factories surrounding my hometown every summer since I graduated from high school, but making the transition (转变) between school and full-time blue-collar work during the break never gets any easier. For a student like me who considers any class before noon to be uncivilized, getting to a factory by 6 o’clock each morning is torture. My friends never seem to understand why I’m so relieved to be back at school or that my summer vacation has been anything but a vacation.
     There’re few people as self-confident as a college student who has never been out in the real world. People my age always seem to overestimate the value of their time and knowledge. In fact, all the classes did not prepare me for my battles with the machine I ran in the plant, which would jam whenever I absent-mindedly put in a part backward or upside down.
     The most stressful thing about blue-collar life is knowing your job could disappear overnight. Issues like downsizing (裁员) and overseas relocation had always seemed distant to me until my co-workers told me that the until I was working in would shut down within six months and move to Mexico, where people would work for 60 cents and hour.
      After working 12-hour shifts in a factory, the other options have become only too clear. When I’m back at the university, skipping classes and turning in lazy re-writes seems too irresponsible after seeing what I would be doing without school. All the advice and public-service announcements about the value of an education that used to sound stale now ring true.
     These lessons I’m learning, however valuable, are always tinged (带有) with sense of guilt. Many people pass their lives in the places I briefly work, spending 30 years where I spend only two months at a time. “This job pays well, but it’s hell on the body,” said one co-worker. “Study hard and keep reading,” she added.
     My experiences in the factories have inspired me to make the most of my college years before I enter the real world for good.

Passage Two

Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.

     Are people suffering form gadget (小器具) overload? Are they exhausted by the consumer equivalent of the brain fatigue — information overload — that is caused by constant updates of devices and online media?
     Underwriters Laboratories issued a report last week that found 48% of consumers “feel high-tech manufacturers bring new products to market faster than people need them.”
     There are two possible explanations. The first, obvious one is that the pace of innovation (创新) is too fast for consumers. The second, less obvious one is that, innovation is too slow. That is the new offerings companies are pushing out the door every six months or so are me-too products or ones with just a couple of new features. Marketing schedules, not product innovation, are driving the corporate (公司的) train. Manufacturers in American valued “spend to market” more than in other countries, the report found.
     Sara Greenstein, Underwriters Laboratories’ chief strategy officer, offered her interpretation of the survey results, “Innovation is too fast only if corners are cut.”
     For the high-tech sector, there are a few other interesting finding. Consumers are less concerned about safety in high-tech products than categories like fresh and processed food. But their top safety concerns are emissions and wireless radio waves. Many people, it seems, are uneasy living in a thickening cloud of radio waves from mobile phone towers and the gadgets they communicate with.
     A finding that was a bit surprising is that to consumers, the inner parts of high-tech devices do apparently matter. Some 55% of consumers, according to the report, said they are “more” concerned about high-tech components come from than where the product was assembled.”
     The report doesn’t really say how that information would affect consumer buying decisions. It could be complicated. Manufacturing companies on average rely on more than 35 contract suppliers around the world to create a single product. That number would be higher for a smartphone or laptop.
     But maybe some sort of supply-chain labeling showing where parts come from in a product? “We’re working on it,” Ms. Greenstein said.

Surviving the Recession
　　　America’s recession began quietly at the end of 2007. Since then it has evolved into a global crisis. Reasonable people may disagree about whom to blame. Financiers who were not as clever as they thought they were? Regulators falling asleep at work? Consumers who borrowed too much? Politicians who thoughtlessly promoted home-ownership for those who could not afford it? All are guilty; and what a mess they have created.
　　　Since 2007 America has shed 5 million jobs. More than 15% of the workforce are jobless or underemployed—roughly 25 million workers. The only industries swelling their payrolls are health care, utilities and the federal government. The value of listed shares in American firms collapsed by 57% from its peak in October 2007 to a low in March this year, though it has since bounced back somewhat. Industrial production fell by 12.8% in the year to March, the worst slide since the Second World War. Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody’s Economy.com, predicts that the recession will shrink America’s economy by 3.5% in total. For most executives, this is the worst business environment they’ve ever seen. 
　　　Times are so tough that even bosses are taking pay cuts. Median (中位数的) pay for chief executives of S&P 500 companies fell 6.8% in 2008. The overthrown business giants of Wall Street took the biggest knock, with average pay cuts of 38% and median bonuses of zero. But there was some pain for everyone: median pay for chief executives of non-financial firms in the S&P 500 fell by 2.7%.
　　　Nearly every business has a sad tale to tell. For example, Arne Sorenson, the president of Marriott hotels, likens the crisis to the downturn that hit his business after September 11th, 2001. When the twin towers fell, Americans stopped travelling. Marriott had its worst quarter ever, with revenues per room falling by 25%. This year, without a terrorist attack, the hotel industry is “putting the same numbers on the board”, says Mr Sorenson.
　　　The hotel bust (不景气), like most busts, was preceded by a breathtaking boom. Although many other big firms resisted the temptation to over-borrow, developers borrowed heavily and built bigger and fancier hotels as if the whole world were planning a holiday in Las Vegas. When the bubble burst, demand collapsed. Hotel owners found themselves with a huge number of empty rooms even as a lot of unnecessary new hotels were ready to open.
　　　Other industries have suffered even more. Large numbers of builders, property firms and retailers have gone bankrupt. And a disaster has hit Detroit. Last year the American car industry had the capacity to make 17 million vehicles. Sales in 2009 could be barely half of that. The Big Three American carmakers—General Motors, Ford and Chrysler—accumulated ruinous costs over the post-war years, such as gold-plated health plans and pensions for workers who retired as young as 48. All three are desperately restructuring. Only Ford may survive in its current form.
　　　Hard times breed hard feelings. Few Americans understand what caused the recession. Some are seeking scapegoats (替罪羊). Politicians are happy to take advantage. Bosses have been summoned to Washington to be scolded on live television. The president condemns their greed. 
Extravagance (奢侈) is out
　　　Businessfolk are bending over backwards to avoid seeming extravagant. Meetings at resorts are suddenly unacceptable. Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, cancelled a conference in Las Vegas at the last minute and rebooked it in San Francisco, which cost more but sounded less fun.
　　　Anyway, the pain will eventually end. American business will regain its shine. Many firms will die, but the survivors will emerge leaner and stronger than before. The financial sector’s share of the economy will shrink, and stay shrunk for years to come. The importance of non-financial firms will accordingly rise, along with their ability to attract the best talent. America will remain the best place on earth to do business, so long as Barack Obama and the Democrats in Congress resist the temptation to interfere too much, and so long as organised labour does not overplay its hand.
　　　The crisis will prove hugely disruptive (破坏性的), however. Bad management techniques will be exposed. Necessity will force the swift adoption of more efficient ones. At the same time, technological innovation (创新) will barely pause for breath, and two big political changes seem likely.
　　　Mr Obama’s plan to curb carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions (排放), though necessary, will be far from cost-free, whatever his sunny speeches on the subject might suggest. The shift to a low-carbon economy will help some firms, hurt others and require every organisation that uses much energy to rethink how it operates. It is harder to predict how Mr Obama’s proposed reforms to the failing health-care system will turn out. If he succeeds in curbing costs—a big if—it would be a huge gain for America. Some businesses will benefit but the vast bulk of the savings will be captured by workers, not their employers.
　　　In the next couple of years the businesses that thrive will be those that are tight with costs, careful of debt, cautious with cash flow and extremely attentive to what customers want. They will include plenty of names no one has yet heard of.
　　　Times change, and corporations change with them. In 1955 Time’s Man of the Year was Harlow Curtice, the boss of GM. His firm was leading America towards “a new economic order”, the magazine wrote. Thanks to men like Curtice, “the bonds of scarcity” had been broken and America was rolling “in an all-time high of prosperity”. Soon, Americans would need to spend “comparatively little time earning a living”.
　　　Half a century later GM is a typical example of poor management. In March its chief executive was fired by Time’s current Man of the Year, Mr Obama. The government now backs up the domestic car industry, lending it money and overseeing its turnaround plans. With luck, this will be short-lived. But there is a danger that Washington will end up micromanaging not only Detroit but also other parts of the economy. And clever as Mr Obama’s advisers are, history suggests they will be bad at this.

Questions 47 to 56 are based on the following passage.
　　Just when you had figured out how to manage fat in your diet, researchers are now warning against another common mealtime pitfall (陷阱) —salt.
　　A study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Stanford University and Columbia University shows that even a  47  decrease in daily salt intake (摄入) can lead to dramatic health benefits. The authors  48  an annual drop of as many as 120,000 cases of heart disease, 66,000  49  of stroke and 99,000 heart attacks  50   by high blood pressure after a 3-g-per-day reduction in salt.
　　　The advantages, not surprisingly, were greater for African Americans, who are more likely to 51  high blood pressure than other ethnic groups, and for the elderly, since blood vessels stiffen with age, which can lead to higher blood pressure.
　　　“Everyone in the U.S. is consuming salt far in  52  of what is good for them,” says lead author Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo of UCSF. “What we are suggesting is that a population-wide effort to reduce salt intake, even   53  , will have health benefits. ”
　　　The team conducted a computer-based analysis to determine the   54   of a 3-g-per-day reduction in salt intake on rates of heart disease and death. They also calculated the cost savings emerging from the amount of disease that would be  55  because of lower blood pressure. The conclusion: by cutting salt intake nationwide, the U.S. could save $10 billion to $24 billion  56  in health care costs.

Section B
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage.
　　　The Gatais used to frown when they received power bills that routinely topped $200. Last September the couple moved into a 1,500-square-foot home in Premier Gardens, a subdivision of 95 “zero-energy homes” (ZEH) just outside town. Now they’re actually eager to see their electricity bills. The grand total over the 10 months they’ve lived in the three-bedroom house: $75. For the past two months they haven’t paid a cent.
　　　ZEH communities are the leading edge of technologies that might someday create houses that produce as much energy as they consume. Premier Gardens is one of a half-dozen subdivisions in California where every home cuts power consumption by 50%, mostly by using low-power appliances and solar panels.
　　　Aside from the panels on the roof, Premier Gardens looks like a community of conventional homes. But inside, special windows cut power bills by blocking solar heat in summer and retaining indoor warmth in winter.
　　　The rest of the energy savings comes from the solar units. They don’t just feed the home they serve. If they generate more power than the home is using, the excess flows into the utility’s power grid (电网). The residents are billed by “net metering”: they pay for the amount of power they tap off the grid, less the kilowatts (千瓦) they feed into it. If a home generates more power than it uses, the bill is zero.
　　　That sounds like a bad deal for the power company, but it’s not. Solar homes produce the most power on the hot sunny afternoons when everyone rushes home to turn up the air conditioner. “It helps us lower usage at peak power times,” says solar expert Mike Keesee. “That lets us avoid building costly plants or buying expensive power at peak usage time.”
　　　What’s not to like? Mostly the costs. The special features can add $25,000 or more to the purchase price of a house. Tax breaks bring the cost down, especially in California, but in many states ZEHs can be prohibitively expensive. For the consumer, it’s a matter of paying now for the hardware to save later on the utilities.

59. How are the residents in the ZEH communities billed for electricity use?
A) They are only charged for the amount of power they consume on rainy days.
B) They needn’t pay a single cent for their power consumption on sunny days.
C) They only pay for the excess power that flows into the utility’s power grid.
D) They pay for the electricity from the grid less their home-generated power.
60. What does the “net metering” practice mean to the power company?
   A) More pressure at peak time.            C) Increased electricity output.

61. The author believes that buying a house in a ZEH community ____________.
A) is but a dream for average consumers
B) gives the owner substantial tax benefits

Passage Two
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage.
     Romantic love has clear evolutionary roots but our views about what makes an ideal romantic relationship can be swayed by the society we live in. So says psychologist Maureen O’Sullivan from the University of San Francisco. She suggests that humans have always tried to strengthen the pair-bond to maximise(使最大化) reproductive success.
     Many societies throughout history and around the world today have cultivated strong pressures to stay married. In those where ties to family and community are strong, lifelong marriages can be promoted by practices such as the cultural prohibition of divorce and arranged marriages that are seen as a contract between two families, not just two individuals. In modern western societies, however, the focus on individuality and independence means that people are less concerned about conforming to (遵守) the dictates of family and culture. In the absence of societal pressures to maintain pair-bonds, O’Sullivan suggests that romantic love has increasingly come to be seen as the factor that should determine who we stay with and for how long. “That’s why historically we see an increase in romantic love as a basis for forming long-term relationships,” she says.
　　　According to O’Sullivan culture also shapes the sorts of feelings we expect to have, and actually do experience, when in love. Although the negative emotions associated with romantic love—fear of loss, disappointment and jealousy—are fairly consistent across cultures, the positive feelings can vary. “If you ask Japanese students to list the positive attributes they expect in a romantic partner, they rate highly things like loyalty, commitment and devotion,” says O’Sullivan. “If you ask American college women, they expect everything under the sun: in addition to being committed, partners have to be amusing, funny and a friend.”
　　　We judge a potential partner according to our specific cultural expectations about what romantic love should feel like. If you believe that you have found true romance, and your culture tells you that this is what a long-term relationship should be based on, there is less need to rely on social or family pressures to keep couples together, O’Sullivan argues.

Directions: There are 20 blanks in the following passage. For each blank there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should choose the ONE that best fits into the passage. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
　　　The work for which Thomas Malthus is still most widely known is his Essay on the Principle of Population, which first appeared in 1798. This book introduced Malthus’s   67   that population inescapably outgrows subsistence (生活资料)，and that this difference   68 population size and the ability to adequately meet the   69   subsistence needs of all of the members of that population “naturally” produces a fundamental struggle for   70  , in which some flourish at the   71   of others.
　　　Charles Darwin’s most important contribution   72   the field of biology, described in his work, On the Origin of Species, was to  73   Malthus’s observation that plants and animals multiply faster than nature can provide for them to his own   74   of the process of “evolution”—the notion that different forms of life develop   75   from a common ancestry (祖先). Combining these elements, Darwin   76   that the factors of “the struggle for existence” and “the survival of the fittest” are the central mechanisms   77   which evolution is based. In this sense, then, Darwin introduced the possibility   78   conflict and struggle are biological phenomena, which are   79   central to human social existence.
　　　A number of more contemporary social thinkers were   80   by Darwin and continued this particular version of the conflict perspective, commonly referred to   81   social Darwinism, into the twentieth century. Thus, for example, Herbert Spencer, a   82   English social theorist, applied these ideas of the natural   83   of conflict and survival of the fittest to his notion of social evolution,   84   William Graham Sumner, an American sociologist, saw the   85   for survival among individual actors as operating to bring about fundamental   86   in the quality of human social life overall.

Can Digital Textbook Truly Replace the Print Kind?
　　The shortcomings of traditional print edition textbooks are obvious: For starters they’re heavy, with the average physics textbook weighing 3.6 pounds. They’re also expensive, especially when you factor in the average college student’s limited budget, typically costing hundreds of dollars every semester. 
　　But the worst part is that print version of textbooks are constantly undergoing revisions. Many professors require that their students use only the latest versions in the classroom, essentially rendering older texts unusable. For students, it means they’re basically stuck with a four pound paper-weight that they can’t sell back. 
　　Which is why digital textbooks, if they live up to their promise, could help ease many of these shortcomings. But till now, they’ve been something like a mirage（幻影）in the distance, more like a hazy（模糊的）dream than an actual reality. Imagine the promise: Carrying all your textbooks in a 1.3 pound iPad? It sounds almost too good to be true. 
　　But there are a few pilot schools already making the transition（过渡）over to digital books. Universities like Cornell and Brown have jumped onboard. And one medical program at the University of California, Irvine, gave their entire class iPads with which to download textbooks just last year. 
　　But not all were eager to jump aboard. 
　　“People were tired of using the iPad textbook besides using it for reading,” says Kalpit Shah, who will be going into his second year at Irvine’s medical program this fall. “They weren’t using it as a source of communication because they couldn’t read or write in it. So a third of the people in my program were using the iPad in class to take notes, the other third were using laptops and the last third were using paper and pencil.” 
　　The reason it hasn’t caught on yet, he tells me, is that the functionality of e-edition textbooks is incredibly limited, and some students just aren’t motivated to learn new study behavior. 
　　But a new application called Inkling might change all that. The company just released an updated version last week, and it’ll be utilized in over 50 undergraduate and graduate classrooms this coming school year. 
　　“Digital textbooks are not going to catch on,” says Inkling CEO Matt Maclnnis as he’s giving me a demo（演示）over coffee. “What I mean by that is the current perspective of the digital textbook is it’s an exact copy of the print book. There’s Course Smart, etc., these guys who take any image of the page and put it on a screen. If that’s how we’re defining digital textbooks, there’s no hope of that becoming a mainstream product.” 
　　He calls Inkling a platform for publishers to build rich multimedia content from the ground up, with a heavy emphasis on real-world functionality. The traditional textbook merely serves as a skeleton. 
　　At first glance Inkling is an impressive experience. After swiping（敲击）into the iPad app (应用软件 ), which you can get for free here, he opens up a few different types of textbooks. 
　　Up first is a chemistry book. The boot time is pretty fast, and he navigates through (浏览 ) a few chapters before swiping into a fully rendered 3D molecule that can be spun around to view its various building blocks. “Publishers give us all of the source media, artwork, videos,” he says, “We help them think through how to actually build something for this platform.” 
　　Next he pulls up a music composition textbook, complete with playable demos. It’s a learning experience that attacks you from multiple sensory directions. It’s clear why this would be something a music major would love. 
　　But the most exciting part about Inkling, to me, is its notation（批注）system. Here’s how it works! 
　　When you purchase a used print book, it comes with its previous owner’s highlights and notes in the margins. It uses the experience of someone who already went through the class to help improve your reading (how much you trust each notation is obviously up to you). 
　　But with lnkling, you can highlight a piece of content and make notes. Here’s where things get interesting, though: If a particularly important passage is highlighted by multiple lnkling users, that information is stored on the cloud and is available for anyone reading the same textbook to come across. That means users have access to notes from not only their classmates and Facebook friends, but anyone who purchased the book across the country. The best comments are then sorted democratically by a voting system, meaning that your social learning experience is shared with the best and brightest thinkers. 
　　As a bonus, professors can even chime in (插话 ) on discussions. They’ll be able to answer the questions of students who are in their class directly via the interactive book. 
　　Of course, Inkling addresses several of the other shortcomings in traditional print as well. Textbook versions are constanly updated, motivating publishers by minimizing production costs (the big ones like McGraw-Hill are already onboard). Furthermore, students will be able to purchase sections of the text instead of buying the whole thing, with individual chapters costing as little as $2.99. 
　　There are, however, challenges. 
　　“It takes efforts to build each book,” Maclnnis tells me. And it’s clear why. 
　　Each interactive textbook is a media-heavy experience built from the ground up, and you can tell that it takes a respectable amount of manpower to put together each one. 
　　For now the app is also iPad-exclusive, and though a few of these educational institutions are giving the hardware away for free, for other students who don’t have such a luxury it’s an added layer of cost — and an expensive one at that. 
　　But this much is clear. The traditional textbook model is and has been broken for quite some time. Whether digitally interactive ones like Inkling actually take off or not remains to be seen, and we probably won’t have a definite answer for the next few years. 
　　However the solution to any problem begins with a step in a direction. And at least for now, that hazy mirage in the distance? A little more tangible (可触摸的 ), a little less of a dream.

You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. 
Passage One 
Questions 57 to 61 are based on the following passage. 
　　Junk food is everywhere. We’re eating way too much of it. Most of us know what we’re doing and yet we do it anyway. 
　　So here’s a suggestion offered by two researchers at the Rand Corporation: Why not take a lesson from alcohol control policies and apply them to where food is sold and how it’s displayed? 
　　“Many policy measures to control obesity（肥胖症）assume that people consciously and rationally choose what and how much they eat and therefore focus on providing information and more access to healthier foods,” note the two researchers. 
　　“In contrast,” the researchers continue, “many regulations that don’t assume people make rational choices have been successfully applied to control alcohol, a substance — like food — of which immoderate consumption leads to serious health problems.” 
　　The research references studies of people’s behavior with food and alcohol and results of alcohol restrictions, and then lists five regulations that the researchers think might be promising if applied to junk foods. Among them: 
　　Density restrictions: licenses to sell alcohol aren’t handed out unplanned to all comers but are allotted（分配）based on the number of places in an area that already sell alcohol. These make alcohol less easy to get and reduce the number of psychological cues to drink. 
　　Similarly, the researchers say, being presented with junk food stimulates our desire to eat it. So why not limit the density of food outlets, particularly ones that sell food rich in empty calories? And why not limit sale of food in places that aren’t primarily food stores? 
　　Display and sales restrictions: California has a rule prohibiting alcohol displays near the cash registers in gas stations, and in most places you can’t buy alcohol at drive-through facilities. At supermarkets, food companies pay to have their wares in places where they’re easily seen. One could remove junk food to the back of the store and ban them from the shelves at checkout lines. The other measures include restricting portion sizes, taxing and prohibiting special price deals for junk foods, and placing warning labels on the products. 

57. What does the author say about junk food? 
　　A) People should be educated not to eat too much. 
　　B) It is widely consumed despite its ill reputation. 
　　C) Its temptation is too strong for people to resist. 
　　D) It causes more harm than is generally realized. 
58. What do the Rand researchers think of many of the policy measures to control obesity? 
　　A) They should be implemented effectively. 
　　B) They provide misleading information. 
　　C) They are based on wrong assumptions. 
　　D) They help people make rational choices. 
59. Why do policymakers of alcohol control place density restrictions? 
　　A) Few people are able to resist alcohol’s temptations. 
　　B) There are already too many stores selling alcohol. 
　　C) Drinking strong alcohol can cause social problems. 
　　D) Easy access leads to customers’ over-consumption. 
60. What is the purpose of California’s rule about alcohol display in gas stations? 
　　A) To effectively limit the density of alcohol outlets. 
　　B) To help drivers to give up the habit of drinking. 
　　C) To prevent possible traffic jams in nearby areas. 
　　D) To get alcohol out of drivers’ immediate sight. 
61. What is the general guideline the Rand researchers suggest about junk food control? 
　　A) Guiding people to make rational choices about food. 
　　B) Enhancing people’s awareness of their own health. 
　　C) Borrowing ideas from alcohol control measures. 
　　D) Resorting to economic, legal and psychological means. 
Passage Two 
Questions 62 to 66 are based on the following passage. 
　　Kodak’s decision to file for bankruptcy（破产）protection is a sad, though not unexpected, turning point for a leading American corporation that pioneered consumer photography and dominated the film market for decades, but ultimately failed to adapt to the digital revolution. 
　　Although many attribute Kodak’s downfall to “complacency(自满) ,” that explanation doesn’t acknow-ledge the lengths to which the company went to reinvent itself. Decades ago, Kodak anticipated that digital photography would overtake film — and in fact, Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 — but in a fateful decision, the company chose to shelf its new discovery to focus on its traditional film business. 
　　It wasn’t that Kodak was blind to the future, said Rebecca Henderson, a professor at Harvard Business School, but rather that it failed to execute on a strategy to confront it. By the time the company realized its mistake, it was too late. 
　　Kodak is an example of a firm that was very much aware that they had to adapt, and spent a lot of money trying to do so, but ultimately failed. Large companies have a difficult time switching into new markets because there is a temptation to put existing assets into the new businesses. 
　　Although Kodak anticipated the inevitable rise of digital photography, its corporate（企业的） culture was too rooted in the successes of the past for it to make the clean break necessary to fully embrace the future. They were a company stuck in time. Their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability. 
　　Kodak’s downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. In 1976, the company commanded 90% of the market for photographic film and 85% of the market for cameras. But the 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which undermined Kodak by offering lower prices for film and photo supplies. Kodak’s decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major miscalculation. The bid went instead to Fuji, which exploited its sponsorship to win a permanent foothold in the marketplace. 
　　
62. What do we learn about Kodak? 
　　A) It went bankrupt all of a sudden. 
　　B) It is approaching its downfall. 
　　C) It initiated the digital revolution in the film industry. 
　　D) It is playing a dominant role in the film market. 
63. Why does the author mention Kodak’s invention of the first digital camera? 
　　A) To show its early attempt to reinvent itself. 
　　B) To show its effort to overcome complacency. 
　　C) To show its quick adaptation to the digital revolution. 
　　D) To show its will to compete with Japan’s Fuji photo. 
64. Why do large companies have difficulty switching to new markets? 
　　A) They find it costly to give up their existing assets. 
　　B) They tend to be slow in confronting new challenges. 
　　C) They are unwilling to invest in new technology. 
　　D) They are deeply stuck in their glorious past. 
65. What does the author say Kodak’s history has become? 
　　A) A burden.  
　　B) A mirror.  
　　C) A joke.  
　　D) A challenge.  
66. What was Kodak’s fatal mistake?  
　　A) Its blind faith in traditional photography.  
　　B) Its failure to see Fuji photo’s emergence.  
　　C) Its refusal to sponsor the 1984 Olympics.  
　　D) Its overconfidence in its corporate culture.  
　　
Part V Cloze (15 minutes)  

Directions: There are 20 blanks in the following passage. For each blank there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should choose the ONE that best fits into the passage. Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

And, most   71  , a 2007 study of nearly 24,000 Greek adults in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that people who napped   72   had a 37 percent reduced risk of dying   73   heart disease compared to people who didn’t nap.  
　　Of course, napping isn’t   74   for everyone. If you’re suffering from inability to sleep, naps that are too long or taken too late in the day can   75   with your ability to fall or stay asleep at night.

　　Surprisingly, the best place to take a nap may be a hammock（吊床）if you have one. A Swiss study   84   last year found that people fell asleep faster and had deeper sleep when they napped in a hammock than in a bed. That same rocking   85   that puts babies to sleep works 86   for grown-ups, too.

Can Digital Textbooks Truly Replace the Print Kind?
A． The shortcomings of traditional print edition textbooks are obvious: For starters they're heavy, with the average physics textbook weighing 3.6 pounds. They're also expensive, especially when you factor in the average college student's limited budget, typically costing hundreds of dollars every semester. But the worst part is that print versions of textbooks are constantly undergoing revisions. Many professors require that their students use only the latest versions in the classroom, essentially rendering older texts unusable. For students, it means they're basically stuck with a four pound paperweight that they Can't sell back.
B． Which is why digital textbooks, if they live up to their promise, could help ease many of these shortcomings. But till now, they've been something like a mirage (幻影) in the distance, more like a hazy (模糊的) dream than an actual reality. Imagine the promise: Carrying all your textbooks in a 1.3 pound iPad ? It Sounds almost too good to be true. But there are a few pilot schools already making the transition (过渡) over to digital books. Universities like Cornell. and Brown have jumped onboard. And one medical program at the University of California, Irvine, gave their entire class iPads with which to download textbooks just last year.
 C． But not all were eager to jump aboard. "People were tired of using the iPad textbook besides using it for reading," says Kalpit Shah, who will be going into his second year at Irvine's medical program this fall. "They weren't using it as a source of communication because they couldn't read or write in it. So a third of the-people in my program were using the iPad in class to take notes, the other third were using laptops and the last third were using paper and pencil." The reason it hasn't caught on yet, he tells me, is that the functionality of e-edition textbooks is incredibly limited, and some students just aren't motivated to learn new study behavior.
D． But a new application called Inlding might change all that. The company just released an updated version last week, and it'll be utilized in over 50 undergraduate and graduate classrooms this coming school year. "Digital textbooks are not going to catch on," says Inkling CEO Matt MacInnis as he's giving me a demo (演示) over coffee. "What I mean by that is the current perspective of the digital textbook is it's an exact copy of the print book. There's Course Smart, etc., these guys who take an image of the page and put it on a screen. If that's how we're defining digital textbooks, there's no hope of that becoming a mainstream product." He calls Inkling a platform for publishers to build rich multimedia content from the ground up, with a heavy emphasis on real-world functionality. The traditional textbook merely serves .as a skeleton.
E． At first glance Inkling is an impressive experience. After swiping (触击) into the iPad app (应用软件), which you can get for free here, he opens up a few different types of textbooks. Up first is a chemistry book. The boot time is pretty fast, and he navigates through (浏览) a few chapters before swiping into afully rendered 3D molecule that can be spun around to view its various building blocks.  "Publishers give us all of the source media, artwork, videos," he says.  "We help them think through how to actually build something for this platform." Next he pulls up a music composition textbook, complete with playable demos. It's a learning experience that attacks you from multiple sensory directions. It's clear why this would be something a music major would love.
F． But the most exciting part about Inkling, to me, is its notation (批注) system. Here's how it works: When you purchase a used print book, it comes with its previous owner's highlights and notes in the margins. It uses the experience of someone who already went through the class to help improve your reading  (how much you trust each notation is obviously up to you). But with Inkling, you can highlight a piece of content and make notes. Here's where things get interesting, though: If a particularly important passage is highlighted by multiple Inkling users, that information is stored on the cloud and is available for anyone reading the same textbook to come across. That means users have access to notes from not only their classmates and Facebook friends, but anyone who purchased the book across the country. The best comments are then Sorted democratically by a voting system, meaning that your social learning experience is shared with the best and brightest thinkers. As a bonus, professors can even chime in (插话) on discussions. They'll be able to answer" the questions of students who are in their class directly via the interactive b6ok.
G． Of course, Inkling addresses Several of the other shortcomings in traditional print, as well. Textbook versions are constantly updated, motivating publishers by minimizing production costs (the big ones like McGraw-Hill are already onboard). Furthermore, students will be able to purchase sections of the text instead of buying the whole thing, with individual chapters costing as little as $2.99.
H． There are, however, challenges.  "It takes efforts to build each book," MacInnis tells me. And it's clear why. Each interactive textbook is a media-heavy experience built from the ground up, and you can tell that it takes a respectable amount of manpower to put together each one. For now the app is also iPad-exclusive, and though a few of these educational institutions are giving the hardware away for free, for other students who don't have such a luxury it's an added layer of cost--and an expensive one at that.
I． But this much is clear: The traditional textbook model is and has been broken for quite some time. Whether digitally interactive ones like Inkling actually take off or not remains to be seen, and we probably won't have a defmite answer for the next few years. However, the solution to any problem begins with a step in a direction. And at. least for now, that hazy mirage in the distance? A little more tangible (可触摸的)， a little less of a dream.
注意：此部分试题请在答题卡2上作答。
46. The updated version of Inkling works as a platform for building multimedia Content.
47. Some students in the medical program at the University of California, Irvine still use paper and pencil in class because they find it troublesome to take notes with an iPad.
48. One of the challenges to build an interactive digital .textbook from the ground up is that it rakes a great .deal of manpower.
49. Though whether digital textbooks will catch on still remain to be seen, the dream has become more tangible.
50. The most interesting part of Inkling's notation system is that one can share his learning experience with the best and brightest thinkers.
51. Students can only buy certain sections of the textbook rather than the whole one, which lessens students' financial burden.
52. The biggest problem with traditional print textbooks is that they are not reused once a new edition comes out.
53. One problem for students to replace traditional textbooks with interactive digital ones is the high cost of the hardware.
54. A few universities have already started to use digital textbooks in certain courses.
55. Inkling CEO explains that the problem with Course Smart's current digital textbooks is that they are no more than print versions put on a screen.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D. You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
Junk food is everywhere. We're eating way too much .of it. Most of us know what we're doing and. yet we do it anyway.So here's a suggestion offered by two researchers at the Rand Corporation: Why not take a lesson from alcohol control policies and apply them to where food is sold and how it's displayed?
"Many policy measures to control obesity (肥胖症) assume .that people consciously and rationally choose what and how much they eat and .therefore focus on providing information and more access to healthier foods," note the two researchers."In contrast," the researchers continue, "many regulations that don't assume people make rational choices have been successfully applied to control alcohol, a substance  like food--of which immoderate consumption leads to serious health problems." 
The research references studies of people's behavior with food and alcohol and results of alcohol restrictions, and then lists five regulations that the researchers think might be promising if applied to junk foods. Among them: Density restrictions: licenses to sell alcohol aren't handed out unplanned to all comers but are allotted (分配) based on the number of places in an area that already .sell alcohol. These make alcohol less easy to get and reduce the number of psychological cues to drink.
Similarly, the researchers say, being presented with junk food stimulates our desire to eat it. SO why not limit the density of food outlets, particularly ones that sell food rich in empty calories? And why not limit sale of food in places that aren't primarily food stores?
Display and sales restrictions: California has a rule prohibiting alcohol displays near the cash registers in gas stations, and in most places you can't buy alcohol at drive-through facilities. At supermarkets, food companies pay to have their wares in places where they're easily seen. One could remove junk food to the back of the store and ban them from the shelves at checkout lines. The other measures include restricting portion sizes, taxing and prohibiting special price deals for junk foods, and placing warning labels on the products.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
Kodak's decision to file for bankruptcy (破产) protection is a sad, though not unexpected, turning point for a leading American corporation that pioneered consumer photography and dominated the film market for decades, but ultimately failed to adapt to the digital revolution.
Although many attribute Kodak's downfall to "complacency(自满)," that explanation doesn't acknowledge the lengths to which the company went to reinvent itself. Decades ago, Kodak anticipated that digital photography would overtake film--and in fact, Kodak invented the first digital camera 1975--but in a fateful decision, the comply chose to shelf its new discovery to focus on its traditional film business.
It wasn't that Kodak was blind to the future, said Rebecca Henderson, a professor at Harvard Business School, but rather that it failed to execute on a strategy to confront it. By the time the company realized its mistake, it was too late. Kodak is an example of a firm that was very much aware that they had to adapt, and spent a lot of money trying to do so, but ultimately failed. Large companies bava difficult time switching to new markets because there is a temptation to put existing assets into the new businesses.
Although Kodak anticipated the inevitable rise of digital photography, its corporate (企业的) culture was too rooted in the successes of the past for it to make the clean break necessary to fully embrace the future. They were a company stuck in time. Their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability.
Kodak's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. In 1976, the company commanded 90% of the market for photographic film and 85% of the market for cameras. But the 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which undermined Kodak by offering lower prices for film and photo supplies. Kodak's decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major miscalculation. The bid went instead to Fuji, which exploited its sponsorship to win a permanent foothold in the marketplace.

B． To show its effort to overcome complacency.
C． To show its quick adaptation to the digital revolution.
D． To show its will to compete with Japan's Fuji Photo.
63. Why do large companies have difficulty switching to new markets?
A． They find it costly to give up their existing assets.
B． They tend to be slow in confronting new challenges.
C． They are unwilling to invest in new technology.
D． They are deeply stuck in their glorious past.
64. What does the author say Kodak's history has become?

C． A joke .
D． A challenge.
65. What was Kodak's fatal mistake?

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2. 
The rise of the sharing economy
A)	LAST night 40,000 people rented accommodation from a service that offers 250,000 rooms in 30,000 cities in 192 countries. They chose their rooms and paid for everything online. But their beds were provided by private individuals, rather than a hotel chain. Hosts and guests were matched up by Airbnb, a firm based in San Francisco. Since its launch in 2008 more than 4m people have used it—2.5million of them in 2012 alone. It is the most prominent example of a huge new “sharing economy”, in which people rent beds, cars, boats and other assets directly from each other, co-ordinated via the internet.  

B)	You might think this is no different from running a bed-and-breakfast（家庭旅店）, owning a timeshare（分时度假房） or participating in a car pool. But technology has reduced transaction costs, making sharing assets cheaper and easier than ever—and therefore possible on a much larger scale. The big change is the availability of more data about people and things, which allows physical assets to be disaggregated and consumed as services. Before the internet, renting a surfboard, a power tool or a parking space from someone else was feasible, but was usually more trouble than it was worth. Now websites such as Airbnb, RelayRides and SnapGoods match up owners and renters; smartphones with GPS let people see where the nearest rentable car is parked; social networks provide a way to check up on people and build trust; and online payment systems handle the billing. 

What’s mine is yours, for a fee  

C)	Just as peer-to-peer businesses like eBay allow anyone to become a retailer, sharing sites let individuals act as an ad hoc（临时的） taxi service, car-hire firm or boutique hotel（精品酒店） as and when it suits them. Just go online or download an app. The model works for items that are expensive to buy and are widely owned by people who do not make full use of them. Bedrooms and cars are the most obvious examples, but you can also rent camping spaces in Sweden, fields in Australia and washing machines in France. As proponents of the sharing economy like to put it, access trumps（胜过） ownership. 

D)	Rachel Botsman, the author of a book on the subject, says the consumer peer-to-peer rental market alone is worth $26 billion. Broader definitions of the sharing economy include peer-to- peer lending (though cash is hardly a spare fixed asset) or putting a solar panel on your roof and selling power back to the grid (电网). And it is not just individuals: the web makes it easier for companies to rent out spare offices and idle machines, too. But the core of the sharing economy is people renting things from each other.  

E)	Such “collaborative（合作的） consumption” is a good thing for several reasons. Owners make money from underused assets. Airbnb says hosts in San Francisco who rent out their homes do so for an average of 58 nights a year, making $9,300. Car owners who rent their vehicles to others using RelayRides make an average of $250 a month; some make more than $1,000. Renters, meanwhile, pay less than they would if they bought the item themselves, or turned to a traditional provider such as a hotel or car-hire firm. (It is not surprising that many sharing firms got going during the financial crisis.) And there are environmental benefits, too: renting a car when you need it, rather than owning one, means fewer cars are required and fewer resources must be devoted to making them.  

F)	For sociable souls, meeting new people by staying in their homes is part of the charm. Curmudgeons（倔脾气的人） who imagine that every renter is Norman Bates can still stay at conventional hotels. For others, the web fosters trust. As well as the background checks carried out by platform owners, online reviews and ratings are usually posted by both parties to each transaction, which makes it easy to spot lousy drivers, bathrobe-pilferers and surfboard-wreckers. By using Facebook and other social networks, participants can check each other out and identify friends (or friends of friends) in common. An Airbnb user had her apartment trashed in 2011. But the remarkable thing is how well the system usually works. Peering into the future

Peering into the future 

G)	The sharing economy is a little like online shopping, which started in America 15 years ago. At first, people were worried about security. But having made a successful purchase from, say, Amazon, they felt safe buying elsewhere. Similarly, using Airbnb or a car-hire service for the first time encourages people to try other offerings. Next, consider eBay. Having started out as a peer-to-peer marketplace, it is now dominated by professional “power sellers” (many of whom started out as ordinary eBay users). The same may happen with the sharing economy, which also provides new opportunities for enterprise. Some people have bought cars solely to rent them out, for example.  

H)	Existing rental businesses are getting involved too. Avis, a car-hire firm, has a share in a sharing rival. So do GM and Daimler, two carmakers. In future, companies may develop hybrid（混合的） models, listing excess capacity (whether vehicles, equipment or office space) on peer-to-peer rental sites. In the past, new ways of doing things online have not displaced the old ways entirely. But they have often changed them. Just as internet shopping forced Walmart and Tesco to adapt, so online sharing will shake up transport, tourism, equipment-hire and more. 

I)	The main worry is regulatory uncertainty (see Technology Quarterly article). Will room-renters be subject to hotel taxes, for example? In Amsterdam officials are using Airbnb listings to track down unlicensed hotels. In some American cities, peer-to-peer taxi services have been banned after lobbying by traditional taxi firms. The danger is that although some rules need to be updated to protect consumers from harm, incumbents will try to destroy competition. People who rent out rooms should pay tax, of course, but they should not be regulated like a Ritz-Carlton hotel. The lighter rules that typically govern bed-and-breakfasts are more than adequate.  

J)	The sharing economy is the latest example of the internet„s value to consumers. This emerging model is now big and disruptive（颠覆性的） enough for regulators and companies to have woken up to it. That is a sign of its immense potential. It is time to start caring about sharing.

46. Sharing items such as cars does good to the environment. 
47. Airbnb’s success clearly illustrates the emergence of a huge sharing economy. 
48. The major concern about the sharing economy is how the government regulates it. 
49. The most frequently shared items are those expensive to buy but not fully used.

52. Airbnb is a website that enables owners and renters to complete transactions online. 
53. The sharing economy is likely to go the way of online shopping. 
54. One advantage of sharing is that owners earn money from renting out items not made full use of. 
55. Sharing appeals to the sociable in that they can meet new people. 

Section C 
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One 
Questions 56 t0 60 are based on the following passage. 

　　In recent years, a growing body of research has shown that our appetite and food intake are influenced by a large number of factors besides our biological need for energy, including our eating environment and our perception of the food in front of us.
　　Studies have shown, for instance, that eating in front of the TV (or a similar distraction) can increase both hunger and the amount of food consumed. Even simple visual cues, like plate size and lighting, have been shown to affect portion size and consumption.
　　A new study suggested that our short-term memory also may play a role in appetite. Several hours after a meal, people’s hunger levels were predicted not by how much they’d eaten but rather by how much food they’d seen in front of them—in other words, how much they remembered eating.
　　This disparity (差异) suggests the memory of our previous meal may have a bigger influence on our appetite than the actual size of the meal, says Jeffrey M. Brunstrom, a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Bristol.
　　“Hunger isn’t controlled solely by the physical characteristics of a recent meal. We have identified an independent role for memory for that meal,” Brunstrom says. “This shows that the relationship between hunger and food intake is more complex than we thought.”
　　These findings echo earlier research that suggests our perception of food can sometimes trick our body’s response to the food itself. In a 2011 study, for instance, people who drank the same 380-calorie (卡路里) milkshake on two separate occasions produced different levels of hunger-related hormones (荷尔蒙), depending on whether the shake’s label said it contained 620 or 140 calories. Moreover, the participants reported feeling more full when they thought they’d consumed a higher-calorie shake.
　　What does this mean for our eating habits? Although it hardly seems practical to trick ourselves into eating less, the new findings do highlight the benefits of focusing on our food and avoiding TV and multitasking while eating.
　　The so-called mindful-eating strategies can fight distractions and help us control our appetite, Brunstrom says.

56. What is said to be a factor affecting our appetite and food intake? 
　　A) How we perceive the food we eat.		B) What ingredients the food contains.
　　C) When we eat our meals. 				D) How fast we eat our meals.  
57. What would happen at meal time if you remembered eating a lot in the previous meal? 
　　A) You would probably be more picky about food. 
　　B) You would not feel like eating the same food. 
　　C) You would have a good appetite. 
　　D) You would not feel so hungry.  
58. What do we learn from the 2011 study?  
　　A) Food labels may mislead consumers in their purchases.  
　　B) Food labels may influence our body’s response to food. 
　　C) Hunger levels depend on one’s consumption of calories. 
　　D) People tend to take in a lot more calories than necessary.  
59. What does Brunstrom suggest we do to control our appetite?  
　　A) Trick ourselves into eating less. 		B) Choose food with fewer calories.
　　C) Concentrate on food while eating. 		D) Pick dishes of the right size. 
60. What is the main idea of the passage?  
　　A) Eating distractions often affect our food digestion. 
　　B) Psychological factors influence our hunger levels.  
　　C) Our food intake is determined by our biological needs. 
　　D) Good eating habits will contribute to our health.

Passage Two  
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.  
　　As a society we might want to rethink the time and money spent on education, so that these resources can benefit a greater percentage of the population. Ideally, both high schools and colleges can prepare individuals for the ever-changing roles that are likely to be expected of them.
　　High school degrees offer far less in the way of preparation for work than they might, or than many other nations currently offer, creating a growing skills gap in our economy. We encourage students to go on to college whether they are prepared or not, or have a clear sense of purpose or interest, and now have the highest college dropout rate in the world.
　　We might look to other countries for models of how high schools can offer better training, as well as the development of a work ethic (勤奋工作的美德) and the intellectual skills needed for continued learning and development. I recommend Harvard’s 2011 “Pathways to Prosperity” report for more attention to the “forgotten half” (those who do not go on to college) and ideas about how to address this issue.
　　Simultaneously, the liberal arts become more important than ever. In a knowledge economy where professional roles change rapidly and many college students are preparing for positions that may not even exist yet, the skill set needed is one that prepares them for change and continued learning.
　　Learning to express ideas well in both writing and speech, knowing how to find information, and knowing how to do research are all solid background skills for a wide variety of roles, and such training is more important than any particular major in a liberal arts college. We need to continue to value broad preparation in thinking skills that will serve for a lifetime.
　　Students also need to learn to work independently and to make responsible decisions. The lengthening path to adulthood appears exacerbated (恶化) by parental involvement in the college years. Given the rising investment in college education, parental concern is not surprising, but learning where and when to intervene (干预) will help students take more ownership of the outcomes of these increasingly costly educations.

61. What kind of education does the author think is ideal? 
　　A) It benefits the great majority of the general population. 
　　B) It prepares students to meet the future needs of society. 
　　C) It encourages students to learn throughout their lives.  
　　D) It ensures that students’ expectations are successfully fulfilled.  
62. What does the author say is the problem with present high school education? 
　　A) Ignoring the needs of those who don’t go to college. 
　　B) Teaching skills to be used right after graduation only. 
　　C) Giving little attention to those having difficulty learning. 
　　D) Creating the highest dropout rate in the developed world.  
63. What characterizes a knowledge economy according to the passage?  
　　A) People have to receive higher education to qualify for a professional position. 
　　B) Students majoring in liberal arts usually have difficulty securing a job.  
　　C) New positions are constantly created that require people to keep learning.  
　　D) Colleges find it hard to teach students how to cope with the changing economy. 
64. What does the author think a liberal arts college should focus on? 
　　A) Solid background knowledge in a particular field. 
　　B) Practical skills urgently needed in current society. 
　　C) Basic skills needed for change and lifelong learning. 
　　D) Useful thinking skills for advanced academic research. 
65. What suggestion does the author offer to parents? 
　　A) Rethinking the value of higher education.  
　　B) Investing wisely in their children’s education.  
　　C) Helping their children to bring their talent into full play.  
　　D) Avoiding too much intervention in their children’s education.

Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage .
　　What does it take to be a well-trained nurse ? The answer used to be two-year associate’s of four-year bachelor’s degree programs．But as the nursing shortage _36_，a growing number of schools and hospitals are establishing“ fast-track programs”that enable college graduates with no nursing _37_ to become registered nurses with only a year or so of _38_ training .
　　In 1991，there were only 40 fast-track curricula ; now there are more than 200. Typical is Columbia University’s Entry to Practice program. Students earn their bachelor of science in nursing in a year .  Those who stay on for an  _39_  two years can earn a master’s degree that  _40_  them as nurse practitioners (执业护士) or clinical nurse specialists．
　　Many students are recent _41_ ; others are career switchers．Rudy Guardron，32，a 2004 graduate of Columbia’s program, was a premedical student in college and then worked for a pharmaceutical (药物的) research company . At Columbia , he was _42_  as a nurses practitioner . “I saw that nurses were in high _43_ and it looked like a really good opportunity，”he says．“Also，I didn't want to be in school for that long.’’
　　The fast-track trend fills a need，but it’s also creating some _44_ between newcomers and veterans.“Nurses that are still at the bedside _45_ these kids with suspicion，”says Linda Pellico，who has taught nursing at Yale University for l8 years.“They wonder, how can they do it quicker?”The answer is they don’t.

　　The rise of the sharing economy
A)   Last night 40,000 people rented accommodation from a service that offers 250,000 rooms in 30,000  cities in 192 countries. They chose their rooms and paid for everything online.  But their bed  were provided by private individuals，rather than a hotel chain. Hosts and guests were matched up by Airbnb , a firm based in San Francisco. Since its launch in 2008 more than 4 million people have used it—2.5 million of them in 2012 alone. It is the most prominent example of a huge new “sharing economy”, in which people rent beds，cars , boats and other assets directly from each other , co-ordinated via the internet.
B)   You might think this is no different from running a bed-and-breakfast (家庭旅店)，owning a timeshare (分时度假房) or participating in a car pool. But technology has reduced transaction costs, making sharing assets cheaper and easier than ever——and therefore possible on a much larger scale. The big change is the availability of more data about people and things，which allows physical assets to be divided and consumed as services. Before the internet, renting a surfboard , a power tool or a parking space from someone else was feasible，but was usually more trouble than it was worth Now websites such as Airbnb，RelayRides and SnapGoods match up owners and renters ; smartphones with GPS let people see where the nearest rentable car is parked ; social networks provide a way to check up on people mad build trust；and online payment systems handle the billing.
　　What’s mine is yours，for a fee
C)   Just as peer-to-peer businesses like eBay allow anyone to become a retailer , sharing sites let  individuals act as all ad hoc (临时的) taxi service，car-hire firm or boutique hotel (精品酒店) as and when it suits them. Just go online or download an app. The model works for items that are expensive to buy and are widely owned by people who do not make full use of them. Bedrooms and cars are the most obvious examples, but you can also rent camping spaces in Sweden, fields in Australia and washing machines in France. As advocates of the sharing economy like to put it , access trumps (胜过) ownership.
D)       Rachel Botsmam , the author of a book on the subject, says the consumer peer-to-peer rental market alone is worth $26 billion. Broader definitions of the sharing economy include peer-to-peer lending or putting a solar panel on your roof and selling power back to the grid (电网).  And it is not just individuals: the web makes it easier for companies  to rent out spare  offices and idle machines, too. But the core of the sharing economy is people renting things from each other.
E)       Such “collaborative” (合作的) consumption is a good thing for several reasons. Owners make money from underused assets. Airbnb says hosts in San Francisco who rent out their homes do so for an average of 58 nights a year,  making  $9,300.  Car owners who rent out their vehicles to others using RelayRides make an average of $250 a month ;  some make more than $1,000. Renters, meanwhile, pay 1ess than they would if they bought the item themselves, or turned to a traditional provider such as a hote1 or car-hire firm. And there are environmental benefits , too: renting a car when you need it, rather than owning one, means fewer cars are required and fewer resources must be devoted to making them.
F)     For sociable souls, meeting new people by staying in their homes is part of the charm. Curmudgeons (倔脾气的人) who imagine that every renter is a murderer can still stay at conventional hotels. For others, the web fosters trust. As well as the background checks carried out by platform owners, online reviews and ratings are usually posted by both parties to each transaction, which makes it easy to spot bad drivers, bathrobe-thieves and surfboard-wreckers. By using Facebook and other social networks, participants can check each other out and identify friends (or friends of friends)  in common.  An Airbnb user had her apartment trashed in 2011. But the remarkable thing is how well the system usually woks.
Peering into the future
G)      The sharing economy is a little like online shopping, which started in America 15 year ago.  At first, people were worried about security.  But having made a successful purchase from, say, Amazon, they felt safe buying elsewhere. Similarly,  using Airbnb or a car-hire service for the first time encourages people to try other offerings. Next, consider eBay.  Having started out as a peer-to-peer marketplace, it is now dominated by professional “power seller” (many of whom started out as ordinary eBay users). The same may happen with the sharing economy, which also provides new opportunities for enterprise. Some people have bought cars solely to rent them out,  for example.
H)      Existing rental businesses are getting involved too. Avis, a car-hire firm, has a  share in a sharing rival. So do GM ad Daimler, two carmakers.  In future, companies may develop hybrid (混合的) models, listing excess capacity (whether vehicles, equipment or office space) on peer-to-peer renta1 sites. In the past, new ways of doing things online have not displaced the old ways entirely. But they have often changed them. Just as internet shopping forced Wal-mart and Tesco to adapt, so online sharing will shake up transport, tourism, equipment-hire and more.
I)        The main worry is regulatory uncertainty. Will room-renters be subject to hotel taxes, for example? In Amsterdam officials are using Airbnb listings to track down unlicensed hotels. In some American cities, peer-to-peer taxi services have been banned after lobbying by traditional taxi firms. The danger is that although some rules need to be updated to protect consumers from harm, existing rental businesses will try to destroy competition. People who rent out rooms should pay tax, of course, but they should not be regulated like a Ritz-Carlton hotel. The lighter rules that typically govern bed-and-breakfasts are more than adequate.
J)        The sharing  economy is the latest example of the internet's value to consumers. This emerging model is now big and disruptive (颠覆性的) enough for regulators and companies to have woken up to it. That is a sign of its immense potential.  It is time to start caring about sharing.
46. Sharing items such as cars does good to the environment.
47. Airbnb's success clearly illustrates the emergence of a huge sharing economy.
48. The major concern about the sharing economy is how the government regulates it.
49. The most frequently shared items are those expensive to buy but not fully used.
50.  The sharing economy has a promising future.
51. Online sharing will change the way business is done in transportation, travel, rentals, etc.
52. Airbnb is a website that enables owners and renters to complete transactions online.
53.   The sharing economy is likely to go the way of online shopping.
54.  One advantage of sharing is that owners earn money from renting out items not made full use of.
55.   Sharing appeals to the sociable in that they can meet new people.
Section C
Directions : There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A) , B) , C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　In recent years, a growing body of research has shown that our appetite and food intake are influenced by a large number of factors besides our biological need for energy, including our eating environment and our perception of the food in front of us.
　　Studies have shown, for instance, that eating in front of the TV (or a similar distraction ) can increase both hunger and the amount of food consumed. Even simple visual cues, like plate size and lighting, have been shown to affect portion size and consumption.
　　A new study suggested that our short-term memory also may play a role in appetite.  Several hours after a meal, people's hunger levels were predicted not by how much they'd eaten but rather by now much food they'd seen in front of them---in other words, how much they remembered eating.
　　This disparity(差异) suggests the memory of our previous meal may have a bigger influence on our appetite than the actual size of the meal,  says Jeffrey M.  Brunstrom,  a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Bristol.
　　“Hunger isn't controlled solely by the physical characteristics of a recent meal. We have identified an independent role for memory for that meal,” Brunstrom says. “This shows that the relationship between hunger and food intake is more complex than we thought. “
　　These findings echo earlier research that suggests our perception of food can sometimes trick our body's response to the food itself. In a 2011 study, for instance, people who drank the same 880-caiorie (卡路里) milkshake on two separate occasions produced different levels of hunger-related hormones ( 荷尔蒙 ), depending on whether the shake's label said it contained 620 or 140 calories. Moreover, the participants reported feeling more full when they thought they'd consumed a higher-calorie shake.
　　What does this mean for our eating habits ? Although it hardly seems practical to trick  ourselves into eating less, the new findings do highlight the benefits of focusing on our food and avoiding TV and multitasking while eating.
　　The  so-called mindful-eating strategies can fight distractions and help us control our appetite , Brunstrom says.                                                                        
　　56．What is said to be a factor affecting our appetite and food intake ?
　　    A) How we perceive the food we eat.    C) When we eat our meals.
　　    B) What ingredients the food contains.  D) How fast we eat our meals.
　　57．What would happen at meal time if you remembered eating a lot in the previous meal?
　　    A) You would probably be more picky about food．
　　    B) You would not feel like eating the same food．
　　    C) You would have a good appetite．
　　    D) You would not feel so hungry．
　　58．What do we learn from the 2011 study?
　　    A) Food labels may mislead consumers in their purchases．
　　    B) Food labels may influence our body’s response to food．
　　    C) Hunger levels depend on one’s consumption of calories．
　　    D) People tend to take in a lot more calories than necessary．
　　59. What does Brunstrom suggest we do to control our appetite?
　　    A) Trick ourselves into eating less.    C) Concentrate on food while eating．
　　    B) Choose food with fewer calories.    D) Pick dishes of the right size．
　　60 .What is the main idea of the passage7
　　　A) Eating distractions often affect our food digestion．
　　　B) Psychological factors influence our hunger levels．
　　　C) Our food intake is determined by our biological needs.
　　　D) Good eating habits will contribute to our health．
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　　As a society we might want to rethink the time and money spent on education , so that these resources can benefit a greater percentage of the population.  Ideally，both high schools and colleges can prepare individuals for the ever-changing roles that are likely to be expected of them.
　　   High school degrees offer far less in the way of preparation for work than they might, or than many other nations currently offer，creating a growing skills gap in our economy．We encourage students to go on to  college whether they are prepared or not，or have a clear sense of purpose or interest , and now have the highest college dropout rate in the world． 
　　  We might look to other countries for models of how high schools can offer better training，as well as the development of a work ethic ( 勤奋工作的美德 ) and the intellectual skills needed for continued learning and development. I recommend Harvard's 2011 “Pathways to Prosperity ” report for more attention to the“forgotten half” ( those who do not go on to college) and ideas about how to address this issue．
　　Simultaneously，the liberal arts become more important than ever. In a knowledge economy where professional roles change rapidly and many college students are preparing for positions that may not even exist yet，the skill set needed is one that prepares them for change and continued learning.
　　Learning to express ideas well in both writing and speech，knowing how to find information , and knowing how to do research are all solid background skills for a wide variety of roles，and such training is more important than any particular major in a liberal arts college. We need to continue to value broad  preparation in thinking skills that will serve for a lifetime.
　　  Students also need to learn to work independently and to make responsible decisions. The lengthening path to adulthood appears exacerbated (恶化) by parental involvement in the college years. Given the rising investment in college education，parental concern is not surprising，but learning where and when to intervene ( 干预 ) will help students take more ownership of the outcomes of these increasingly costly educations .
61.  What kind of education does the author think  is ideal?
　　A)  It benefits the great majority of the general population.
　　B)  It prepares students to meet the future needs of society.     
　　C)  It encourages students to learn throughout their lives.                        
　　D)  It ensures that students' expectations are successfully fulfilled.
62. What does the author say is the problem with present high school education?
A) Ignoring the needs of those who don't go to college.                              
B) Teaching skills to be used right after graduation only.
　　C) Giving little attention to those having difficulty learning.
　　D) Creating the highest dropout rate in the developed world.    
63. What characterizes a knowledge economy according to the passage?
　　A)  People have to receive higher education to qualify for a professional position.
　　B)   Students majoring in liberal arts usually have difficulty securing a job.     
　　C) New positions are constantly created that require people to keep learning. 
　　D) Colleges find it hard to teach students how to cope with the changing economy.
64. What does the author think a liberal arts college should focus on?
　　A) Solid background knowledge in a particular field.              
　　B) Practical skills urgently needed in current society.                  
　　C) Basic skills needed for change and lifelong learning.
　　D) Useful thinking skills for advanced academic research.
65.What suggestion does the author offer to parents?
　　A) Rethinking the value of higher education.
　　B) Investing wisely in their children's education.
　　C) Helping their children to bring their talent into full play.
　　D) Avoiding too much intervention in their children's education.

Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　To get a sense of how women have progressed in science, take a quick tour of the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley. This is a storied place, the   36   of some of the most important discoveries in modern science — starting with Ernest Lawrence’s invention of the cyclotron (回旋加速器) in 1931. A generation ago, female faces were   37   and, even today, visitors walking through the first floor of LeConte Hall will see a full corridor of exhibits   38   the many distinguished physicists who made history here,   39   all of them white males.
　　But clime up to the third floor and you’ll see a   40   display. There, among the photos of current faculty members and students, are portraits of the   41   head of the department, Marjorie Shapiro, and four other women whose research   42   everything from the mechanics of the universe to the smallest particles of matter. A sixth woman was hired just two weeks ago. Although they’re still only about 10 percent of the physics faculty, women are clearly a presence here.

Is College a Worthy Investment?
A) Why are we spending so much money on college? And why are we so unhappy about it? We all seem to agree that a college education is wonderful, and yet strangely we worry when we see families investing so much in this supposedly essential good. Maybe it’s time to ask a question that seems almost sacrilegious (大不敬的): is all this investment in college education really worth it?
B) The answer, I fear, is no. For an increasing number of kids, the extra time and money spent pursuing a college diploma will leave them worse off than they were before they set foot on campus.
C) For my entire adult life, a good education has been the most important thing for middle-class households. My parents spent more educating my sister and me than they spent on their house, and they’re not the only ones… and, of course, for an increasing number of families, most of the cost of their house is actually the cost of living in a good school district. Questioning the value of a college education seems a bit like questioning the value of happiness, or fun.
D) The average price of all goods and services has risen about 50 percent. But the price of a college education has nearly doubled in that time. Is the education that today’s students are getting twice as good? Are new workers twice as smart? Have they become somehow massively more expensive to educate?
E) Perhaps a bit. Richard Vedder, an Ohio University economics professor, says, “I look at the data, and I see college costs rising faster than inflation up to the mid-1980s by 1 percent a year. Now I see them rising 3 to 4 percent a year over inflation. What has happened? The federal government has started dropping money out of airplanes.” Aid has increased, subsidized (补贴的) loans have become available, and “the universities have gotten the money.” Economist Bryan Caplan, who is writing a book about education, agrees: “It’s a giant waste of resources that will continue as long as the subsidies continue.”
F) Promotional literature for colleges and student loans often speaks of debt as an “investment in yourself.” But an investment is supposed to generate income to pay off the loans. More than half of all recent graduates are unemployed or in jobs that do not require a degree, and the amount of student-loan debt carried by households has increased more than five times since 1999. These graduates were told that a diploma was all they needed to succeed, but it won’t even get them out of the spare bedroom at Mom and Dad’s. For many, the most visible result of their four years is the loan payments, which now average hundreds of dollars a month on loan balances in the tens of thousands.
G) It’s true about the money — sort of. College graduates now make 80 percent more than people who have only a high-school diploma, and though there are no precise estimates, the wage premium (高出的部分) for an outstanding school seems to be even higher. But that’s not true of every student. It’s very easy to spend four years majoring in English literature and come out no more employable than your were before you went in. Conversely, chemical engineers straight out of school can easily make almost four times the wages of an entry-level high-school graduate.
H) James Heckman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, has examined how the returns on education break down for individuals with different backgrounds and levels of ability. “Even with these high prices, you’re still finding a high return for individuals who are bright and motivated,” he says. On the other hand, “if you’re not college ready, then the answer is no, it’s not with it.” Experts tend to agree that for the average student, college is still worth it today, but they also agree that the rapid increase in price is eating up more and more of the potential return. For borderline students, tuition (学费) rise can push those returns into negative territory.
I)  Everyone seems to agree that the government, and parents, should be rethinking how we invest in higher education— and that employers need to rethink the increasing use of college degrees as crude screening tools for jobs that don’t really require college skills. “Employers seeing a surplus of college gradates and looking to fill jobs are just adding that requirement,” says Vedder. “In fact, a college degree becomes a job requirement for becoming a bar-tender.”
J) We have started to see some change on the finance side. A law passed in 2007 allows many students to cap their loan payment at 10 percent of their income and forgives any balance after 25 years. But of course, that doesn’t control the cost of education; it just shifts it to taxpayers. It also encourages graduates to choose lower-paying careers, which reduces the financial return to education still further. “You’re subsidizing people to become priests and poets and so forth,” says Heckman. “You may think that’s a good thing, or you may not.” Either way it will be expensive for the government.
K) What might be a lot cheaper is putting more kids to work. Caplan notes that work also builds valuable skills — probably more valuable for kids who don’t naturally love sitting in a classroom. Heckman agrees wholeheartedly: “People are different, and those abilities can be shaped. That’s what we’ve learned, and public policy should recognize that.”
L) Heckman would like to see more apprenticeship-style (学徒式) programs, where kids can learn in the workplace — learn not just specific job skills, but the kind of “soft skills,” like getting to work on time and getting along with a team, that are crucial for career success. “It’s about having mentors (指导者) and having workplace-based education,” he says. “Time and again I’ve seen examples of this kind of program working.”
M) Ah, but how do we get there from here? With better public policy, hopefully, but also by making better individual decisions. “ Historically markets have been to handle these things,” says Vedder, “and I think eventually markets will handle this one. If it doesn’t improve soon, people are going to wake up and ask, ‘why am I going to college?’”

46. Caplan suggests that kids who don’t love school go to work.
47. An increasing number of families spend more money on houses in a good school district.
48. Subsidized loans to college students are a huge waste of money, according to one economist.
49. More and more kids find they fare worse with a college diploma.
50. For those who are not prepared for higher education, going to college is not worth it.
51. Over the years the cost of a college education has increased almost by 100%.
52. A law passed recently allows many students to pay no more than one tenth of their income for their college loans.
53. Middle-class Americans have highly valued a good education.
54. More kids should be encouraged to participate in programs where they can learn not only job skills but also social skills.
55. Over fifty percent of recent college graduates remain unemployed or unable to find a suitable job.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　A recent global survey of 2,000 high-net-worth individuals found about 60% were not planning on a traditional retirement. Among U.S. participants, 75% expected to continue working in some capacity even after stepping away from full-time jobs. “Many of these people made their wealth by doing something they’re passionate (有激情的) about,” says Daniel Egan, head of behavioral finance for Barclays Wealth Americas. “Given the choice, they prefer to continue working.” Barclays calls these people “nevertirees”.
　　Unlike many Americans compelled into early retirement by company restrictions, the average nevertiree often has no one forcing his hand. If 106-year-old investor Irving Kahn, head of his own family firm, wants to keep coming to work every day, who’s going to stop him? Seventy-eight-year-old Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s job security is guaranteed in the Constitution.
　　It may seem that these elderly people are trying to cheat death. In fact, they are. And it’s working. Howard Friedman, a professor at UC Riverside, found in his research that those who work hardest and are successful in their careers often live the longest lives. “People are generally being given bad advice to slow down, take it easy, stop worrying, and retire to Florida,” he says. He described one study participant, still working at the age of 100, who was recently disappointed to see his son retire.
　　“We’re beginning to see a change in how people view retirement,” says George Leeson, co-director of the Institute of Population Ageing at Oxford. Where once retirement was seen as a brief reward after a long struggle through some miserable job, it is now akin (近似) to being cast aside. What Leeson terms “the Warren Buffett effect” is becoming more broadly appealing as individuals come to “view retirement as not simply being linked to economic productivity but also about contribution.”
　　Observers are split on whether this is a wholly good thing. On the one hand, companies and financial firms can benefit from the wisdom of a resilient (坚韧的) chief. On the other, the new generation can find it more difficult to advance — an argument that typically holds little sway to a nevertiree.

56. What do we learn about the so-called “nevertirees”?
　　A) They are passionate about making a fortune.
　　B) They have no choice but to continue working.
　　C) They love what they do and choose not to retire.
　　D) They will not retire unless they are compelled to.
57. What do Irving Kahn and Ruth Bader Ginsburg have in common?
　　A) Neither of them is subject to forced retirement.
　　B) Neither of them desires reward for their work.
　　C) Both cling to their positions despite opposition.
　　D) Both are capable of coping with heavy workloads.
58. What is the finding of Howard Friedman’s research?
　　A) The harder you work, the bigger your fortune will be.
　　B) The earlier you retire, the healthier you will be.
　　C) Elderly people have to slow down to live longer.
　　D) Working at an advanced age lengthens people’s life.
59. What is the traditional view of retirement according to the passage?
　　A) It means a burden to the younger generation.
　　B) It is a symbol of a mature and civilized society.
　　C) It is a compensation for one’s life-long hard work.
　　D) It helps increase a nation’s economic productivity.
60. What do critics say about “nevertirees”?
　　A) They are an obstacle to a company’s development.
　　B) They lack the creativity of the younger generation.
　　C) They cannot work as efficiently as they used to.
　　D) They prevent young people from getting ahead.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　When we talk about Americans barely into adulthood who are saddled with unbearable levels of debt, the conversation is almost always about student loan debt. But there’s a growing body of evidence suggesting that today’s young adults are also drowning in credit-card debt — and that many of them will take this debt to their graves.
　　More than 20% overspent their income by more than $100 every single month. Since they haven’t built up their credit histories yet, it’s a safe bet that these young adults are paying relatively high interest rates on the resulting credit card debt.
　　Although many young people blame “socializing” as a barrier to saving money, most of them aren’t knocking back $20 drinks in trendy (时尚的) lounges. They’re struggling with much more daily financial demands.
　　To a disturbingly large extent, the young and the broke are relying on credit cards to make it until their next payday. This obviously isn’t sustainable in the long run, and it’s going to put a huge drag on their spending power even after they reach their peak earning years, because they’ll still be paying interest on that bottle of orange juice or box of spaghetti (意式面条) they bought a decade earlier.
　　A new study out of Ohio State University found that young adults are accumulating credit card debt at a more rapid rate than other age groups, and that they’re slower at paying it off. “If what we found continues to hold true, we may have more elderly people with substantial financial problems in the future,” warns Lucia Dunn, professor of economics at Ohio State. “If our findings persist, we may be faced with a financial crisis among elderly people who can’t pay off their credit cards.”
    Dunn says a lot of these young people are never going to get out from under their credit card debt. “Many people are borrowing on credit cards so heavily that payoff rates at these levels are not sufficient to recover their credit card debt by the end of their life, which could have loss implications for the credit card issuing banks.”

61. What is the main idea of the first paragraph?
　　A) Many young Americans will never be able to pay off their debts.
　　B) Credit cards play an increasingly important role in college life.
　　C) Credit cards are doing more harm than students loans.
　　D) The American credit card system is under criticism.
62. Why do young people have to pay a higher interest on their credit card debt?
　　A) They tend to forget about the deadlines.
　　B) They haven’t developed a credit history.
　　C) They are often unable to pay back in time.
　　D) They are inexperienced in managing money.
63. What is said to be the consequence of young adults relying on credit cards to make ends meet?
　　A) It will place an unnecessary burden on society.
　　B) It will give them no motivation to work hard.
　　C) It will exert psychological pressure on them.
　　D) It will affect their future spending power.
64. What will happen to young adults if their credit card debt keeps accumulating according to Lucia Dunn?
　　A) They will have to pay an increasingly higher interest rate.
　　B) They may experience a financial crisis in their old age.
　　C) Their quality of life will be affected.
　　D) Their credit cards may be cancelled.
65. What does Lucia Dunn think might be a risk for the credit card issuing banks?
　　A) They go bankrupt as a result of over-lending.
　　B) They lose large numbers of their regular clients.
　　C) Their clients leave their debts unpaid upon death.
　　D) Their interest rates have to be reduced now and then.

　　　According to American law, if someone is accused of a crime, he is considered    26    until the court proves the person is guilty.
　　　To arrest a person, the police have to be reasonably sure that a crime has been    27  . The police must give the suspect the reasons why they are arresting him and tell him his rights under the law. Then the police take the suspect to the police station, where the name of the person and the    28    against him are formally listed.
　　　The next step is for the suspect to go before a judge. The judge decides whether the suspect should be kept in jail or   29 . If the suspect has no previous criminal record and the judge feels that he will return to court   30   run away, he can go free. Otherwise, the suspect must put up bail (保释金). At this time, too, the judge will   31    a court lawyer to defend the suspect if he can’t afford one.
　　　The suspect returns to court a week or two later. A lawyer from the district attorney’s office presents a case against the suspect. The attorney may present    32    as well as witnesses. The judge then decides whether there is enough reason to   33 .

Part Ⅲ	                               Reading Comprehension	                      (40 minutes)
Section A
Directions ： In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　Global warming is a trend toward warmer conditions around the world. Part of the warming is natural; we have experienced a 20,000-year-long warming as the last ice age ended and the ice   36   away. However, we have already reached temperatures that are in   37   with other minimum-ice periods, so continued warming is likely not natural. We are   38   to a predicted worldwide increase in temperatures   39   between 1 ℃ and 6 ℃ over the next 100 years. The warming will be more   40 in some areas, less in others, and some places may even cool off. Likewise, the   41   of this warming will be very different depending on where you are—coastal areas must worry about rising sea levels, while Siberia and northern Canada may become more habitable (宜居的) and   42   for humans than these areas are now.
　　　The fact remains, however, that it will likely get warmer, on   43   , everywhere. Scientists are in general agreement that the warmer conditions we have been experiencing are at least in part the result of a human-induced global warming trend. Some scientists    44   that the changes we are seeing fall within the range of random (无规律的）variation—some years are cold, others warm, and we have just had an unremarkable string of warm years   45   —but that is becoming an increasingly rare interpretation in the face of continued and increasing warm conditions.


Section B
Directions ： In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
The End of the Book?
A)Amazon, by far the largest bookseller in the country, reported on May 19 that it is now selling more books in its electronic Kindle format than in the old paper-and-ink format. That is remarkable, considering that the Kindle has only been around for four years. E-books now account for 14 percent of all book sales in this country and are increasing far faster than overall book sales. E-book sales are up 146 percent over last year, while hardback sales increased 6 percent and paperbacks decreased 8 percent.
B)Does this spell the doom of the physical book? Certainly not immediately, and perhaps not at all. What it does mean is that the book business will go through a transformation in the next decade or so more profound than any it has seen since Gutenberg introduced printing from moveable type in the 1450s.
C)Physical books will surely become much rarer in the marketplace. Mass market paperbacks, which have been declining for years anyway, will probably disappear, as will hardbacks for mysteries, thrillers, “romance fiction,” etc. Such books,  which only rarely end up in permanent collections, either private or public, will probably only be available as e-books within a few years. Hardback and trade paperbacks for “serious” nonfiction and fiction will surely last longer. Perhaps it will become the mark of an author to reckon with that he or she is still published in hard copy.
D)As for children’s books, who knows? Children’s books are like dog food in that the purchasers are not the consumers, so the market (and the marketing) is inherently strange.
E)For clues to the book’s future, let’s look at some examples of technological change and see what happened to the old technology.
F)One technology replaces another only because the new technology is better, cheaper, or both. The greater the difference, the sooner and more thoroughly the new technology replaces the old. Printing with moveable type on paper dramatically reduced the cost of producing a book compared with the old-fashioned ones handwritten on vellum, which comes from sheepskin. A Bible—to be sure, a long book—required vellum made from 300 sheepskins and countless man-hours of labor. Before printing arrived, a Bible cost more than a middle-class house. There were perhaps 50,000 books in all of Europe in 1450. By 1500 there were 10 million.
G)But while printing quickly caused the handwritten book to die out, handwriting lingered on (继续存在)well into the 16th century. Very special books are still occasionally produced on vellum, but they are one-of-a-kind show pieces.
H)Sometimes a new technology doesn’t drive the old one out, but only parts of it while forcing the rest to evolve. The movies were widely predicted to drive live theater out of the marketplace, but they didn’t, because theater turned out to have qualities movies could not reproduce. Equally, TV was supposed to replace movies but, again, did not.
I)Movies did, however, fatally impact some parts of live theater. And while TV didn’t kill movies, it did kill second-rate pictures, shorts, and cartoons.
J)Nor did TV kill radio. Comedy and drama shows (“Jack Benny, “Amos and Andy, “The Shadow”) all migrated to television. But because you can’t drive a car and watch television at the same time, rush hour became radio’s prime time, while music, talk, and news radio greatly enlarged their audiences. Radio is today a very different business than in the late 1940s and a much larger one.
K)Sometimes old technology lingers for centuries because of its symbolic power. Mounted cavalry (骑兵)replaced the	chariot(二轮战车）on the battlefield around 1000 BC. But chariots maintained their place in parades and triumphs right up until the end of the Roman Empire 1,500 years later. The sword hasn’t had a military function for a hundred years, but is still part of an officer’s full- dress uniform, precisely because a sword always symbolized “ an officer and a gentleman.’’
L)Sometimes new technology is a little cranky(不稳定的）at first. Television repairman was a common occupation in the 1950s, for instance. And so the old technology remains as a backup. Steamships captured the North Atlantic passenger business from sail in the 1840s because of its much greater speed. But steamships didn’t lose their sails until the 1880s, because early marine engines had a nasty habit of breaking down. Until ships became large enough (and engines small enough) to mount two engines side by side, they needed to keep sails. (The high cost of steam and the lesser need for speed kept the majority of the world’s ocean freight moving by sail until the early years of the 20th century.)
M)Then there is the fireplace. Central heating was present in every upper- and middle-class home by the second half of the 19th century. But functioning fireplaces remain to this day a powerful selling point in a house or apartment. I suspect the reason is a deep-rooted love of fire. Fire was one of the earliest major technological advances for humankind, providing heat, protection, and cooked food (which is much easier to eat and digest). Human control of fire goes back far enough (over a million years) that evolution could have produced a genetic leaning towards fire as a central aspect of human life.
N) Books—especially books the average person could afford—haven’t been around long enough to produce evolutionary change in humans. But they have a powerful hold on many people nonetheless, a hold extending far beyond their literary content. At their best, they are works of art and there is a tactile (触觉的）pleasure in books necessarily lost in e-book versions. The ability to quickly thumb through pages is also lost. And a room with books in it induces, at least in some, a feeling not dissimilar to that of a fire in the fireplace on a cold winter’s night.
O)For these reasons I think physical books will have a longer existence as a commercial product than some currently predict. Like swords, books have symbolic power. Like fireplaces, they induce a sense of comfort and warmth. And, perhaps, similar to sails, they make a useful backup for when the lights go out.
46.Authors still published in printed versions will be considered important ones.
47.Some people are still in favor of printed books because of the sense of touch they can provide.
48.The radio business has changed greatly and now attracts more listeners.
49.Contrary to many peopled prediction of its death, the film industry survived.
50.Remarkable changes have taken place in the book business.
51.Old technology sometimes continues to exist because of its reliability.
52.The increase of e-book sales will force the book business to make changes not seen for centuries.
53.A new technology is unlikely to take the place of an old one without a clear advantage.
54.Paperbacks of popular literature are more likely to be replaced by e-books.
55.A house with a fireplace has a stronger appeal to buyers.
Section C
Directions ： There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　The question of whether our government should promote science and technology or the liberal arts in higher education isn’t an either/or proposition (命题), although the current emphasis on preparing young Americans for STEM (science, technology, engineering, maths)-related fields can make it seem that way.
　　The latest congressional report acknowledges the critical importance of technical training, but also asserts that the study of the humanities (人文学科）and social sciences must remain central components of America’s educational system at all levels. Both areas are critical to producing citizens who can participate effectively in our democratic society, become	 innovative(创新的）leaders, and benefit from the spiritual enrichment that the reflection on the great ideas of mankind over time provides.
　　Parents and students who have invested heavily in higher education worry about graduates, job prospects as technological advances and changes in domestic and global markets transform professions in ways that reduce wages and cut jobs. Under these circumstances, it’s natural to look for what may appear to be the most “practical” way out of the problem: “Major in a subject designed to get you a job” seems the obvious answer to some, though this ignores the fact that many disciplines in the humanities characterized as “soft” often, in fact, lead to employment and success in the long run. Indeed, according to surveys, employers have expressed a preference for students who have received a broadly-based education that has taught them to write well, think critically, research creatively, and communicate easily.
　　Moreover, students should be prepared not just for their first job, but for their 4th and 5th jobs, as there’s little reason to doubt that people entering the workforce today will be called upon to play many different roles over the course of their careers. The ones who will do the best in this new environment will be those whose educations have prepared them to	be flexible. The ability to draw upon every available tool and insight—picked up from science, arts, and technology—to solve the problems of the future, and take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves, will be helpful to them and the United States.
56.What does the latest congressional report suggest?
　　A)STEM-related subjects help students find jobs in the information society.
　　B)The humanities and STEM subjects should be given equal importance.
　　C)The liberal arts in higher education help enrich students’ spiritual life.
　　D)Higher education should be adjusted to the practical needs of society.
57.What is the main concern of students when they choose a major?
　　A)Their interest in relevant subjects.	C)	The quality of education to receive.
　　B)The academic value of the courses.	D)	Their chances of getting a good job.
58.What does the author say about the so-called soft subjects?
　　A)They benefit students in their future life.
　　B)They broaden students’ range of interests.
　　C)They improve students’ communication skills.
　　D)They are essential to students’ healthy growth.
59.What kind of job applicants do employers look for?
　　A)Those who have a strong sense of responsibility.
　　B)Those who are good at solving practical problems.
　　C)Those who are likely to become innovative leaders.
　　D)Those who have received a well-rounded education.
60.What advice does the author give to college students?
　　A)   Seize opportunities to tap their potential.	C) Prepare themselves for different job options.
　　B)  Try to take a variety of practical courses.	D) Adopt a flexible approach to solving problems.
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　Energy independence. It has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? If you think so, you’re not alone, because energy independence has been the dream of American presidents for decades, and never more so than in the past few years, when the most recent oil price shock has been partly responsible for kicking off the great recession.
　　“Energy independence” and its rhetorical(修辞的）companion “energy security” are, however, slippery concepts that are rarely thought through. What is it we want independence from, exactly?
　　Most people would probably say that they want to be independent from imported oil. But there are reasons that we buy all that oil from elsewhere.
　　The first reason is that we need it to keep our economy running. Yes, there is a trickle(涓涓细流）of biofuel（生物燃料）available, and more may become available, but most biofuels cause economic waste and environmental destruction.
　　Second, Americans have basically decided that they don’t really want to produce all their own oil. They value the environmental quality they preserve over their oil imports from abroad. Vast areas of the United States are off-limits to oil exploration and production in the name of environmental protection. To what extent are Americans really willing to endure the environmental impacts of domestic energy production in order to cut back imports?
　　Third, there are benefits to trade. It allows for economic efficiency, and when we buy things from places that have lower production costs than we do, we benefit. And although you don’t read about this much, the United States is also a large exporter of oil products, selling about 2 million barrels of petroleum products per day to about 90 countries.
　　There is no question that the United States imports a great deal of energy and, in fact, relies on that steady flow to maintain its economy. When that flow is interrupted, we feel the pain in short supplies and higher prices. At the same time, we derive massive economic benefits when we buy the most affordable energy on the world market and when we engage in energy trade around the world.
61.What does the author say about energy independence for America?
　　　A) It sounds very attractive.	C) It will bring oil prices down.
　　　B)  It ensures national security.	D) It has long been everyone’s dream.
62.What does the author think of biofuels?
　　A)They keep America’s economy running healthily.
　　B)They prove to be a good alternative to petroleum.
　　C)They do not provide a sustainable energy supply.
　　D)They cause serious damage to the environment.
63.Why does America rely heavily on oil imports?
　　A)It wants to expand its storage of crude oil.
　　B)Its own oil reserves are quickly running out.
　　C)It wants to keep its own environment intact.
　　D)Its own oil production falls short of demand.
64.What does the author say about oil trade?
　　A)  It proves profitable to both sides.	C) It makes for economic prosperity.
　　B)  It improves economic efficiency.	D) It saves the cost of oil exploration.
65.What is the author’s purpose in writing the passage?
　　A)To justify America’s dependence on oil imports.
　　B)To arouse Americans’ awareness of the energy crisis.
　　C)To stress the importance of energy conservation.
　　D)To explain the increase of international oil trade.

　　　Almost every child, on the first day he sets foot in a school building, is smarter, more    26   , less afraid of what he doesn’t know, better at finding and    27    , more confident, resourceful（机敏的）,persistent and    28    than he will ever be again in his schooling—or, unless he is very unusual and very lucky, for the rest of his life. Already, by paying close attention to and    29    the world and people around him, and without any school-type formal instruction, he has done a task far more difficult, complicated and    30    than anything he will be asked to do in school, or than any of his teachers has done for years. He has solved the    31    of language. He has discovered it—babies don’t even know that language exists—and he has found out how it works and learnt to use it   32   .  He has done it by exploring, by experimenting, by developing his own model of the grammar of language, by    33    and seeing whether it works by gradually changing it and    34    it until it does work. And while he has been doing this, he has been learning other things as well, including many of the    35    that the schools think only they can teach him, and many that are more complicated than the ones they do try to teach him.

Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　　The fact is, the world has been finding less oil than it has been using for more than twenty years now. Not only has demand been    36	 , but the oil we have been finding is coming from places that are    37    to reach. At the same time, more of this newly    38    oil is of the type that requires a greater investment to    39    . And because demand for this precious resource will grow, according to some, by over 40 percent by 2025, fueling the world’s economic    40    will take a lot more energy from every possible source. 
　　　　The energy industry needs to get more from existing fields while continuing to search for new    41    . Automakers must continue to improve fuel efficiency and perfect hybrid (混合动力的）vehicles. Technological improvements are needed so that wind, solar and hydrogen can be more     42     parts of the energy equation. Governments need to formulate energy policies that promote    43    and environmentally sound development. Consumers must be willing to pay for some of these solutions, while practicing conservation efforts of their own.
　　　Inaction is not an    44    . So let’s work together to balance this equation. We are taking some of the    45    needed to get started, but we need your help to go the rest of the way.


Section B
Directions ： In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
I Cry, Therefore I Am
C)In 2008, at a German zoo, a gorilla(大猩猩）named Gana gave birth to a male infant, who died after three months. Photographs of Gana, looking stricken and inconsolable (伤心欲绝的）, attracted crowds to the zoo. Sad as the scene was, the humans, not Gana, were the only ones crying. The notion that animals can weep has no scientific basis. Years of observations by biologists Dian Fossey, who observed gorillas, and Jane Goodall, who worked with chimpanzees (黑猩猩), could not prove that animals cry tears from emotion.
D)It’s true that many animals shed tears, especially in response to pain. Tears protect the eye by keeping it moist. But crying as an expression of feeling is unique to humans and has played an essential role in human evolution and the development of human cultures.
E)Within two days an infant can imitate sad and happy faces. If an infant does not cry out, it is unlikely to get the attention it needs to survive. Around 3-4 months, the relationship between the human infant and its environment takes on a more organized communicative role, and tearful crying begins to serve interpersonal purposes: the search for comfort and pacification (抚慰). As we get older, crying becomes a tool of social interaction: grief and joy, shame and pride, fear and manipulation.
F)Tears are as universal as laughter, and grief is more complex than joy. But although we all cry, we do so in different ways. Women cry more frequently and intensely than men, especially when exposed to emotional events. Like crying, depression is, around the world, more commonly seen in women than in men. One explanation might be that women, who despite decades of social advances still suffer from economic inequality, discrimination (歧视) and even violence, might have more to cry about. Men not only cry for shorter periods than women, but they also are less inclined to explain their tears, usually shed them more quietly, and tend more frequently to apologize when they cry openly. Men, like women, report crying at the death of a loved one and in response to a moving religious experience. They are more likely than women to cry when their core identities—as providers and protectors, as fathers and fighters—are questioned.
G)People who score on personality tests as more sympathetic cry more than those who are more rigid or have more self-control. Frequency of crying varies widely: some shed tears at any novel or movie, others only a handful of times in their lives. Crying in response to stress and conflict in the home, or after emotional trauma (创伤), lasts much longer than tears induced by everyday sadness—which in turn last longer than tears of delight and joy.
H)Sadness is our primary association with crying, but the fact is that people report feeling happier after crying. Surveys estimate that 85% of women and 73% of men report feeling better after shedding tears. Surprisingly, crying is more commonly associated with minor forms of depression than with major depression involving suicidal thoughts.
I)People widely report that crying relieves tension, restores emotional balance and provides “catharsis,” a washing out of bad feelings. The term “catharsis” has religious implications of removing evil and sin; it’s no surprise that religious ceremonies are, around the world, one of the main settings for the release of tears.
J)Crying is a nearly universal sign of grief, though some mourners report that, despite genuine sorrow, they cannot shed tears—sometimes even for years after their loved one has gone. Unlike today, when the privacy of grief is more respected, the public or ceremonial shedding of tears, at the graveside of a spouse or the funeral of a king or queen, was once considered socially or even politically essential.
K)Crying has also served other social purposes. Rousseau wrote in his Confessions that while he considered tears the most powerful expression of love, he also just liked to cry over nothing.
L)The association of tears with art has ancient roots. The classic Greek tragedies of the fifth century B. C. were primarily celebrations of gods. Tragedies, like poetry and music, were staged religious events. Even then it was recognized that crying in response to drama brought pleasure.
K)    I have argued that there are neurobiological(神经生物方面的）associations linking the arts and mood disorders. When I lecture on crying, I ask my audience to let me know, by a show of hands, which art forms most move them to tears. About 80% say music, followed closely by novels (74% ), but then the figures fall sharply, to 43% , for poetry, and 10 -22% for paintings, sculpture and architecture.
L)  The physical act of crying is mainly one of breathing in air, which is why we choke up when we weep. This suggests to language scientists that emotional crying evolved before language, perhaps explaining why tears communicate states of mind and feelings that are often so difficult to express in words. Of course, from an evolutionary perspective, recognition of emotion (usually through facial gesture) was essential for survival.
M)   The earliest humans arrived several million years ago, but only 150,000 to 200,000 years ago, did cultures, language, religion and the arts arise. Along the way, tears became more than a biological necessity to lubricate（润滑）the eye and developed into a sign of intense emotion and a signal of social bonding. The development of self-consciousness and the notion of individual identity, or ego; storytelling about the origins of the world, the creation of humanity and life after death; and the ability to feel others, sadness—all were critical parts of the neurobiological changes that made us human.
N)   More recently, we’ve learned from neuroscience that certain brain circuits（回路）are activated(激活), rapidly and unconsciously, when we see another in emotional distress. In short, our brain evolved circuits to allow us to experience sympathy, which in turn made civilization, and an ethics based on sympathy, possible. So the next time you reach a tissue box, or sob on a Mend’s shoulder, or shed tears at the movies, stop and reflect on why we cry and what it means to cry. Because ultimately,  while we love to cry,  we also cry to love.
E)Nowadays people respect the privacy of grief more than in the past.
F)Infants cry to attract attention for survival.
G)There is no scientific evidence as yet that animals can shed tears from emotion.
H)Tears can perform certain communicative functions which words cannot.
I)Our ability to experience sympathy is essential to the development of civilization.
J)People are more inclined to cry when suffering minor forms of depression.
K)Sometimes people cannot cry despite genuine grief.
L)In humans, long history, tears have developed an essential role in social relationships.
M)Men are less likely to give reasons for their tears.
N)Crying has long been associated with art.
Section C
Directions ： There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),  B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　　Hospitals, hoping to curb medical error, have invested heavily to put computers, smartphones and other devices into the hands of medical staff for instant access to patient data, drug information and case studies.
　　　But like many cures, this solution has come with an unintended side effect: doctors and nurses can be focused on the screen and not the patient, even during moments of critical care. A poll showed that half of medical technicians had admitted texting during a procedure.
　　　This phenomenon has set off an intensifying discussion at hospitals and medical schools about a problem perhaps best described as “distracted doctoring.” In response, some hospitals have begun limiting the use of electronic devices in critical settings, while schools have started reminding medical students to focus on patients instead of devices.
　　　“You justify carrying devices around the hospital to do medical records, but you can surf the Internet or do Facebook, and sometimes Facebook is more tempting,” said Dr. Peter Papadakos at the University of Rochester Medical Center.
　　　“My gut feeling（本能的感觉）is lives are in danger,” said Dr. Papadakos. “We’re not educating people about the problem, and ifs getting worse.”
　　　A survey of 439 medical technicians found that 55 percent of technicians who monitor bypass machines acknowledged that they had talked on cellphones during heart surgery. Half said they had texted while in surgery. The study concluded, “ Such distractions have the potential to be disastrous.”
　　Medical professionals have always faced interruptions from cellphones, and multitasking is simply a fact of life for many medical jobs. What has changed, say doctors, especially younger ones, is that they face increasing pressure to interact with their devices.
　　The pressure stems from a mantra(信条）of modem medicine that patient care must be “data driven,” and informed by the latest, instantly accessible information. By many accounts, the technology has helped reduce medical error by providing instant access to patient data or prescription details.
　　Dr. Peter Carmel, president of the American Medical Association, said technology “offers great potential in health care,” but he added that doctors, first priority should be with the patient.
E)Why do hospitals equip their staff with computers, smartphones and other devices?
　　A) To reduce medical error.	C) To facilitate administration.
　　B)  To cope with emergencies.	D) To simplify medical procedures.
F)What does the author refer to by “distracted doctoring” ?
　　E)The disservice done by modem devices to doctors, nurses, as well as patients.
　　F)The tendency of medical institutions encouraging the use of modem devices.
　　G)The problem of devices preventing doctors from focusing on their patients.
　　H)The phenomenon of medical staff attending to personal affairs while working.
G)What does Dr. Peter Papadakos worry about?
　　C)Medical students are not adequately trained to use modem technology.
　　D)Doctors’ interaction with their devices may endanger patients, lives.
　　E)Doctors are relying too heavily on modem electronic technology.
　　F)Pressures on the medical profession may become overwhelming.
H)Why do doctors feel increasing pressure to use modem devices?
　　C)Patients trust doctors who use modem technology.
　　D)Use of modem devices adds hospitals’ revenues.
　　E)Data is given too much importance in patient care.
　　F)Patients’ data has to be revised from time to time.
I)What is Peter Carmel’s advice to doctors?
　　E)They follow closely the advances in medical science.
　　F)They focus their attention on the patient’s condition.
　　G)They observe hospital rules and regulations.
　　H)They make the best use of modem devices.
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　I have closely watched my generation, known as The Millennials, for 29 years now. Joel Stein wrote an extensive piece on Millennials and he remains rather optimistic about our potential.
　　I hesitate to share his optimism because of paradox (矛盾的现象）we seem to exhibit, namely, that there are more avenues for us to entertain ourselves than ever before, yet we are more bored than ever before.
　　Entertainment has never been more varied. We have more cable channels, television shows, and movies than ever before. Internet providers allow instant viewing of almost any movie or television program ever created. Social drinking and partying are also widely available for Millennials. Every generation develops these habits at a certain age, but Millennials seem to be extending this phase of life as they postpone marriage.
　　Some of this is undoubtedly due to The Great Recession. Milleimials are having a difficult time finding jobs; only 47 percent of 16-to-24-year-olds are employed, the smallest share since government started recording data in 1948.
　　But do Millennials respond to these economic troubles by doing whatever it takes to make ends meet? Hardly. In fact, of the four generations Pew Research has data for, the Milennial generation does not cite work ethic（勤奋工作）	as distinctive of itself. Millennials want to save the world, but they sit and wait for that world-changing opportunity to be handed to them. Instead of working 2-3 jobs, launching a business, or doing what it takes to succeed, they retreat. Millennials may be the first generation to have a lower standard of living than their parents, but with this response to adversity (逆境), perhaps deservingly so.
　　Much ink has been spilled in management books discussing how to get the most out of these youths in the workplace. Largely, they come to the same conclusion: Millennials are entitled, over-confident, and expect too much too quickly. We should not be surprised. Today’s young adults were raised by parents who made sure to boost their self-esteem at every turn, telling them they could achieve whatever they set their minds to, and handing out prizes for the sixth place.
E)What does the author of the passage think of Millennials?
　　20.They show little interest in entertainment.
　　21.They are not confident about their ability.
　　22.They enjoy an easy life due to high technology.
　　23.They may not have bright prospects for success.
F)How do Millennials feel about their life?
　　C)They can hardly do anything about it.	C)	It is not as good as their parents’.
　　D)There is little in it to get excited about.	D)	It is full of opportunities for success.
G)In what way are Millennials different from previous generations according to Pew Research?
　　E)They spend less time socializing.	C)	They do not value hard work.
　　F)They are indifferent to others.-	D)	They are more independent.
H)What should Millennials do according to the author?
　　D)Remain optimistic in face of adversity.	C)	Make full use of new opportunities.
　　E)Start a business as early as possible.	D)	Take action to change their situation.
I)Why are Millennials over-confident about themselves?
　　A)     They have been spoiled by their parents.	C)	They are misguided by management books.
　　B)    They can always get whatever they expect.	D)	They think they are young and energetic.

　　　Among the kinds of social gestures most significant .for second-language teachers are those which are   26    in form but different .in meaning in the two cultures. For example, a Colombian who wants someone to   27   him often signals with a hand movement in which all the fingers of one hand, cupped, point downward as they move rapidly     28 . Speakers of English have a similar gesture though the hand may not be cupped .and the fingers may be held more loosely, but for them the gesture means goodbye or go away, quite the   29    of the Colombian gesture. Again, in Columbia, a speaker of English would have to know that when he 30 height he must choose between different gestures depending on whether he is 31   a human being or an animal. If he keeps the palm of the hand    32     the floor, as he would in his own culture when making known the height of a child, for example, he will very likely be greeted by laughter, in Colombia this gesture is 33 for the description of animals. In order to describe human beings he should keep the palm of his hand     34 to the floor. Substitutions of one gesture for the other often create not only humorous but also 35 moments. In both of the examples above, speakers from two different cultures have the same gesture, physically, but its meaning differs sharply.

Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　　Many Brazilians cannot read. In 2000, a quarter of those aged 15 and older were functionally illiterate (文盲). Many 36 do not want to. Only one literate adult in three reads book. The 37 Brazilian reads 1.8 non-academic books a year, less than half the figure in Europe and the United States. In a recent survey of reading habits, Brazilians came 27th out of 30 countries. Argentines, their neighbours, 38 18th.

　　　The government and businesses are all struggling in different ways to change this. On March 13 the government    39     a National Plan for Books and Reading. This seeks to boost reading, by founding libraries and financing publishers among other things.
　　　One discouragement to reading is that books are 40 . Most books have small print-runs, pushing up their price.
　　　But Brazilians’ indifference to books has deeper roots. Centuries of slavery meant the country’s leaders long 41 education. Primary schooling became universal only in the 1990s.
　　　All this means Brazil’s book market has the biggest growth 42 in the western world.
　　　But reading is a difficult habit to form. Brazilians bought fewer books in 2004, 89 million, including textbooks 43 by the government, than they did in 1991. Last year the director of Brazil’s national library 44 . He complained that he had haft the librarians he needed and termites (白蚁) had eaten much of the 45 . That ought to be a cause for national shame.

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
The Touch-Screen Generation
[A]On a chilly day last spring, a few dozen developers of children’s apps (应用程序) for phones and tablets ( 平板电脑) gathered at an old beach resort in Monterey, California, to show off their games. The gathering was organized by Warren Buckleitner, a longtime reviewer of interactive children’s media. Buckleitner

spent the breaks testing whether his own remote-control helicopter could reach the hall’s .second story, while various children who had come with their parents looked up in awe (敬畏) and delight. But mostly they looked down, at the iPads and other tablets displayed around the hall like so many open boxes of candy. I walked around and talked with developers, and several quoted a famous saying of Maria Montessori’s, “The hands are the instruments of man’s intelligence.”

[B]	What, really, would Maria Montessori have made of this scene? The 30 or so children here were not down at the shore poking (戳) their fingers in the sand or running them along stones or picking seashells. Instead they were all inside, alone or in groups of two or three, their faces a few inches from a screen, their hands doing things Montessori surely did not imagine.

[C]	In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated .its policy on very young children and media. In 1999, the group had discouraged television viewing for children younger than 2, citing research on brain development that showed this age group’s critical need for “direct interactions with parents and other significant care givers.” The updated report began by acknowledging that things had changed significantly since then. In 2006, 90% of parents said that their children younger than 2 consumed some form of electronic media. Nevertheless, the group took largely the same approach it did in1999, uniformly discouraging passive media use, on any type of screen, for these kids. (For older children, the academy noted, “high-quality programs” could have “educational benefits”.) The 2011 report mentioned “smart cell phone” and “new screen” technologies, but did not address interactive apps. Nor did it bring up the possibility that has likely occurred to those 90% of American parents that some good might come from those little swiping (在电子产品上刷) fingers.

[D]I had come to the developers’ conference partly because I hoped that this particular set of parents, enthusiastic as they were about interactive media, might help me out of this problem, that they might offer some guiding principle for American parents who are clearly never going to meet the academy’s ideals, and at some level do not want to. Perhaps this group would be able to express clearly some benefits of the new technology that the more cautious doctors weren’t ready to address.

[E]I fell into conversation with a woman who had helped develop Montessori Letter Sounds, an app that teaches preschoolers the Montessori methods of spelling. She was a former Montessori teacher and a mother of four. I myself have three children who are all fans of the touch screen. What games did her kids like to play, I asked, hoping for suggestions I could take home.
“They don’t play all that much.” Really? Why not?
“Because I don’t allow it. We have a rule of no screen time during the week, unless it’s clearly educational.”
No screen time? None at all? That seems at the outer edge of restrictive, even by the standards of overcontrolling parents.
“On the weekends, they can play. I give them a limit of half an hour and then stop. Enough.”

[F]Her answer so surprised me that I decided to ask some of the other developers who were also parents what their domestic ground rules for screen time were. One said only on airplanes and long car rides. Another said Wednesdays and weekends, for half an hour. The most permissive said half an hour a day, which was about my rule at home. At one point I sat with one of the biggest developers of e-book apps for kids, and his family. The small kid was starting to fuss in her highchair, so the morn stuck an iPad in front of her and played a short movie so everyone else could enjoy their lunch. When she saw me watching, she gave me the universal tense look of mothers who feel they are being judged. “At home,” she assured me, “I only let her watch movies in Spanish.”

[G]By their reactions, these parents made me understand the problem of our age: as technology becomes almost everywhere in our lives, American parents are becoming more, not less, distrustful of what it might be doing to their children. Technological ability has not, for parents, translated into comfort and ease. On the one hand, parents want their children to swim expertly in the digital stream that they will have to navigate (航行) all their lives; on the other hand, they fear that too much digital media, too early, will sink them. Parents end up treating tablets as precision surgical ( 外科的)instruments, devices that might perform miracles for their child’s IQ and help him win some great robotics competition—but only if they are used just so. Otherwise, their child could end up one of those sad, pale creatures who can’t make eye contact and has a girlfriend who lives only in the virtual world.


[H]Norman Rockwell, a 20th-century artist, never painted Boy Swiping Finger on Screen, and our own vision of a perfect childhood has never been adjusted to accommodate that now-common scene. Add to that our modern fear that every parenting decision may have lasting consequences—that every minute of enrichment lost or mindless entertainment indulged ( 放纵的) will add up to
some permanent handicap ( 障碍) in the future and you have deep guilt and
confusion. To date, no body of research has proved that the iPad will make your preschooler smarter or teach her to speak Chinese, or alternatively that it will rust her nervous system—the device has been out for only three years, not much more than the time it takes some academics to find funding and gather research subjects. So what m a parent to do?

46.The author attended the conference, hoping to find some guiding principles for parenting in the electronic age.
47.American parents are becoming more doubtful about the benefits technology is said to bring to their children.
48.Some experts believe that human intelligence develops by the use of hands.
49.The author found a former Montessori teacher exercising strict control over her kids’ screen time.
50.Research shows interaction with people is key to babies’ brain development.
51.So far there has been no scientific proof of the educational benefits of iPads.
52.American parents worry that overuse of tablets will create problems with their kids’ interpersonal relationships.
53.The author expected developers of children’s apps to specify the benefits of the new technology.
54.The kids at the gathering were more fascinated by the iPads than by the helicopter.
55.The author permits her children to use the screen for at most half an hour a day.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on following passage.

　　　When young women were found to make only 82 percent of what their male peers do just one year out of college, many were at a loss to explain it.
　　　All the traditional reasons put forward to interpret the pay gap—that women fall behind when they leave the workforce to raise kids, for example, or that they don’t seek as many management roles failed to justify this one. These young women didn’t have kids yet. And because they were just one year removed from their undergraduate degrees, few of these women yet had the chance to go after (much less decline) leadership roles.
　　　But there are other reasons why the pay gap remains so persistent. The first is that no matter how many women may be getting college degrees, the university experience is still an unequal one. The second is that our higher education system is not designed to focus on the economic consequences of our students’ years on campus.
　　　Now that women are the majority of college students and surpass men in both the number of undergraduate and advanced degrees awarded, one might think the college campus m a pretty equal place. It is not. Studies show that while girls do better than boys in high school, they start to trail off during their college years. They enroll in different kinds of classes, tend to major in less rigorous ( 非常严格的) subjects, and generally head off with less ambitious plans.
　　　As a result, it’s not surprising that even the best educated young women enter the workplace with a slight disadvantage. Their college experience leaves them somewhat confused, still stumbling ( 栽倒) over the dilemmas their grandmothers’ generation sought to destroy. Are they supposed to be pretty or smart? Strong or sexy (性感的)? All their lives, today’s young women have been pushed to embrace both perfection and passion to pursue science and sports, math and theater—and do it all as well as they possibly can No wonder they are not negotiating for higher salaries as soon as
they get out of school. They are too exhausted, and too scared of failing.
56.Traditionally, it is believed that women earn less than men because	.
A)they have failed to take as many rigorous courses
B)they do not feel as fit for management roles
C)they feel .obliged to take care of their kids at home
D)they do not exhibit the needed leadership qualifies
57.What does the author say about America’s higher education system?
A)It does not offer specific career counseling to women.
B)It does not consider its economic impact on graduates.
C)It does not take care of women students’ special needs.
D)It does not encourage women to take rigorous subjects.

58.What does the author say about, today’s college experience?
A)It is different for male and female students.
B)It is not the same as that of earlier generations.
C)It is more exhausting than most women expect.
D)It is not so satisfying to many American students.
59.What does the author say about women students in college?
A)They have no idea how to bring out their best.
B)They drop a course when they find it too rigorous.
C)They are not as practical as men in choosing courses.
D)They don’t perform as well as they did in high school.
60.How does the author explain the pay gap between men and women fresh from college?
A)Women are too worn out to be ambitious.
B)Women are not ready to take management roles.
C)Women are caught between career and family.
D)Women are not good at negotiating salaries.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　　Reading leadership literature, you’d sometimes think that everyone has the potential to be an effective leader.
　　　I don’t believe that to be true. In fact, I see way fewer truly effective leaders than I see people stuck in positions of leadership who are sadly incompetent and seriously misguided about their own abilities.
Part of the reason this happens is a lack of honest self-assessment by those who
aspire to (追求) leadership in the first place.
　　　We’ve all met the type of Individual who simply must take charge. Whether it’s a decision-making session, a basketball game, or a family outing, they can’t help grabbing the lead dog position and clinging on to it for dear life. They believe they’re natural born leaders.
　　　Truth is, they’re nothing of the sort. True leaders don’t assume that it’s their divine ( 神圣的) right to take charge every time two or more people get together. Quite the opposite. A great leader will assess each situation on its merits, and will only take charge when their position, the situation, and/or the needs of the moment demand it.
　　　Many business executives confuse leadership with action. They believe that constant motion somehow generates leadership as a byproduct. Faced with any

situation that can’t be solved by the sheer force of activity, they generate a dust cloud of impatience. Their one leadership tool is volume: if they think you aren’t working as hard as they think you should, their demands become increasingly louder and harsher.
　　　True leaders understand the value of action, of course, but it isn’t their only tool. In fact, it isn’t even their primary tool. Great leaders see more than everyone else: answers, solutions, patterns, problems, opportunities. They know it’s vitally important to do, but they also know that thinking, understanding, reflection and interpretation are equally important.
　　　If you’re too concerned with outcomes to the extent that you manipulate and intimidate others to achieve those outcomes, then you aren’t leading at all, you’re dictating. A true leader is someone who develops his or her team so that they can and do hit their targets and achieve their goals.
61.What does the author think of the leaders he knows?
A.Many of them are used to taking charge.
B.Few of them are equal to their positions.
C.Many of them fail to fully develop their potential.
D.Few of them are familiar with leadership literature.
62.Why are some people eager to grab leadership positions?
A.They believe they have the natural gift to lead.
B.They believe in what leadership literature says.
C.They have proved competent in many situations.
D.They derive great satisfaction from being leaders.
63.What characterizes a great leader according to the author?
A.Being able to take prompt action when chances present themselves.
B.Having a whole-hearted dedication to their divine responsibilities.
C.Having a full understanding of their own merits and weaknesses.
D.Being able to assess the situation carefully, before taking charge.
64.How will many business executives respond when their command fails to generate action?
A.They reassess the situation at hand.
B.They become impatient and rude.
C.They resort to any tool available.
D.They blame their team members.
65.What is the author’s advice to leaders?
A.Concentrate on one specific task at a time.
B.Use different tools to achieve different goals.
C.Build up a strong mare to achieve their goals.

D.Show determination when faced with tough tasks.

Part III  Reading Comprehension  (40 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
     One principle of taxation, called the benefit principle, states that people should pay taxes based on the benefits they receive from government services. This principle tries to make public goods similar to __36__ goods. It seems reasonable that a person who often goes to the movies pays more in __37__ for movie tickets than a person who rarely goes.And __38__ a person who gets great benefit from a public good should pay more for it than a person who gets little benefit.
     The gasoline tax, for instance, is sometimes __39__ using the benefits principle. In some states, __40__ from the gasoline tax are used to build and maintain roads. Because those who buy gasoline are the same people who use the roads, the gasoline tax might be viewed as a __41__ way to pay this government service.
     The benefits principle can also be used to argue that wealthy citizens should pay higher taxes than poorer ones, __42__ because the wealthy benefit more from public services. Consider, for example, the benefits of police protection from __43__.Citizens with much to protect get greater benefit from police than those with less to protect.Therefore, according to the benefits principle, the wealthy should __44__ more than the poor to the cost of __45__ the police force. The same argument can be used for many other public services, such as fire protection, national defense, and the court system.

Growing Up Colored
[A] You wouldn't know Piedmont anymore—my Piedmont, I mean—the town in West Virginia where I learned to be a colored boy.
[B] The 1950s in Piedmont was a time to remember, or at least to me. People were always proud to be from Piedmont—lying at the foot of a mountain, on the banks of the mighty Potomac. We knew God gave America no more beautiful location. In ever knew colored people anywhere who were crazier about mountains and water,flowers and trees, fishing and hunting. For as long as anyone could remember, we could out hunt, out shoot, and out swim the white boys in the valley.
[C] The social structure of Piedmont was something we knew like the back of our hands.It was an immigrant town; white Piedmont was Italian and Irish, with a handful of wealthy WASPs (盎格鲁撒克逊裔的白人新教徒) on East Hampshire Street, and"ethnic" neighborhoods of working-class people everywhere else, colored and white.
[D] For as long as anyone can remember, Piedmont's character has been completely bound up with the West vaco paper mill: its prosperous past and doubtful future. At first glance, the town is a typical dying mill center. Many once beautiful buildings stand empty, evidencing a bygone time of spirit and pride. The big houses on East Hampshire Street are no longer proud, as they were when I was a kid.
[E] Like the Italians and the Irish, most of the colored people migrated to Piedmont at the turn of the 20th century to work at the paper mill, which opened in 1888. All the colored men at the paper mill worked on "the platform"—loading paper into trucks until the craft unions were finally integrated in 1968. Loading is what Daddy did every working day of his life. That's what almost every colored grown-up I knew did.
[F] Colored people lived in three neighborhoods that were clearly separated. Welcome to the Colored Zone, a large stretched banner could have said. And it felt good in there, like walking around your house in bare feet and underwear, or snoring right out loud on the couch in front of the TV—enveloped by the comforts of home, the warmth of those you love.
[G] Of course, the colored world was not so much a neighborhood as a condition of existence. And though our own world was seemingly self-contained, it impacted on the white world of Piedmont in almost every direction. Certainly, the borders of our world seemed to be impacted on when some white man or woman showed up where he or she did not belong, such as at the black Legion Hall. Our space was violated when one of them showed up at a dance or a party. The rhythms would be off. The music would sound not quite right: attempts to pat the beat off just so.Everybody would leave early.
[H] Before 1955, most white people were just shadowy presences in our world, vague figures of power like remote bosses at the mill or tellers at the bank. There were exceptions, of course, the white people who would come into our world in ritualized,everyday ways we all understood. Mr. Mail Man, Mr. Insurance Man, Mr.White-and-Chocolate Milk Man, Mr. Landlord Man, Mr. Police Man: we called white people by their trade, like characters in a mystery play. Mr. Insurance Man would come by every other week to collect premiums on college or death policies,sometimes 50 cents or less.
[I] "It's no disgrace to be colored," the black entertainer Bert Williams famously observed early in the century, "but it is awfully inconvenient." For most of my childhood, we couldn't cat in restaurants or sleep in hotels, we couldn't use certain bathrooms or try on clothes in stores. Mama insisted that we dress up when we went to shop. She was carefully dressed when she went to clothing stores, and wore white pads called shields under her arms so her dress or blouse would show no sweat."We'd like to try this on," she'd say carefully, uttering her words precisely and properly. "We don't buy clothes we can't try on," she'd say when they declined, and we'd walk out in Mama's dignified (有尊严的) manner. She preferred to shop where we had an account and where everyone knew who she was.
[J] At the Cut-Rate Drug Store, no one colored was allowed to sit down at the counter or tables, with one exception: my father. I don't know for certain why CarlDadisman, the owner, wouldn't stop Daddy from sitting down. But I believe it was in part because Daddy was so light-colored, and in part because, during his shift at the phone company, he picked up orders for food and coffee for the operators.Colored people were supposed to stand at the counter, get their food to go, and leave. Even when Young Doc Bess would set up the basketball team with free Cokes after one of many victories, the colored players had to stand around and drink out of paper cups while the white players and cheerleaders sat down in comfortable chairs and drank out of glasses.
[K] I couldn't have been much older than five or six as I sat with my father at the Cut-Rate one afternoon, enjoying two scoops of caramel ice cream. Mr. Wilson, astony-faced, brooding Irishman, walked by."Hello, Mr. Wilson," my father said."Hello, George."
[L] I was genuinely puzzled. Mr. Wilson must have confused my father with somebody else, but who? There weren't any Georges among the colored people in Piedmont."Why don't you tell him your name, Daddy?" I asked loudly. "Your name isn't George.""He knows my name, boy," my father said after a long pause. "He calls all colored people George."
[M] I knew we wouldn't talk about it again; even at that age, 1 was given to understand that there were some subjects it didn't do to worry to death about. Now that I have children, I realize that what distressed my father wasn't so much the Mr. Wilsons of the world as the painful obligation to explain the racial facts of life to someone who hadn't quite learned them yet. Maybe Mr. Wilson couldn't hurt my father by calling him George; but I hurt him by asking to know why.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
     Children are a delight. They are our future. But sadly, hiring someone to take care of them while you go to work is getting more expensive by the year.
Earlier this month, it was reported that the cost of enrolling an infant or small kid at a childcare center rose 3% in 2012, faster than the overall cost of living. There are now large strips of the country where daycare for an infant costs more than a tenth of the average married couple's income.
     This is not necessarily a new trend, but it is a somewhat puzzling one. The price of professional childcare has been rising since the 1980s. Yet during that time, pay for professional childcare workers has stood still. Actually caregivers make less today, in real terms, than they did in 1990. Considering that labor costs are responsible for up to80% of a daycare center's expenses, one would expect flat wages to have meant flat prices. So who's to blame for higher childcare costs?
     Childcare is a carefully regulated industry. States lay down rules about how many children each employee is allowed to watch over, the space care centers need per child,and other minute details. And the stricter the regulations, the higher the costs. If it has to hire a caregiver for every two children, it can't really achieve any economies of scale on labor to save money when other expenses go up. In Massachusetts, where childcare centers must hire one teacher for every three infants, the price of care averaged more than $16,000 per year. In Mississippi, where centers must hire one teacher for every five infants, the price of care averaged less than $5,000.
     Unfortunately, I don't have all the daycare-center regulations handy. But I wouldn't be surprised if as the rules have become more elaborate, prices have risen. The trade off (交换) might be worth it in some cases; after all, the health and safety of children should probably come before cheap service. But certainly, it doesn't seem to be an accident that some of the cheapest daycare available is in the least regulated South.

56. What problem do parents of small kids have to face?
   A) The ever-rising childcare prices.
   B) The budgeting of family expenses.
   C) The balance between work and family.
   D) The selection of a good daycare center.
57. What does the author feel puzzled about?
   A) Why the prices of childcare vary greatly from state to state.
   B) Why increased childcare prices have not led to better service.
   C) Why childcare workers' pay has not increased with the rising childcare costs.
   D) Why there is a severe shortage of childcare professional in a number of states.
58. What prevent childcare centers from saving money?
   A) Steady increase in labor costs.
   B) Strict government regulations.
   C) Lack of support from the state.
   D) High administrative expenses.
59. Why is the average cost of childcare in Mississippi much lower than in Massachusetts?
   A) The overall quality of service is not as good.
   B) Payments for caregivers there are not as high.
   C) Living expenses there are comparatively low.
   D) Each teacher is allowed to care for more kids.
60. What is the author's view on daycare service?
   A) Caregivers should receive regular professional training.
   B) Less elaborate rules about childcare might lower costs.
   C) It is crucial to strike a balance between quality and costs.
   D) It is better for different states to learn from each other.

Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.     
     Alex Pang's amusing new book The Distraction Addiction addresses those of us who feel panic without a cellphone or computer. And that, he claims, is pretty much all of us.When we're not online, where we spend four months annually, we're engaged in the stressful work of trying to get online.
     The Distraction Addiction is not framed as a self-help book. It's a thoughtful examination of the danger of our computing overdose and a historical overview of how technological advances change consciousness. A "professional futurist", Pang urges an approach which he calls "contemplative (沉思的) computing." He asks that you pay full attention to "how your mind and body interact with computers and how your attention and creativity are influenced by technology."
     Pang's first job is to free you from common misconception that doing two things at once allows you to get more done. What is commonly called multitasking is, in fact,switch-tasking, and its harmful effects on productivity are well documented. Pang doesn't advocate returning to a preinternet world. Instead, he asks you to "take a more ecological (生态的) view of your relationships with technologies and look for ways devices or media may be making specific tasks easier or faster but at the same time making your work and life harder."
     The Distraction Addiction is particularly fascinating on how technologies have changed certain field of labor—often for the worse. For architects, computer-aided design has become essential but in some ways has cheapened the design process. As one architect puts it, "Architecture is first and foremost about thinking... and drawing is a more productive way of thinking" than computer-aided design. Somewhat less amusing are Pang's solutions for kicking the Internet habit. He recommends the usual behavior-modification approaches, familiar to anyone who has completed a quit-smoking program. Keep logs to study your online profile and decide what you can knock out, download a program like Freedom that locks you out of your browser, or take a "digital Sabbath (安息日)" ; "Unless you're a reporter or emergency-department doctor,you'll discover that your world doesn't fall apart when you go offline."

　　Stunt people (替身演员) are not movie stars, but they are the hidden heroes of many movies. They were around long before films. Even Shakespeare may have used them in fight scenes. To be good, a fight scene has to look real. Punches must   26   enemies’ jaws. Sword fights must be fought with   27   swords. Several actors are usually in a fight scene. Their moves must be set up so that no one gets hurt. It is almost like planning a dance performance.
　　If a movie scene is dangerous, stunt people usually    28      the stars. You may think you see Tom Cruise running along the top of a train. But it is   29   his stunt double. Stunt people must    30   the stars they stand in for. Their height and build should be about the same. But when close-ups are needed, the film   31   the star. 
　　Some stunt people   32   in certain kinds of scenes. For instance, a stunt woman named Jan Davis does all kinds of jumps. She has leapt from planes and even off the top of a waterfall. Each jump required careful planning and expert   33   .

Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　As an Alaskan fisherman, Timothy June, 54, used to think that he was safe from industrial  pollutants(污染物）at his home in Haines—a town with a population of 2,400 people and 4,000 eagles, with 8 million acres of protected wild land nearby. But in early 2007, June agreed to take part in a   36   of 35 Americans from seven states. It was a biomonitoring project, in which people’s blood and urine (尿) were tested for   37   of chemicals—in this case, three potentially dangerous classes of compounds found in common household   38   like face cream, tin cans, and shower curtains. The results—    39   in November in a report called “Is It in Us?” by an environmental group—were rather worrying. Every one of the participants,   40   from an Illinois state senator to a Massachusetts minister, tested positive for all three classes of pollutants. And while the   41   presence of these chemicals does not   42   indicate a health risk, the fact that typical Americans carry these chemicals at all   43   June and his fellow participants.
　　　Clearly, there are chemicals in our bodies that don’t   44   there. A large, ongoing study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found 148 chemicals in Americans of all ages. And in 2005, the Environmental Working Group found an   45   of 200 chemicals in the blood of 10 new-borns. “Our babies are being born pre-polluted,” says Sharyle Patton of Commonweal, which cosponsored “Is It in Us?” “This is going to be the next big environmental issue after climate change. ”
　　　


Section B
Directions： In this section, you are-going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
In Hard Economy for All Ages, Older Isn’t Better…It’s Brutal
P)Young graduates are in debt, out of work and on their parents’ couches. People in their 30s and 40s can’t afford to buy homes or have children. Retirees are earning near-zero interest on their savings.
Q)In the current listless (缺乏活力的）economy, every generation has a claim to having been most injured. But the Labor Departments latest jobs reports and other recent data present a strong case for crowning baby boomers (二战后生育高峰期出生的人）as the greatest victims of the recession and its dreadful consequences.
R)These Americans in their 50s and early 60s—those near retirement age who do not yet have access to Medicare and Social Security—have lost the most earnings power of any age group, with their household incomes 10 percent below what they made when the recovery began three years ago, according to Sentier Research, a data analysis company. Their retirement savings and home values fell sharply at the worst possible time: just before they needed to cash out. They are supporting both aged parents and unemployed young-adult children, earning them the unlucky nickname “  Generation Squeeze. ’’
66.New research suggests that they may die sooner, because their health, income security and mental well-being were	(重创) by recession at a crucial time in their lives. A recent study by economists at Wellesley College found that people who lost their jobs in the few years before becoming qualified for Social Security lost up to three years from their life expectancy (预期寿命),largely because they no longer had access to affordable health care.
67.Unemployment rates for Americans nearing retirement are far lower than those for young people, who are recently out of school, with fewer skills and a shorter work history. But once out of a job, older workers have a much harder time finding another one. Over the last year, the average duration of unemployment for older people was 53 weeks, compared with 19 weeks for teenagers, according to the Labor Department’s jobs report released on Friday.
68.The lengthy process is partly because older workers are more likely to have been laid off from industries that are downsizing, like manufacturing. Compared with the rest of the population, older people are also more likely to own their own homes and be less mobile than renters, who can move to new job markets.
69.Older workers are more likely to have a disability of some sort, perhaps limiting the range of jobs that offer realistic choices. They may also be less inclined, at least initially, to take jobs that pay far less than their old positions.
70.Displaced boomers also believe they are victims of age discrimination, because employers can easily find a young, energetic worker who will accept lower pay and who can potentially stick around for decades rather than a few years.
71.In a survey of older workers who were laid off during the recession, just one in six had found another job, and half of that group had accepted pay cuts. 14% of the re-employed said the pay in their new job was less than half what they earned in their previous job. “I just say to myself：‘ Why me? What have I done to deserve this?’ ’’ said John Agati， 56，whose last full-time job, as a product developer, ended four years ago when his employer went out of business. That position paid $90,000, and his resume lists jobs at companies like American Express, Disney and USA Networks. Since being laid off, though, he has worked a series of part-time, low-wage, temporary positions, including selling shoes at Lord & Taylor and making sales calls for a car company.
72.The last few years have taken a toll not only on his family’s finances, but also on his feelings of self- worth. “You just get sad,” Mr.  Agati said. “I see people getting up in the morning, going out to their careers and going home. I just wish I was doing that. Some people don’t like their jobs, or they have problems with their jobs, but at least they’re working. I just wish I was in their shoes.” He said he cannot afford to go back to school, as many younger people without jobs have done. Even if he could afford it, economists say it is unclear whether older workers like him benefit much from more education.
73.“It just doesn’t make sense to offer retraining for people 55 and older,” said Daniel Hamermesh, an economics professor. “Discrimination by age, long-term unemployment, and the fact that they’ve now at the end of the hiring queue just don’t make it sensible to invest in them.”
74.Many displaced older workers are taking this message to heart and leaving the labor force entirely. The share of older people applying for Social Security early rose quickly during the recession as people sought whatever income they could find. The penalty they will pay is permanent, as retirees who take benefits at age 62 will receive as much as 30% less in each months check for the rest of their lives than they would if they had waited until full retirement age (66 for those born after 1942).
75.Those not yet qualified for Social Security are increasingly applying for another, comparable kind of income support that often goes to people who expect never to work again： disability benefits. More than one in eight people in their late 50 s is now on some form of federal disability insurance program, according to Professor Mark Duggan at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.
76.The very oldest Americans, of course, were battered by some of the same ill winds that tormented (折磨）those now nearing retirement, but at least the most senior were cushioned by a more readily available social safety net. More important, in a statistical twist, they may have actually benefited from the financial crisis in the most fundamental way: longer lives.
77.Death rates for people over 65 have historically fallen during recessions, according to a November 2011 study by economists at the University of California, Davis. Why? The researchers argue that weak job markets push more workers into accepting relatively undesirable work at nursing homes, leading to better care for residents.
E)Greater mobility puts younger people at an advantage in seeking new jobs.
F)Many of the older workers laid off during the recession had to accept lower pay in their new jobs.
G)Those who lose their jobs shortly before retirement age live a shorter-than-average life.
H)Seniors at nursing homes could benefit from the weak job market.
I)Age discrimination in employment makes it pointless retraining older workers.
J)According to recent reports and data analyses, boomers suffer most from the weak economy.
K)Unemployed boomers are at a disadvantage in job-hunting because employers tend to hire younger workers.
L)People in their fifties and early sixties bear the heaviest family burdens.
M)People who take benefits from Social Security before official retirement age will get much less for the rest of their lives.
N)Older workers5 choice of jobs can be limited because of disability.
Section C
Directions： There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　New Yorkers are gradually getting used to more pedaling (骑车的) passengers on those shining blue Citi Bikes. But what about local bike shops? Is Citi Bike rolling up riders at their expense?
　　At Gotham Bikes in Tribeca, manager W. Ben said the shop has seen an increase in its overall sales due to the bike-share program. “ It’s getting more people on the road,’’ he said. James Ryan, an employee at Danny’s Cycles in Gramercy also said Citi Bike is a good option for people to ease into biking in a city famed for its traffic jams and aggressive drivers. “They can try out a bike without committing to buying one,” he said.
　　Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny’s Cycles. But for Frank’s Bike Shop, a small business on Grand St. , the bike-share program has been bad news. Owner Frank Arroyo said his rental business has decreased by 90% since Citi Bike was rolled out last month. Arroyo’s main rental customers are European tourists, who have since been drawn away by Citi Bikes.
　　However, Ben said the bike-share is good for bike sales at his shop. People have used the bike- share and realized how great it is to bike in the city, then decide that they want something nicer for themselves,’’ he noted.
　　Christian Farrell of Waterfront Bicycle Shop, on West St. just north of Christopher St. , said initially he was concerned about bike-share, though, he admitted, “ I was happy to see people on bikes.”
　　Farrell’s early concerns were echoed by Andrew Crooks, owner of NYC Velo, at 64 Second Ave. “It seemed like a great idea, but one that would be difficult to implement,” Crooks said of Citi Bike. He said he worried about inexperienced riders’ lack of awareness of biking rules and strong negative reaction from non-cyclists. However, he said, ifs still too early to tell if his business has been impacted.
　　While it’s possible bike-share will cause a drop in business, Crooks allowed that the idea is a positive step forward for New York City.
C)What is the author’s chief concern about the increasing use of Citi Bikes in New York?
　　　A) How non-cyclists will respond to it.
　　　B) Whether local bike shops will suffer.
　　　C) Whether local bike businesses will oppose it.
　　　D) How the safety of bike riders can be ensured.
D)What happened to Gotham Bikes as a result of the bike-share program?
　　　A)  It found its bike sales unaffected.	C) It saw its bike sales on the rise.
　　　B)  It shifted its business to rentals.	D) It rented more bikes to tourists.
E)Why is the bike-share program bad news for Franks Bike Shop?
　　　A) It cannot meet the demand of the bike-share program.
　　　B) Its customers have been drawn away by Citi Bikes.
　　　C) Its bike prices have to be lowered again and again.
　　　D) It has to compete with the city’s bike rental shops.
F)Why did Andrew Crooks think that the bike-share program would be difficult to execute?
　　　A)  Inexperienced riders might break biking rules.
　　　B)  Conflicts might arise among bike rental shops.
　　　C)  Traffic conditions might worsen in the downtown area.
　　　D)  There are not enough lanes to accommodate the bikes.
G)What is the general attitude of local bike shops towards Citi Bike?
　　A) Wait-and-see.                    B) Negative.	C) Indifferent.	D) Approving.
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　Various studies have shown that increased spending on education has not led to measurable improvements in learning. Between 1980 and 2008, staff and teachers at US public schools grew roughly twice as fast as students. Yet students showed no additional learning in achievement tests.
　　Universities show similar trends of increased administration personnel and costs without greater learning, as documented in Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa’s recent book Academically Adrift： Limited Learning on College Campuses.
　　A survey shows that 63% of employers say that recent college graduates don’t have the skills they need to succeed and 25% of employers say that entry-level writing skills are lacking.
　　Some simplistically attribute the decline in our public education system to the drain of skilled students by private schools, but far more significant events were at work.
　　Public schools worked well until about the 1970s. In fact, until that time, public schools provided far better education than private ones. It was the underperforming students who were thrown out of public schools and went to private ones.
　　A prominent reason public schools did well was that many highly qualified women had few options for working outside the house other than being teachers or nurses. They accepted relatively low pay, difficult working conditions, and gave their very best.
　　Having such a large supply of talented women teachers meant that society could pay less for their services. Womens liberation opened up new professional opportunities for women, and, over time, some of the best left teaching as a career option, bringing about a gradual decline in the quality of schooling.
　　Also around that time, regulations, government, and unions came to dictate pay, prevent adjustments, and introduce bureaucratic (官僚的）standard for advancement. Large education bureaucracies and unions came to dominate the landscape, confusing activity with achievement. Bureaucrats regularly rewrite curriculums, talk nonsense about theories of education, and require ever more administrators. The end result has been that, after all the spending, students have worse math and reading skills than both their foreign peers and earlier generations spending far less on education— as all the accumulating evidence now documents.
H)What do we learn from various studies on America’s public education?
A)  Achievement tests have failed to truly reflect the quality of teaching.
B)  Public schools lack the resources to compete with private schools.
C)  Little improvement in education has resulted from increased spending.
D)  The number of students has increased much faster than that of teachers.
I)How do some people explain the decline in public education?
A)  Government investment does not meet schools’ needs.
B)  Skilled students are moving to private schools.
C)  Qualified teachers are far from adequately paid.
D)  Training of students, basic skills is neglected.
 63. What was a significant contributor to the past glory of public schools?
A) Well-behaved students.	C) Talented women teachers.
B) Efficient administration.	D) Generous pay for teachers.
E)Why did some of the best women teachers leave teaching?
A)  New career opportunities were made available to them by women’s liberation.
B)  Higher academic requirements made it difficult for them to stay in their jobs.
C)  They were unhappy with the bureaucratic administration in their schools.
D)  The heavy teaching loads left them little time and energy for family life.
F)What does the author think is one of the results of government involvement in education?
A) Increasing emphasis on theories of education.
B)  Highly standardized teaching methods.
C) Students’ improved academic performance.
D) An ever-growing number of administrators.

Section C
Directions： In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.
　　In the center of a big city there are usually dozens of large office buildings that house big banks, corporation headquarters, and government agencies. Thousands of people work in these buildings. People who do all the office work are called white-collar workers.   26   and receptionists, bookkeepers and computer operators work for many different kinds of companies.
　　Many office workers dream of working their way up to the top, from clerk to   27   of a corporation. The way lies through middle management. Middle management includes junior executives, who may fill   28   jobs, supervise other workers in the company,   29   action to top management, or see that the company’s policies are     30    .At the very top are the senior executives. They   31   the policies for their own companies, especially      32	.The Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, of a large     33   has a great deal of power and influence.
　　It is believed that one can start out at the bottom and go all the way to the top. Because financial matters are so important, some accountants become top executives. In companies where technology is important, people with an engineering background can also rise to the top. Nowadays,  however, education    34   in the selection of people for management jobs. Universities in many countries offer courses in business administration. The graduates of these courses often start out in middle management jobs. From there, they can easily get promoted if they show the necessary   35   and ability.

Section A
Directions ： In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
　　For decades, Americans have taken for granted the United States’ leadership position in the development of new technologies. The innovations (创 新）that resulted from research and development during World War Ⅱ and afterwards were    36    to the prosperity of the nation in the second half of the 20th century. Those innovations, upon which virtually all aspects of 37   society now depend, were possible because the United States then   38   the world in mathematics and science education. Today, however, despite increasing demand for workers with strong skills in mathematics and science, the   39   of degrees awarded in science, math, and engineering are decreasing.
　　The decline in degree production in what are called the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and math) seems to be   40   related to the comparatively weak performance by US schoolchildren on international assessments of math and science. Many students entering college have weak skills in mathematics. According to the 2005 report of the Business-Higher Education Forum, 22 percent of college freshmen must take remedial(补习的）math   41  , and less than half of the students who plan to major in science or engineering   42   complete a major in those fields.
　　The result has been a decrease in the number of American college graduates who have the skills,   43    in mathematics, to power a workforce that can keep the country at the forefront（前沿）of innovation and maintain its standard of living. With the 44    performance of American students in math and science has come increased competition from students from other countries that have strongly supported education in these areas. Many more students earn   45   in the STEM disciplines in developing countries than in the United States.


Section B
Directions ： In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Ban Sugary Drinks—That Will Add Fuel to the Obesity War
J)On a train last Thursday, I sat opposite a man who was so fat he filled more than one seat. He was pale and disfigured and looked sick to death, which he probably was: obesity (肥胖症）leads to many nasty ways of dying. Looking around the carriage, I saw quite a few people like him,  including a couple of fatty children with swollen cheeks pressing against their eyes. These people are part of what is without exaggeration an epidemic (流行病) of obesity.
K) But it is quite unnecessary: there is a simple idea—far from new—that could spare millions of such people a lifetime of chronic(长期的）ill health, and at the same time save the National Health Service(NHS) at least￡ 14 billion a year in England and Wales. There would, you might think, be considerable public interest in it. This simple idea is that sugar is as good—or as bad—as poison and should be avoided. It is pure, white and deadly, as Professor John Yudkin described it 40 years ago in a revolutionary book of that name. The subtitle was How Sugar Is Killing Us.
L) In its countless hidden forms, in ready meals, junk food and sweet drinks, sugar leads to addiction (癮）,to hormonal upsets to the appetite, to metabolic (新陈代谢的）malfunctions and obesity and from there to type 2 diabetes (糖尿病) and its many horrible complications. If people really grasped that, they would try to kick the habit, particularly as Britain is the “fat man of Europe”. They might even feel driven to support government measures to prevent people from consuming this deadly stuff. Yet so far this idea has met little but resistance.
M)It is not difficult to imagine the vested interests (既得利益集团）lined up against any sugar control—all the food and drink manufacturers, processors, promoters and retailers who make such easy pickings out of the magic powers of sugar. Then there are the liberals, with whom I would normally side, who protest that government regulation would be yet another instance of interference in our lives.
N)That is true, but people should realise that you cannot have a welfare state without a nanny state (保姆国家）,to some degree. If we are all to be responsible for one another’s health insurance, through socialised medicine, then we are all closely involved in one another^ health, including everyone’s eating and drinking. That has already been admitted, finally, with smoking. But it has yet to be admitted with overeating, even though one in four adults in this country is obese and that number is predicted to double by the year 2050. Quite apart from anything else, obesity will cripple the NHS.
O)Recently, though, there have been signs that the medical establishment is trying to sound the alarm. Last month the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AMRC) published a report saying that obesity is the greatest public health issue affecting the UK and urging government to do something.
P)The report offers 10 recommendations, of which the first is imposing a tax of 20 percent on sugary drinks for at least a year, on top of the existing 20 percent value-added tax. That at least would be an excellent start. The amounts of sugar in soft drinks are horrifying, and turn straight to fat. As Professor Terence Stephenson, head of the AMRC, has said, sugary soft drinks are "the ultimate bad food. You are just consuming neat sugar. Your body didn’t evolve to handle this kind of thing.
Q)Precisely. The risks of eating too much fat or salt (which are very different) pale into insignificance compared with the harm done by sugar. And it is everywhere.
R)It is difficult to buy anything in a supermarket, other than plain, unprepared meat, fish or vegetables, that doesn’t have a large amount of sugar in it. This has come about because the prevailing scientific views of the 1960s and 1970s ignored the evidence about sugar, and instead saw fat as the really serious risk, both to the heart and other organs, as well as the cause of obesity.
S)The fashion was to avoid fat. But finding that food with much of its fat removed is not very appetizing,  food producers turned to sugar as a magic alternative flavour enhancer, often in the forms of syrups （糖浆）that had recently been developed from com, and put it generously into most prepared foods and soft drinks.
T)This stuff is not just fattening. It is addictive. It interferes with the body’s metabolism, possibly via the activity of an appetite-controlling hormone. There’s plenty of evidence for this, for those who will accept the truth.
U)Theoretically, people ought to make” healthy choices” and avoid overeating. But sugar additives are not easy to identify and are hard to avoid. So the snacking, overdrinking and overeating that makes people fat is not really their own fault： obesity is in large part something that is being done to them. It should be stopped,  or rather the government should stop it.
V)Going round my local supermarket, I am constantly astonished that it is still legal to sell all the poisons stacked high on the shelves. The problem is that they are worse than useless. They are poisonous. They are known to be addictive. They are known to make people obese. And giving small children sweet drinks or bottles of fake juice all day long is nothing less than child abuse.
W)Clearly, the sale of such stuff ought to be illegal. I hate to think of yet more government regulation. But a bit of tax on sweet soda and a little more health education, a bit of cooking in schools and banning machines (自动售货机）here and there—as suggested by the AMRC report—is not going to achieve very much. Labelling is quite inadequate. What is needed is legislation banning high levels of sugary syrups used in foods and drinks.
X)In June 2012, the then minister for public health said the government was not scared of the food industry and had not ruled out legislation, because of the costs of obesity to the NHS. However, nothing has happened yet. Why not have another Jammie Dodger biscuit and forget about it.
24.Avoiding over-consumption of sugar can improve peopled health as well as save medical expenses.
25.Laws should be passed to make it illegal to produce overly sweet foods or drinks.
26.Giving small children sweet juices to drink all the time is equal to child abuse.
27.Looking around, the author found obesity quite widespread.
28.The number of obese people is expected to increase quickly in the next few decades.
29.If people really understood the horrible consequences of sugary foods and drinks, they would support government measures against sugar consumption.
30.It would be a very good beginning to impose an additional tax on sugary drinks.
31.The government has not yet taken any action to regulate sugar consumption although it indicated its intention to do so some time ago.
32.Sugar is far more harmful to health than fat and salt.
33.Consumers of sweet foods are not really to blame because they cannot tell what food is sugary.
Section C
Directions： There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
　　　The rise of the Internet has been one of the most transformative developments in human history, comparable in impact to the invention of the printing press and the telegraph. Over two billion people worldwide now have access to vastly more information than ever before, and can communicate with each other instantly, often using Web-connected mobile devices they carry everywhere. But the Internets tremendous impact has only just begun.
　　　“Mass adoption of the Internet is driving one of the most exciting social, cultural, and political transformations in history, and unlike earlier periods of change, this time the effects are fully global, ” Schmidt and Cohen write in their new book, The New Digital Age.
　　　Perhaps the most profound changes will come when the five billion people worldwide who currently lack Internet access get online. The authors do an excellent job of examining the implications of the Internet revolution for individuals, governments, and institutions like the news media. But if the book has one major shortcoming, it’s that the authors don’t spend enough time applying a critical eye to the role of Internet businesses in these sweeping changes.
　　　In their book, the authors provide the most authoritative volume to date that describes—and more importantly predicts—how the Internet will shape our lives in the coming decades. They paint a picture of a world in which individuals, companies, institutions, and governments must deal with two realities, one physical, and one virtual.
　　At the core of the book is the idea that “technology is neutral, but people aren’t.’’ By using this concept as a starting point, the authors aim to move beyond the now familiar optimist vs. pessimist dichotomy (对立观点) that has characterized many recent debates about whether the rise of the Internet will ultimately be good or bad for society. In an interview with TIME earlier this week, Cohen said although he and his co-author are optimistic about many aspects of the Internet, they’ve also realistic about the risks and dangers that lie ahead when the next five billion people come online, particularly with respect to personal privacy and state surveillance (监视).
34.In what way is the rise of the Internet similar to the invention of the printing press and the telegraph?
　　E)It transforms human history.	C)	It is adopted by all humanity.
　　F)It facilitates daily communication.	D)	It revolutionizes people’s thinking.
35.How do Schmidt and Cohen describe the effects of the Internet?
　　G)They are immeasurable.	C)	They are unpredictable.
　　H)They are worldwide.	D)	They are contaminating.
36.In what respect is the book The New Digital Age considered inadequate?
　　H)It fails to recognize the impact of the Internet technology.
　　I)It fails to look into the social implications of the Internet.
　　J)It lacks an objective evaluation of the role of Internet businesses.
　　K)It does not address the technical aspects of Internet communication.
37.What will the future be like when everybody gets online?
　　S)People will be living in two different realities.
　　T)People will have equal access to information.
　　U)People don’t have to travel to see the world.
　　V)People don^ have to communicate face to face.
38.What does the passage say about the authors of The New Digital Age?
　　78.They leave many questions unanswered concerning the Internet.
　　79.They are optimistic about the future of the Internet revolution.
　　80.They have explored the unknown territories of the virtual world.
　　81.They don^ take sides in analyzing the effects of the Internet.
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
　　In 1950, a young man would have found it much easier than it is today to get and keep a job in the auto industry. And in that year the average autoworker could meet monthly mortgage（抵押贷款） payments on an average home with just 13. 4 percent of his take-home pay. Today a similar mortgage would claim more than twice that share of his monthly earnings.
　　Other members of the autoworker’s family, however, might be less inclined to trade the present for the past. His retired parents would certainly have had less economic security back then. Throughout much of the 1960s, more than a quarter of men and women age 65 and older lived below the poverty level, compared to less than 10 percent in 2010.
　　In most states, his wife could not have taken out a loan or a credit card in her own name. In 42 states, a homemaker had no legal claim on the earnings of her husband. And nowhere did a wife have legal protection against family violence.
　　Most black workers would not want to return to a time when, on average, they earned 40 percent less than their white counterparts (职位相当的人）,while racially restrictive agreements largely prevented them from buying into the suburban neighborhoods being built for white working-class families.
　　Today, new problems have emerged in the process of resolving old ones, but the solution is not to go back to the past. Some people may long for an era when divorce was still hard to come by. The spread of no-fault divorce has reduced the bargaining power of whichever spouse is more interested in continuing the relationship. And the breakup of such marriages has caused pain for many families.
　　The growing diversity of family life comes with new possibilities as well as new challenges. According to a recent poll, more than 80 percent of Americans believe that their current family is as close as the one in which they grew up, or closer. Finding ways to improve the lives of the remaining 20 percent seems more realistic than trying to restore an imaginary golden age.
39.What do we learn about American autoworkers in 1950?
　　O)They had less job security than they do today.
　　P)It was not too difficult for them to buy a house.
　　Q)Their earnings were worth twice as much as today.
　　R)They were better off than workers in other industries.
40.What does the author say about retired people today?
　　J)They invariably long to return to the golden past.
　　K)They do not depend so much on social welfare.
　　L)They feel more secure economically than in the past.
　　M)They are usually unwilling to live with their children.
41.Why couldn’t black workers buy a house in a white suburban neighborhood?
　　　A)  They lacked the means of transportation.	C) They were afraid to break the law.
　　　B)  They were subjected to racial inequality.	D) They were too poor to afford it.
42.What is the result of no-fault divorce?
　　　A)  Divorce is easier to obtain.	C) It causes little pain to either side.
　　　B)  Domestic violence is lessened.	D) It contributes to social unrest.
43.What does the author suggest society do?
　　A)Get prepared to face any new challenges.
　　B)Try to better the current social security net.
　　C)Narrow the gap between blacks and whites.
　　D)Improve the lives of families with problems.

Question 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.

　　As a teacher, you could bring the community into your classroom in many ways. The parents and grandparents of your students are resources and     36      for their children. They can be      37      teachers of their own traditions and histories. Immigrant parents could talk about their country of   38    and why they emigrated to the United States. Parents can be invited to talk about their jobs or a community project. Parents, of course, are not the only community resources. Employees at local businesses and staff at community agencies have 39 information to share in classrooms.
　　Field trips provide another opportunity to know the community. Many students don’t have the opportunity to     40      concerts or visit museums or historical sites except through field trips. A school district should have      41      for selecting and conducting field trips. Families must be made   42    of field trips and give permission for their children to participate.
　　Through school projects, students can learn to be   43    in community projects ranging from planting trees to cleaning up a park to assisting elderly people. Students, 44 older ones, might conduct research on a community need that could lead to action by a city council or state government. Some schools require students to provide community

service by   45    in a nursing home, child care center or government agency. These projects help students understand their responsibility to the larger community.

Reaping the Rewards of Risk-Taking

A)Since Steve Jobs resigned as chief executive of Apple, much has been said about him as a peerless business leader who has created immense wealth for shareholders, and guided the design of hit products that are transforming entire industries, like music and mobile communications.
B)All true, but let’s think different, to borrow the Apple marketing slogan of years back. Let’s look at Mr. Jobs as a role model.
C)Above all, he is an innovator (创新者）. His creative force is seen in products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, and in new business models for pricing and distributing music and mobile software online. Studies of innovation come to the same conclusion: you can’t engineer innovation, but you can increase the odds of it occurring. And Mr. Jobs’ career can be viewed as a consistent pursuit of improving those odds, both for himself and the companies he has led. Mr. Jobs, of course, has enjoyed singular success. But innovation, broadly defined, is the crucial ingredient in all economic progress—higher growth for nations, more competitive products for companies, and more prosperous careers for individuals. And Mr. Jobs, many experts say, exemplifies what works in the innovation game.
D)“We can look at and learn from Steve Jobs what the essence of American innovation is,” says John Kao, an innovation consultant to corporations and governments. Many other nations, Mr. John Kao notes, are now ahead of the United States in producing

what are considered the raw materials of innovation. These include government financing for scientific research, national policies to support emerging industries, educational achievement, engineers and scientists graduated, even the speeds of Internet broadband service.”
E)Yet what other nations typically lack, Mr. Kao adds, is a social environment that encourages diversity, experimentation, risk-taking, and combining skills from many fields into products that he calls “recombinant mash-ups ( 打碎重组),” like the iPhone, which redefined the smartphone category. “The culture of other countries doesn’t support the kind of innovation that Steve Jobs exemplifies, as America does,” Mr. John Kao says.
F)Workers of every rank are told these days that wide-ranging curiosity and continuous learning are vital to thriving in the modem economy. Formal education matters, career counselors say, but real- life experience is often even more valuable.
G)An adopted child, growing up in Silicon Valley, Mr. Jobs displayed those traits early on. He was fascinated by electronics as a child, building Heath kit do-it-yourself projects, like radios. Mr. Jobs dropped out of Reed College after only a semester and traveled around India in search of spiritual enlightenment, before returning to Silicon Valley to found Apple with his friend, Stephen Wozniak, an engineering wizard (奇才). Mr. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, went off and founded two other companies, Next and Pixar, before returning to Apple in 1996 and becoming chief executive in 1997.
H)His path was unique, but innovation experts say the pattern of exploration is not unusual. “It’s often people like Steve Jobs who can draw from a deep reservoir of diverse experiences that often generate breakthrough ideas and insights,” says Hal Gregersen, a professor at the European Institute of Business Administration.
I)Mr. Gregersen is a co-author of a new book, The Innovator’s DNA, which is based on an eight-year study of 5000 ( 创 业 者 ） and executives worldwide. His two collaborators and co-authors are Jeff Dyer, a professor at Brigham Young University, and Clayton Christensen, a professor at the Harvard Business School, whose 1997 book The Innovators Dilemma popularized the concept of disruptive ( 颠覆性的） innovation.”
J)The academics identify five traits that are common to the disruptive innovators: questioning, experimenting, observing, associating and networking. Their bundle of characteristics echoes the ceaseless curiosity and willingness to take risks noted by other experts. Networking, Mr. Hal Gregersen explains, is less about career-building relationships than a consistent search for new ideas. Associating, he adds, is the ability to make idea-producing connections by linking concepts from different disciplines.

K)“Innovators engage in these mental activities regularly,” Mr. Gregersen says. “It’s a habit for them Innovative companies, according to the authors, typically enjoy higher valuations in the stock market, which they call an “innovation premium (溢价）.” It is calculated by estimating the share of a company’s value that cannot be accounted for by its current products and cash flow. The innovation premium tries to quantify (量化) investors’ bets that a company will do even better in the future because of innovation.


L)Apple, by their calculations, had a 37 percent innovation premium during Mr. Jobs’ first term with the company. His years in exile resulted in a 31 percent innovation discount. After his return, Applet fortunes improved gradually at first, and improved markedly starting in 2005, yielding a 52 percent innovation premium since then.
M)	There is no conclusive proof, but Mr. Hal Gregersen says it is unlikely that Mr. Jobs could have reshaped industries beyond computing, as he has done in his second term at Apple, without the experience outside the company, especially at Pixar—the computer-animation ( 动 画 制 作 ） studio that created a string of critically and commercially successful movies, such as “Toy Story” and “Up.”
N)Mr. Jobs suggested much the same thing during a commencement address to the graduating class at Stanford University in 2005. “It turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me,” he told the students. Mr. Jobs also spoke of perseverance (坚持）and will power. “Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick,” he said. “Don’t lose faith. ”Mark D. Shermis, a professor at the University of Akron in Ohio, supervised the Hewlett Foundation’s contest on automated essay scoring and wrote a paper about the experiment. In his view, the technology—though imperfect—has a place in educational settings.
O)Mr. Jobs ended his commencement talk with a call to innovation, both in one’s choice of work and in one’s life. Be curious, experiment, take risks, he said to the students. His advice was emphasized by the words on the back of the final edition of The Whole Earth Catalog, which he quoted “Stay hungry. Stay foolish. ” And, Mr. Jobs said, “I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.
P)Often they come from very famous institutions where, in fact, they do a much better job of providing feedback than a machine ever could,” Dr. Shermis said. “There seems to be a lack of appreciation of what is actually going on in the real world.”
36.Steve Jobs called on Stanford graduates to innovate in his commencement address.

37.Steve Jobs considered himself lucky to have been fired once by Apple.

38.Steve Jobs once used computers to make movies that were commercial hits.

39.Many governments have done more than the US government in providing the raw materials for innovation.
40.Great innovators are good at connecting concepts from various academic fields.

41.Innovation is vital to driving economic progress.

42.America has a social environment that is particularly favorable to innovation.

43.Innovative ideas often come from diverse experiences.

44.Real-life experience is often more important than formal education for career success.

45.Applet fortunes suffered from an innovation discount during Jobs’ absence.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B),
C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on
Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　Some of the world’s most significant problems never hit headlines. One example comes from agriculture. Food riots and hunger make news. But the trend lying behind these matters is rarely talked about. This is the decline in the growth in yields of some of the world’s major crops. A new study by the University of Minnesota and McGill University in Montreal looks at where, and how far, this decline is occurring.
　　The authors take a vast number of data points for the four most important crops: rice, wheat, com and soybeans ( 大豆). They find that on between 24% and 39% of all harvested areas, the improvement in yields that took place before the 1980s slowed down in the 1990s and 2000s.
　　There are two worrying features of the slowdown. One is that it has been particularly sharp in the world’s most (人口多的）countries, India and China. Their ability to feed themselves has been an important source of relative stability both within the countries and on world food markets. That self-sufficiency cannot be taken for granted if yields continue to slow down or reverse.
　　Second, yield growth has been lower in wheat and rice than in com and soybeans. This is problematic because wheat and rice are more important as foods, accounting for around half of all calories consumed. Corn and soybeans are more important as feed grains. The authors note that “we have preferentially focused our crop improvement efforts on feeding animals and cars rather than on crops that feed people and are the basis

of food security in much of the world.”

　　The report qualifies the more optimistic findings of another new paper which suggests that the world will not have to dig up a lot more land for farming in order to feed 9 billion people in 2050, as the Food and Agriculture Organisation has argued.
　　Instead, it says, thanks to slowing population growth, land currently ploughed up for crops might be able to revert ( 回返） to forest or wilderness. This could happen. The trouble is that the forecast assumes continued improvements in yields, which may not actually happen.
46.What does the author try to draw attention to?
A)Food riots and hunger in the world.	C) The decline of the grain yield growth.
B)News headlines in the leading media.	D) The food supply in populous countries.

47.Why does the author mention India and China in particular?
A)Their self-sufficiency is vital to the stability of world food markets.
B)Their food yields have begun to decrease sharply in recent years.
C)Their big populations are causing worldwide concerns.
D)Their food self-sufficiency has been taken for granted.

48.What does the new study by the two universities say about recent crop improvement efforts?
A)They fail to produce the same remarkable results as before the 1980s.
B)They contribute a lot to the improvement of human food production.
C)They play a major role in guaranteeing the food security of the world.
D)They focus more on the increase of animal feed than human food grains.

49.What does the Food and Agriculture Organisation say about world food production in the coming decades?
A)The growing population will greatly increase the pressure on world food supplies.
B)The optimistic prediction about food production should be viewed with caution.
C)The slowdown of the growth in yields of major food crops will be reversed.
D)The world will be able to feed its population without increasing farmland.

50.How does the author view the argument of the Food and Agriculture Organisation?
A)It is built on the findings of a new study.
B)It is based on a doubtful assumption.
C)It is backed by strong evidence.
D)It is open to further discussion.


Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　The endless debate about “work-life balance” often contains a hopeful footnote about stay-at-home dads. If American society and business won’t make it easier on future female leaders who choose to have children, there is still the ray of hope that increasing numbers of full-time fathers will. But based on today’s socioeconomic trends, this hope is, unfortunately, misguided.
　　It’s true that the number of men who have left work to do their thing as full-time parents has doubled in a decade, but it’s still very small: only 0. 8% of married couples where the stay-at-home father was out of the labor force for a year. Even that percentage is likely inflated by men thrust into their caretaker role by a downsizing. This is simply not a large enough group to reduce the social stigma (污名) and force other adjustments necessary to supporting men in this decision, even if only for a relatively short time.
　　Even shorter times away from work for working fathers are already difficult. A study found that 85% of new fathers take some time off after the birth of a child—but for all but a few, it’s a week or two at most. Meanwhile, the average for women who take leave is more than 10 weeks.
　　Such choices impact who moves up in the organization. While you’re away, someone else is doing your work, making your sales, taking care of your customers. That can’t help you at work. It can only hurt you. Women, of course, face the same issues of returning after a long absence. But with many more women than men choosing to leave the workforce entirely to raise families, returning from an extended parental leave doesn’t raise as many eyebrows as it does for men.
　　Women would make more if they didn’t break their earning trajectory ( 轨迹） by leaving the workforce, or if higher-paying professions were more family-friendly. In the foreseeable future, stay-at-home fathers may make all the difference for individual families, but their presence won’t reduce the numbers of high-potential women who are forced to choose between family and career.


51.What gives women a ray of hope to achieve work-life balance?
A)More men taking an extended parental leave.
B)Peopled changing attitudes towards family.
C)More women entering business management.
D)The improvement of their socioeconomic status.

52.Why does the author say the hope for more full-time fathers is misguided?
A)Women are better at taking care of children.
B)Many men value work more than their family.
C)Their number is too small to make a difference.
D)Not many men have the chance to stay at home.

53.Why do few men take a long parental leave?
A)A long leave will have a negative impact on their career.
B)They just have too many responsibilities to fulfill at work.
C)The economic loss will be too much for their family to bear.
D)They are likely to get fired if absent from work for too long.

54.What is the most likely reaction to men returning from an extended parental leave?
A) Jealousy.	B)	Surprise.	C) Admiration.	D) Sympathy.

55.What does the author say about high-potential women in the not-too-distant future?
A)They will benefit from the trend of more fathers staying at home.
B)They will find high-paying professions a bit more family-friendly.
C)They are unlikely to break their career trajectory to raise a family.
D)They will still face the difficult choice between career and children.

Question 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　It’s our guilty pleasure: Watching TV is the most common everyday activity, after work and sleep, in many parts of the world. Americans view five hours of TV each day, and while we know that spending so much time sitting   26    can lead to obesity（肥胖症）and other diseases, researchers have now quantified just how 27 being a couch potato can be.
　　In an analysis of data from eight large      28      published studies, a Harvard-led group reported in the that for every two hours per day spent channel 29 , the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes Journal of the American Medical Association (糖尿病）rose 20% over 8.5 years, the risk of heart disease increased 15% over a      30    , and the odds of dying prematurely      31       13% during a seven-year follow-up. All of these       32 are linked to a lack of physical exercise. But compared with other sedentary (久坐的） activities, like knitting, viewing TV may be especially 33 at promoting unhealthy

habits. For one, the sheer number of hours we pass watching TV dwarfs the time we spend on anything else. And other studies have found that watching ads for beer and popcorn may make you more likely to 34 them.
　　Even so, the authors admit that they didn’t compare different sedentary activities to   35   whether TV watching was linked to a greater risk of diabetes, heart disease or early death compared with, say, reading.

The Changes Facing Fast Food

A)Fast-food firms have to be a thick-skinned bunch. Health experts regularly criticise them severely for selling food that makes people fat. Critics even complain that McDonald’s, whose logo symbolises calorie excess, should not have been allowed to sponsor the World Cup. These are things fast-food firms have learnt to cope with. But not perhaps for much longer. The burger business faces more pressure from regulators at a time when it is already adapting strategies in response to shifts in the global economy.
B)Fast food was once thought to be recession-proof. When consumers need to cut spending, the logic goes, cheap meals like Big Macs and Whoppers become even more attractive. Such “trading down” proved true for much of the latest recession, when fast-food companies picked up customers who could no longer afford to eat at casual restaurants. Traffic was boosted in America, the home of fast food, with discounts and promotions, such as $ 1 menus and cheap combination meals.
C)As a result, fast-food chains have weathered the recession better than their more expensive competitors. In 2009 sales at full-service restaurants in America fell by

more than 6%, but total sales remained about the same at fast-food chains. In some markets, such as Japan, France and Britain, total spending on fast food increased. Same-store sales in America at McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast-food company, did not decline throughout the downturn. Panera Bread, an American fast-food chain known for its fresh ingredients, performed well, too, because it offers higher-quality food at lower prices than restaurants.
D)But not all fast-food companies have been as fortunate. Many, such as Burger King, have seen sales fall. In a severe recession, while some people trade down to fast food, many others eat at home more frequently to save money. David Palmer, an analyst at UBS, a bank, says smaller fast-food chains in America, such as Jack in the Box and Carl’s Jr., have been hit particularly hard in this downturn because they are competing with the global giant McDonald, which increased spending on advertising by more than 7% last year as others cut back.
E)Some fast-food companies also sacrificed their own profits by trying to give customers better value. During the recession companies set prices low, hoping that once they had tempted customers through the door they would be persuaded to order more expensive items. But in many cases that strategy did not work. Last year Burger franchisees（特许经营人）sued（起诉） the company over its double-cheeseburger promotion, claiming it was unfair for them to be required to sell these for $ 1 when they cost $ 1.10 to make. In May a judge ruled in favour of Burger King. Nevertheless, the company may still be cursing its decision to promote cheap choices over more expensive ones because items on its “value menu” now account for around 20% of all sales, up from 12% last October.
F)Analysts expect the fast-food industry to grow modestly this year. But the downturn is making companies rethink their strategies. Many are now introducing higher-priced items to entice （引诱） consumers away from $ 1 specials. RFC, a division of Yum! Brands, which also owns Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, has launched a chicken sandwich that costs around $ 5. And in May Burger King introduced barbecue（烧烤）pork ribs at $ 7 for eight.
G)Companies are also trying to get customers to buy new and more items, including drinks. McDonald’s started selling better coffee as a challenge to Starbucks. Its “McCafe” line now accounts for an estimated 6% of sales in America. Starbucks has sold rights to its Seattle’s Best coffee brand to Burger King, which will start selling it later this year.
H)As fast-food companies shift from “super-size” to “more buys”, they need to keep customer traffic high throughout the day. Many see breakfast as a big opportunity, and not just for fatty food. McDonald’s will start selling porridge（粥）in America next year. Breakfast has the potential to be very profitable, says Sara Senatore of Bernstein,

a research firm, because the margins can be high. Fast-food companies are also adding midday and late-night snacks, such as blended drinks and wraps. The idea is that by having a greater range of things on the menu, “we can sell to consumers products they want all day,” says Rick Carucci, the chief financial officer of Yum! Brands.
I)But what about those growing waistlines? So far, fast-food firms have cleverly avoided government regulation. By providing healthy options, like salads and low-calorie sandwiches, they have at least given the impression of doing something about helping to fight obesity ( 肥胖症）. These offerings are not necessarily loss-leaders, as they broaden the appeal of outlets to groups of diners that include some people who don’t want to eat a burger. But customers cannot be forced to order salads instead of fries.
J)In the future, simply offering a healthy option may not be good enough. “Every packaged-food and restaurant company I know is concerned about regulation right now,” says Mr. Palmer of UBS. America’s health-reform bill, which Congress passed this year, requires restaurant chains with 20 or more outlets to put the calorie-content of items they serve on the menu. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which tracked the effects on Starbucks of a similar calorie-posting law in New York City in 2007, found that the average calorie-count per transaction fell 6% and revenue increased 3% at Starbucks stores where a Dunkin Donuts outlet was nearby—a sign, it is said, that menu-labelling could favour chains that have more healthy offerings.
K)In order to avoid other legislation in America and elsewhere, fast-food companies will have to continue innovating ( 创新). Walt Riker of McDonald’s claims the change it has made in its menu means it offers more healthy items than it did a few years ago. “We probably sell more vegetables, more milk, more salads, more apples than any restaurant business in the world,” he says. But the recent proposal by a county in California to ban McDonald’s from including toys in its high-calorie “Happy Meals”, because legislators believe it attracts children to unhealthy food, suggests there is a lot more left to do.
36.Some people propose laws be made to stop McDonald’s from attaching toys to its food specials for children.
37.Fast-food firms may not be able to cope with pressures from food regulation in the near future.
38.Burger King will start to sell Seattle’s Best coffee to increase sales.

39.Some fast-food firms provide healthy food to give the impression they are helping to tackle the obesity problem.
40.During the recession, many customers turned to fast food to save money.

41.Many people eat out less often to save money in times of recession.

42.During the recession, Burger King’s promotional strategy of offering low-priced items often proved ineffective.
43.Fast-food restaurants can make a lot of money by selling breakfast.

44.	Many fast-food companies now expect to increase their revenue by introducing higher-priced items.
45.A newly-passed law asks big fast-food chains to specify the calorie count of what they serve on the menu.


Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B),
C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on
Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　If you think a high-factor sunscreen (防晒霜) keeps you safe from harmful rays, you may be wrong. Research in this week Nature shows that while factor 50 reduces the number of melanomas ( 黑 瘤 ） and delays their occurrence, it can’t prevent them. Melanomas are the most aggressive skin cancers. You have a higher risk if you have red or blond hair, fair skin, blue or green eyes, or sunburn easily, or if a close relative has had one. Melanomas are more common if you have periodic intense exposure to the sun. Other skin cancers are increasingly likely with long-term exposure.
　　There is continuing debate as to how effective sunscreen is in reducing melanomas—the evidence is weaker than it is for preventing other types of skin cancer. A 2011 Australian study of 1,621 people found that people randomly selected to apply sunscreen daily had half the rate of melanomas of people who used cream as needed. A second study, comparing 1,167 people with melanomas to 1,101 who didn’t have the cancer, found that using sunscreen routinely, alongside other protection such as hats, long sleeves or staying in the shade, did give some protection. This study said other forms of sun protection—not sunscreen—seemed most beneficial. The study relied on people remembering what they had done over each decade of their lives, so it’s not entirely reliable. But it seems reasonable to think sunscreen gives people a false sense of security in the sun.
　　Many people also don’t use sunscreen properly—applying insufficient amounts, failing to reapply after a couple of hours and staying in the sun too long. It is sunburn that

is most worrying—recent research shows five episodes of sunburn in the teenage years increases the risk of all skin cancers.
　　The good news is that a combination of sunscreen and covering up can reduce melanoma rates, as shown by Australian figures from their slip-slop-slap campaign. So if there is a heat wave this summer, it would be best for us, too, to slip on a shirt, slop on (补上) sunscreen and slap on a hat.
46.What is peopled common expectation of a high-factor sunscreen?
A)It will delay the occurrence of skin cancer.
B)It will protect them from sunburn.
C)It will keep their skin smooth and fair.
D)It will work for people of any skin color.

47.What does the research in Nature say about a high-factor sunscreen?
A)It is ineffective in preventing melanomas.
B)It is ineffective in case of intense sunlight.
C)It is ineffective with long-term exposure.
D)It is ineffective for people with fair skin.

48.What do we learn from the 2011 Australian study of 1, 621 people?
A)Sunscreen should be applied alongside other protection measures.
B)High-risk people benefit the most from the application of sunscreen.
C)Irregular application of sunscreen does women more harm than good.
D)Daily application of sunscreen helps reduce the incidence of melanomas.

49.What does the author say about the second Australian study?
A)It misleads people to rely on sunscreen for protection.
B)It helps people to select the most effective sunscreen.
C)It is not based on direct observation of the subjects.
D)It confirms the results of the first Australian study.

50.What does the author suggest to reduce melanoma rates?
A)Using both covering up and sunscreen.
B)Staying in the shade whenever possible.
C)Using covering up instead of sunscreen.
D)Applying the right amount of sunscreen.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

Across the rich world, well-educated people increasingly work longer than the

less-skilled. Some 65% of American men aged 62-74 with a professional degree are in the workforce, compared with 32% of men with only a high-school certificate. This gap is part of a deepening divide between the well-educated well-off and the unskilled poor. Rapid technological advance has raised the incomes of the highly skilled while squeezing those of the unskilled. The consequences, for individuals and society, are profound.
　　The world is facing an astonishing rise in the number of old people, and they will live longer than ever before. Over the next 20 years the global population of those aged 65 or more will almost double, from 600 million to 1. 1 billion. The experience of the 20th century, when greater longevity (长寿）translated into more years in retirement rather than more years at work, has persuaded many observers that this shift will lead to slower economic growth, while the swelling ranks of pensioners will create government budget problems.
　　But the notion of a sharp division between the working young and the idle old misses a new trend, the growing gap between the skilled and the unskilled. Employment rates are falling among younger unskilled people, whereas older skilled folk are working longer. The divide is most extreme in America, where well-educated baby-boomers (二战后生育高峰期出生的美国人）are putting off retirement while many less-skilled younger people have dropped out of the workforce.
　　Policy is partly responsible. Many European governments have abandoned policies that used to encourage people to retire early. Rising life expectancy ( 预 期 寿 命 ), combined with the replacement of generous defined-benefit pension plans with less generous defined-contribution ones, means that even the better-off must work longer to have a comfortable retirement. But the changing nature of work also plays a big role. Pay has risen sharply for the highly educated, and those people continue to reap rich rewards into old age because these days the educated elderly are more productive than the preceding generation. Technological change may well reinforce that shift: the skills that complement computers, from management know-how to creativity, do not necessarily decline with age.

A)Younger people are replacing the elderly.
B)Well-educated people tend to work longer.
C)Unemployment rates are rising year after year.
D)People with no college degree do not easily find work.

52.What has helped deepen the divide between the well-off and the poor?
A)Longer life expectancies.
B)A rapid technological advance.
C)Profound changes in the workforce.

D)A growing number of the well-educated.

53.What do many observers predict in view of the experience of the 20th century?
A)Economic growth will slow down.
B)Government budgets will increase.
C)More people will try to pursue higher education.
D)There will be more competition in the job market.

54.What is the result of policy changes in European countries?
A)Unskilled workers may choose to retire early.
B)More people have to receive in-service training.
C)Even wealthy people must work longer to live comfortably in retirement.
D)People may be able to enjoy generous defined-benefits from pension plans.

55.What is characteristic of work in the 21st century?
A)Computers will do more complicated work.
B)More will be taken by the educated young.
C)Most jobs to be done will be the creative ones.
D)Skills are highly valued regardless of age.

　　The U. S. Department of Education is making efforts to ensure that all students have equal access to a quality education.

　　“All children are      27      to a high-quality education regardless of their race, zip code or family income. It is       28       important that we provide teachers and principals the support they need to help students reach their full    29     ” U. S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said. “Despite the excellent work and deep     30      of our nation’s teachers and principals, students in high-poverty, high-minority schools are unfairly treated across our country. We have to do better. Local leaders and educators will
31      their own creative solutions, but we must work together to      32      our focus on how to better recruit, support and      33      effective teachers and principals for all students, especially the kids who need them most.”
　　Today’s announcement is another important step forward in improving access to a quality education, a 34 of President Obama’s year of action.

Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Essay-Grading Software Offers Professors a Break

A)Imagine taking a college exam, and, instead of handing in a blue book and getting a grade from a professor a few weeks later, clicking the “send” button when you are

done and receiving a grade back instantly, your essay scored by a software program. And then, instead of being done with that exam, imagine that the system would immediately let you rewrite the test to try to improve your grade.
B)EdX, the nonprofit enterprise founded by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to offer courses on the Internet, has just introduced such a system and will make its automated ( 自动的） software available free on the Web to any institution that wants to use it. The software uses artificial intelligence to grade student essays and short written answers, freeing professors for other tasks.
C)The new service will bring the educational consortium (联盟) into a growing conflict over the role of automation in education. Although automated grading systems for multiple-choice and true-false tests are now widespread, the use of artificial intelligence technology to grade essay answers has not yet received widespread acceptance by educators and has many critics.
D)Anant Agarwal, an electrical engineer who is president of EdX, predicted that the instant-grading software would be a useful teaching tool, enabling students to take tests and write essays over and over and improve the quality of their answers. He said the technology would offer distinct advantages over the traditional classroom system, where students often wait days or weeks for grades. “There is a huge value in learning with instant feedback,” Dr. Agarwal said. “Students are telling us they learn much better with instant feedback.”
E)But skeptics ( 怀疑者) the automated system is no match for live teachers. One longtime critic , Les Perelman, has drawn national attention several times for putting together nonsense essays that have fooled software grading programs into giving high marks. He has also been highly critical of studies claiming that the software compares well to human graders.
F)He is among a group of educators who last month began circulating a petition (呼吁) opposing automated assessment software. The group, which calls itself Professionals Against Machine Scoring of Student Essays in High-Stakes Assessment, has collected nearly 2,000 signatures, including some from famous people like Noam Chomsky.
G)“Let’s face the realities of automatic essay scoring,” the group’s statement reads in part. “Computers cannot ‘read’. They cannot measure the essentials of effective written communication: accuracy, reasoning, adequacy of evidence, good sense, ethical (伦理的) position, convincing argument, meaningful organization, and clarity, among others.
H)But EdX expects its software to be adopted widely by schools and universities. It offers free online classes from Harvard, MIT and the University of California-Berkeley; this fall, it will add classes from Wellesley, Georgetown and the

University of Texas. In all, 12 universities participate in EdX, which offers certificates for course completion and has said that it plans to continue to expand next year, including adding international schools.
I)The EdX assessment tool requires human teachers, or graders, to first grade 100 essays or essay questions. The system then uses a variety of machine-learning techniques to train itself to be able to grade any number of essays or answers automatically and almost instantly. The software will assign a grade depending on the scoring system created by the teacher, whether it is a letter grade or numerical（数字的）rank.
J)EdX is not the first to use the automated assessment technology, which dates to early computers in the 1960s. There is now a range of companies offering commercial programs to grade written test answers, and four states—Louisiana, North Dakota, Utah and West Virginia—are using some form of the technology in secondary schools. A fifth, Indiana, has experimented with it. In some cases the software is used as a “second reader,” to check the reliability of the human graders.
K)But the growing influence of the EdX consortium to set standards is likely to give the technology a boost. On Tuesday, Stanford announced that it would work with EdX to develop a joint educational system that will make use of the automated assessment technology.
L)Two start-ups, Coursera and Udacity, recently founded by Stanford faculty members to create “massive open online courses,” or MOOCs, are also committed to automated assessment systems because of the value of instant feedback. “It allows students to get immediate feedback on their work, so that lean turns into a game, with students naturally ( 吸引) toward resubmitting the work until they get it right,” said Daphne Roller, a computer scientist and a founder of Coursera.
M)	Last year the Hewlett Foundation, a grant-making organization set up by one of the Hewlett-Packard founders and his wife, sponsored two $100,000 prizes aimed at improving software that grades essays and short answers. More than 150 teams entered each category. A winner of one of the Hewlett contests, Vik Paruchuri, was hired by EdX to help design its assessment software.
N)“One of our focuses is to help kids learn how to think critically,” said Victor Vuchic, a program officer at the Hewlett Foundation. “It’s probably impossible to do that with multiple-choice tests. The challenge is that this requires human graders, and so they cost a lot more and they take a lot more time.”
O)Mark D. Shermis, a professor at the University of Akron in Ohio, supervised the Hewlett Foundation’s contest on automated essay scoring and wrote a paper about the experiment. In his view, the technology—though imperfect—has a place in educational settings.

P)With increasingly large classes, it is impossible for most teachers to give students meaningful feedback on writing assignments, he said. Plus, he noted, critics of the technology have tended to come from the nation’s best universities, where the level of teaching is much better than at most schools.
Q)Often they come from very famous institutions where, in fact, they do a much better job of providing feedback than a machine ever could,” Dr. Shermis said. “There seems to be a lack of appreciation of what is actually going on in the real world.”
36.Some professionals in education are collecting signatures to voice their opposition to automated essay grading.
37.Using software to grade students’ essays saves teachers time for other work.

38.The Hewlett contests aim at improving essay grading software.

39.Though the automated grading system is widely used in multiple-choice tests, automated essay grading is still criticized by many educators.
40.Some people don’t believe the software grading system can do as good a job as human graders.
41.Critics of automated essay scoring do not seem to know the true realities in less famous universities.
42.Critics argue many important aspects of effective writing cannot be measured by computer rating programs.
43.As class size grows, most teachers are unable to give students valuable comments as to how to improve their writing.
44.The automated assessment technology is sometimes used to double check the work of human graders.
45.Students find instant feedback helps improve their learning considerably.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B),
C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on
Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　Boys' schools are the perfect place to teach young men to express their emotions and involve them in activities such as art, dance and music.

　　Far from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity( 阳刚), the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to conform to a stereotype, a US study says.
　　Boys at single-sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their emotional expressiveness, rather than feeling they had to conform to the “boy code” of hiding their emotions to be a "real man".
　　The findings of the study go against received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls.
　　Tony Little, headmaster of Eton, warned that boys were being failed by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls. He criticised teachers for failing to recognise that boys are actually more emotional than girls.
　　The research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their female peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills.
　　But in single-sex schools teachers can tailor lessons to boys' learning style, letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom, wrote the study's author, Abigail James, of the University of Virginia.
　　Teachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with “boy-focused” approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them.Because boys generally have more acute vision, learn best through touch, and are physically more active, they need to be given“hands-on”lessons where they are allowed to walk around. “Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine(女性的) and prefer the modern genre(类型) in which violence and sexism are major themes,”James wrote.
　　Single-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to conform to a stereotype that men should be “masterful and in charge”in relationships. “In mixed schools, boys feel compelled to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means,” the study reported.
46.The author believes that a single-sex school would	. A ) force boys to hide their emotions to be “real men”
B)help to cultivate masculine aggressiveness in boys
C)encourage boys to express their emotions more freely
D)naturally reinforce in boys the traditional image of a man

47.It is commonly believed that in a mixed school boys	.
A) perform relatively better
C)behave more responsibly B ) grow up more healthily
D)receive a better education

48.What does Tony Little say about the British education system?
A) It fails more boys than girls academically.
C) It fails to give boys the attention they need.
B) It focuses more on mixed school education.
D) It places more pressure on boys than on girls.
49.According to Abigail James, one of the advantages of single-sex schools is	.
A)teaching can be tailored to suit the characteristics of boys
B)boys can focus on their lessons without being distracted
C)boys can choose to learn whatever they are interested in
D)teaching can be designed to promote boys’ team spirit
50.Which of the following is characteristic of boys according to Abigail James’ report?
A) They enjoy being in charge. C)They have sharper vision. B)They conform to stereotypes.
D) They are violent and sexist.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　It's an annual argument. Do we or do we not go on holiday? My partner says no because the boiler could go, or the roof fall off, and we have no savings to save us. I say you only live once and we work hard and what's the point if you can't go on holiday.The joy of a recession means no argument next year—we just won't go.
　　Since money is known to be one of the things most likely to bring a relationship to its knees, we should be grateful. For many families the recession means more than not booking a holiday. A YouGov poll of 2,000 people found 22% said they were arguing more with their partners because of concerns about money.What's less clear is whether divorce and separation rates rise in a recession— financial pressures mean couples argue more but make splitting up less affordable. A recent research shows arguments about money were especially damaging to couples. Disputes were characterised by intense verbal( 言语上的) aggression, tended to be repeated and not resolved, and made men, more than women, extremely angry.
Kim Stephenson，an occupational psychologist，believes money is such a big deal
because of what it symbolises, which may be different things to men and women. “People can say the same things about money but have different ideas of what it's for,” he explains. “They'll say it's to save, to spend, for security, for freedom,to show someone you love them.” He says men are more likely to see money as a way of buying status and of showing their parents that they've achieved something.
　　“The biggest problem is that couples assume each other knows what's going on with their finances, but they don't. There seems to be  more of a taboo( 禁忌) about talking about money than about death. But you both need to know what you're doing,who's

paying what into the joint account and how much you keep separately. In a healthy relationship, you don't have to agree about money, but you have to talk about it.”
51.What does the author say about vacationing?
A) People enjoy it all the more during a recession.
C) It makes all the hard work worthwhile.
B) Few people can afford it without working hard.
D) It is the chief cause of family disputes.

52.What does the author mean by saying “money is known..to bring a relationship to its knees”(Line 1, Para.2)?
A) Money is considered to be the root of all evils.
C) Few people can resist the temptation of money.
B) Some people sacrifice their dignity for money.
D) Disputes over money may ruin a relationship.

53.The YouGov poll of 2,000 people indicates that in a recession	.
A) conflicts between couples tend to rise
C) couples show more concern for each other
B) it is more expensive for couples to split up
D) divorce and separation rates increase

54.What does Kim Stephenson believe?
A) Money is often a symbol of a person's status. C)Men and women spend money on different things. B)Money means a great deal to both men and women.
D) Men and women view money in different ways.

55.The author suggests at the end of the passage that couples should	.
A)put their money together instead of keeping it separately
B)make efforts to reach agreement on their family budgets
C)discuss money matters to maintain a healthy relationship
D)avoid arguing about money matters to remain romantic

Part III	Reading Comprehension	(40 minutes)
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Question 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　　Children do not think the way adults do. For most of the first year of life, if something is out of sight, it’s out of mind. If you cover a baby’s 26 toy with a piece of cloth, the baby thinks the toy has disappeared and stops looking for it. A 4-year-old may
27    that a sister has more fruit juice when it is only the shapes of the glasses that differ, not the 28 of juice.
　　Yet children are smart in their own way. Like good little scientists, children are always testing their child-sized     29     about how things work. When your child throws her spoon on the floor for the sixth time as you try to feed her, and you say, “That’s enough! I will not pick up your spoon again!” the child will    30     test your claim. Are you serious? Are you angry? What will happen if she throws the spoon again? She is not doing this to drive you    31; rather, she is learning that her desires and yours can differ, and that sometimes those 32 are important and sometimes they are not.
　　How and why does children’s thinking change? In the 1920s, Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget proposed that children’s cognitive (认知的) abilities unfold 33 , like the blooming of a flower, almost independent of what else is 34   in their lives. Although many of his specific conclusions have been 35 or modified over the years, his ideas inspired thousands of studies by investigators all over the world.

The Perfect Essay

A)Looking back on too many years of education, I can identify one truly impossible teacher. She cared about me, and my intellectual life, even when I didn’t. Her expectations were high—impossibly so. She was an English teacher. She was also my mother.
B)When good students turn in an essay, they dream of their instructor returning it to them in exactly the same condition, save for a single word added in the margin of the final page: “Flawless”. This dream came true for me one afternoon in the ninth grade. Of course, I had heard that genius could show itself at an early age, so I was only slightly taken aback that I had achieved perfection at the tender age of 14. Obviously, I did what any professional writer would do; I hurried off to spread the good news. I didn’t get very far. The first person I told was my mother.
C)My mother, who is just shy of five feet tall, is normally incredibly soft-spoken, but on the rare occasion when she got angry, she was terrifying. I am not sure if she was more upset by my hubris (得意忘形) or by the fact that my English teacher had let my ego get so out of hand. In any event, my mother and her red pen showed me how deeply flawed a flawless essay could be. At the time, I am sure she thought she was teaching me about mechanics, transitions (过渡), structure, style and voice. But what I learned, and what stuck with me through my time teaching writing at Harvard, was a deeper lesson about the nature of creative criticism.
D)First off, it hurts. Genuine criticism, the type that leaves a lasting mark on you as a writer, also leaves an existential imprint ( 印记) on you as a person. I have heard people say that a writer should never take criticism personally. I say that we should never listen to these people.
E)Criticism, at its best, is deeply personal, and gets to the heart of why we write the way we do. The intimate nature of genuine criticism implies something about who is able to give it, namely, someone who knows you well enough to show you how your mental life is getting in the way of good writing. Conveniently, they are also the people who care enough to see you through this painful realization. For me it took the form of my first, and I hope only, encounter with writer’s block--I was not able to produce anything for three years.

F)Franz Kafka once said: “Writing is utter solitude ( 独处), the descent into the cold abyss ( 深渊) of oneself.” My mother’s criticism had shown me that Kafka is right about the cold abyss, and when you make the introspective (内省的) descent that writing requires you are not always pleased by what you find. But, in the years that followed, her sustained tutoring suggested that Kafka might be wrong about the solitude. I was lucky enough to find a critic and teacher who was willing to make the journey of writing with me. “It is a thing of no great difficulty,” according to Plutarch, “to raise objections against another man’s speech, it is a very easy matter; but to produce a better in its place is a work extremely troublesome.” I am sure I wrote essays in the later years of high school without my mother's guidance, but I can’t recall them. What I remember, however, is how she took up the "extremely troublesome" work of ongoing criticism.

G)There are two ways to interpret Plutarch when he suggests that a critic should be able to produce “a better in its place.” In a straightforward sense, he could mean that a critic must be more talented than the artist she critiques (评论). My mother was well covered on this count. But perhaps Plutarch is suggesting something slightly different, something a bit closer to Marcus Cicero’s claim that one should “criticize by creation, not by finding fault.” Genuine criticism creates a precious opening for an author to become better on his own terms--a process that is often extremely painful, but also almost always meaningful.
H)My mother said she would help me with my writing, but first I had to help myself. For each assignment, I was to write the best essay I could. Real criticism is not meant to find obvious mistakes, so if she found any--the type I could have found on my own--I had to start from scratch. From scratch. Once the essay was “flawless,” she would take an evening to walk me through my errors. That was when true criticism, the type that changed me as a person, began.
I)She criticized me when I included little-known references and professional jargon (行话). She had no patience for brilliant but irrelevant figures of speech. “Writers can’t bluff (虚张声势) their way through ignorance.” That was news to me--I would need to freed another way to structure my daily existence.
J)She trimmed back my flowery language, drew lines through my exclamation marks and argued for the value of restraint in expression. “John,” she almost whispered. I leaned in to hear her: “I can’t hear you when you shout at me.” So I stopped shouting and bluffing, and slowly my writing improved.
K)Somewhere along the way I set aside my hopes of writing that flawless essay. But perhaps I missed something important in my mother’s lessons about creativity and perfection. Perhaps the point of writing the flawless essay was not to give up, but to never willingly finish. Whitman repeatedly reworked “Song of Myself” between 1855

and 1891 repeatedly. We do our absolute best with a piece of writing, and come as close as we can to the ideal. And, for the time being, we settle. In critique, however, we are forced to depart, to give up the perfection we thought we had achieved for the chance of being even a little bit better. This is the lesson I took from my mother: If perfection were possible, it would not be motivating?
36.The author was advised against the improper use of figures of speech.

37.The author’s mother taught him a valuable lesson by pointing out lots of flaws in his seemingly perfect essay.
38.A writer should polish his writing repeatedly so as to get closer to perfection.

39.Writers may experience periods of time in their life when they just can’t produce anything.

40.The author was not much surprised when his school teacher marked his essay as “flawless”.

41.Criticizing someone’s speech is said to be easier than coming up with a better one.

42.The author looks upon his mother as his most demanding and caring instructor.

43.The criticism the author received from his mother changed him as a person.

44.The author gradually improved his writing by avoiding fancy language.

45.Constructive criticism gives an author a good start to improve his writing.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A)， B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　Could you reproduce Silicon Valley elsewhere, or is there something unique about it? It wouldn’t be surprising if it were hard to reproduce in other countries, because you couldn't reproduce it in most of the US either. What does it take to make a Silicon Valley? It’s the right people. If you could get the right ten thousand people to move from
Silicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalo would become Silicon Valley.
　　You only need two kinds of people to create a technology hub (中心) : rich people and nerds (痴迷科研的人).
　　Observation bears this out. Within the US, towns have become star, up hubs if and only if they have both rich people and nerds. Few startups happen in Miami, for example, because although it’s full of rich people, it has few nerds. It's not the kind of place nerds like.

　　Whereas Pittsburgh has the opposite problem: plenty of nerds, but no rich people. The top US Computer Science departments are said to be MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon. MIT yielded Route 128. Stanford and Berkeley yielded Silicon Valley. But what did Carnegie-Mellon yield in Pittsburgh? And what happened in Ithaca, home of Cornell University, which is also high on the list?
　　I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to college at Cornell, so I can answer for both. The weather is terrible, particularly in winter, and there's no interesting old city to make up for it, as there is in Boston. Rich people don't want to live in Pittsburgh or Ithaca. So while there’re plenty of hackers (电脑迷) who could start startups, there’s no one to invest in them.
　　Do you really need the rich people? Wouldn’t it work to have the government invest in the nerds?
　　No, it would not. Startup investors are a distinct type of rich people. They tend to have a lot of experience themselves in the technology business. This helps them pick the right startups, and means they can supply advice and connections as well as money. And the fact that they have a personal stake in the outcome makes them really pay attention.

46.What do we learn about Silicon Valley from the passage?
A)Its success is hard to copy anywhere else.
B)It is the biggest technology hub in the US.
C)Its fame in high technology is incomparable.
D)It leads the world in information technology.

47.What makes Miami unfit to produce a Silicon Valley?
A)Lack of incentive for investment.
B)Lack of the right kind of talents.
C)Lack of government support.
D)Lack of famous universities.

48.In what way is Carnegie-Mellon different from Stanford, Berkeley and MIT?
A)Its location is not as attractive to rich people.
B)Its science departments are not nearly as good.
C)It does not produce computer hackers and nerds.
D)It does not pay much attention to business startups.

49.What does the author imply about Boston?
A)It has pleasant weather all year round.
B)It produces wealth as well as high-tech.
C)It is not likely to attract lots of investors and nerds.
D)It is an old city with many sites of historical interest.

50.What does the author say about startup investors?

A)They are especially wise in making investments.
B)They have good connections in the government.
C)They can do more than providing money.
D)They are rich enough to invest in nerds.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　It’s nice to have people of like mind around. Agreeable people boost your confidence and allow you to relax and feel comfortable. Unfortunately, that comfort can hinder the very learning that can expand your company and your career.
　　It’s nice to have people agree, but you need conflicting perspectives to dig out the truth. If everyone around you has similar views, your work will suffer from confirmation bias (偏颇).
　　Take a look at your own network. Do your contacts share your point of view on most subjects? If yes, it’s time to shake things up. As a leader, it can be challenging to create an environment in which people will freely disagree and argue, but as the saying goes: From confrontation comes brilliance.
　　It’s not easy for most people to actively seek conflict. Many spend their lives trying to avoid arguments. There’s no need to go out and find people you hate, but you need to do some self-assessment to determine where you have become stale in your thinking. You may need to start by encouraging your current network to help you identify your blind spots.
　　Passionate, energetic debate does not require anger and hard feelings to be effective. But it does require moral strength. Once you have worthy opponents, set some ground rules so everyone understands responsibilities and boundaries. The objective of this debating game is not to win but to get to the truth that will allow you to move faster, farther, and better.
　　Fierce debating can hurt feelings, particularly when strong personalities are involved. Make sure you check in with your opponents so that they are not carrying the emotion of the battles beyond the battlefield. Break the tension with smiles and humor to reinforce the idea that this is friendly discourse and that all are working toward a common goal.
　　Reward all those involved in the debate sufficiently when the goals are reached. Let your sparring partners ( 拳击陪练) know how much you appreciate their contribution. The more they feel appreciated, the more they'll be willing to get into the ring next time.

51.What happens when you have like-minded people around you all the while?
A)It will help your company expand more rapidly.
B)It will create a harmonious working atmosphere.
C)It may prevent your business and career from advancing.
D)It may make you feel uncertain about your own decisions.

52.What does the author suggest leaders do?
A)Avoid arguments with business partners.
B)Encourage people to disagree and argue.
C)Build a wide and strong business network.
D)Seek advice from their worthy competitors.

53.What is the purpose of holding a debate?
A)To find out the truth about an issue.
B)To build up people's moral strength.
C)To remove misunderstandings.
D)To look for worthy opponents.

54.What advice does the author give to people engaged in a fierce debate?
A)They listen carefully to their opponents' views.
B)They show due respect for each other's beliefs.
C)They present their views clearly and explicitly.
D)They take care not to hurt each other’s feelings.

55.How should we treat our rivals after a successful debate?
A)Try to make peace with them.
B)Try to make up the differences.
C)Invite them to the ring next time.
D)Acknowledge their contribution.

Question 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　Scholars of the information society are divided over whether social inequality decreases or increases in an information-based society. However, they generally agree with the idea that inequality in the information society is       26       different from that of an industrial society. As information progresses in society, the cause and structural nature of social inequality changes as well.
　　It seems that the information society       27       the quantity of information available to the members of a society by revolutionizing the ways of using and exchanging information. But such a view is a 28 analysis based on the quantity of information supplied by various forms of the mass media. A different 29 is possible when the

actual amount of information 30 by the user is taken into account. In fact, the more information 31 throughout the entire society, the wider the gap becomes between “information haves” and “information have-nots”, leading to digital divide.
　　According to recent studies, digital divide has been caused by three major   32   : class, sex, and generation. In terms of class, digital divide exists among different types of workers and between the upper and middle classes and the lower class. With      33    to sex, digital divide exists between men and women. The greatest gap, however, is between the Net-generation, 34   with personal computers and the Internet, and the older generation, 35 to an industrial society.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Joy: A Subject Schools Lack

Becoming educated should not require giving up pleasure
A)When Jonathan Swift proposed, in 1729, that the people of Ireland eat their children, he insisted it would solve three problems at once: feed the hungry masses, reduce the population during a severe depression, and stimulate the restaurant business. Even as a satire ( 讽刺), it seems disgusting and shocking in America with its child-centered culture. But actually, the country is closer to his proposal than you might think.
B)If you spend much time with educators and policy makers, you’ll hear a lot of the following words: “standards,” “results,” “skills,” “self-control,” “accountability,” and so on. I have visited some of the newer supposedly “effective” schools, where children shout slogans in order to learn self- control or must stand behind their desk when they can’t sit still.
C)A look at what goes on in most classrooms these days makes it abundantly clear that

when people think about education, they are not thinking about what it feels like to be a child, or what makes childhood an important and valuable stage of life in its own right.
D)I’m a mother of three, a teacher, and a developmental psychologist. So I’ve watched a lot of children—talking, playing, arguing, eating, studying, and being young. Here’s what I’ve come to understand. The thing that sets children apart from adults is not their ignorance, nor their lack of skills. It’s their enormous capacity for joy. Think of a 3-year-old lost in the pleasures of finding out what he can and cannot sink in the bathtub, a 5-year-old beside herself with the thrill of putting together strings of nonsensical words with her best friends, or an 11-year-old completely absorbed in a fascinating comic strip. A child’s ability to become deeply absorbed in something, and derive intense pleasure from that absorption, is something adults spend the rest of their lives trying to return to.
E)A friend told me the following story. One day, when he went to get his 7-year-old son from soccer practice, his kid greeted him with a downcast face and a sad voice. The coach had criticized him for not focusing on his soccer drills. The little boy walked out of the school with his head and shoulders hanging down. He seemed wrapped in sadness. But just before he reached the car door, he suddenly stopped, crouching (蹲伏) down to peer at something on the sidewalk. His face went down lower and lower, and then, with complete joy he called out, “Dad. Come here. This is the strangest bug I’ve ever seen. It has, like, a million legs. Look at this. It’s amazing.” He looked up at his father, his features overflowing with energy and delight. “Can’t we stay here for just a minute? I want to find out what he does with all those legs. This is the coolest ever.”

F)The traditional view of such moments is that they constitute a charming but irrelevant byproduct of youth—something to be pushed aside to make room for more important qualities, like perseverance (坚持不懈）, obligation, and practicality. Yet moments like this one are just the kind of intense absorption and pleasure adults spend the rest of their lives seeking. Human lives are governed by the desire to experience joy. Becoming educated should not require giving up joy but rather lead to finding joy in new kinds of things: reading novels instead of playing with small figures, conducting experiments instead of sinking cups in the bathtub, and debating serious issues rather than stringing together nonsense words, for example. In some cases, schools should help children find new, more grown-up ways of doing the same things that are constant sources of joy: making art, making friends, making decisions.
G)Building on a child’s ability to feel joy, rather than pushing it aside, wouldn’t be that hard. It would just require  a shift in the education world’s mindset（ 思维模式） . Instead of trying to get children to work hard, why not focus on getting them to take

pleasure in meaningful, productive activity, like making things, working with others, exploring ideas, and solving problems? These focuses are not so different from the things in which they delight.
H)Before you brush this argument aside as rubbish, or think of joy as an unaffordable luxury in a nation where there is awful poverty, low academic achievement, and high dropout rates, think again. The more horrible the school circumstances, the more important pleasure is to achieving any educational success.
I)Many of the assignments and rules teachers come up with, often because they are pressured by their administrators, treat pleasure and joy as the enemies of competence and responsibility. The assumption is that children shouldn’t chat in the classroom because it hinders hard work; instead, they should learn to delay gratification (快乐） so that they can pursue abstract goals, like going to college.
J)Not only is this a boring and awful way to treat children, it makes no sense educationally. Decades of research have shown that in order to acquire skills and real knowledge in school, kids need to want to learn. You can force a child to stay in his or her seat, fill out a worksheet, or practice division. But you can’t force the child to think carefully, enjoy books, digest complex information, or develop a taste for learning. To make that happen, you have to help the child find pleasure in learning—to see school as a source of joy.
K)Adults tend to talk about learning as if it were medicine: unpleasant, but necessary and good for you. Why not instead think of learning as if it were food—something so valuable to humans that they have evolved to experience it as a pleasure?
L)Joy should not be trained out of children or left for after-school programs. The more difficult a child’s life circumstances, the more important it is for that child to find joy in his or her classroom. “Pleasure” is not a dirty word. And it doesn’t run counter to the goals of public education. It is, in fact, the precondition.
36.It will not be difficult to make learning a source of joy if educators change their way of thinking.
37.What distinguishes children from adults is their strong ability to derive joy from what they are doing.
38.Children in America are being treated with shocking cruelty.
39.It is human nature to seek joy in life.
40.Grown-ups are likely to think that learning to children is what medicine is to patients.
41.Bad school conditions make it all the more important to turn learning into a joyful experience.
42.Adults do not consider children’s feelings when it comes to education.

43.Administrators seem to believe that only hard work will lead children to their educational goals.
44.In the so-called “effective” schools, children are taught self-control under a set of strict rules.

Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B),
C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on
Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One

Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.

　　When it’s five o’clock, people leave their office. The length of the workday, for many workers, is defined by time. They leave when the clock tells them they’re done.
　　These days, the time is everywhere: not just on clocks or watches, but on cell-phones and computers. That may be a bad thing, particularly at work. New research shows that clock-based work schedules hinder morale  (士气) and creativity.
　　Clock-timers organize their day by blocks of minutes and hours. For example: a meeting from 9 a. m. to 10 a. m. , research from 10 a. m. to noon, etc. On the other hand, task-timers have a list of things they want to accomplish. They work down the list, each task starts when the previous task is completed. It is said that all of us employ a mix of both these types of planning.
　　What, then, are the effects of thinking about time in these different ways? Does one make us more productive? Better at the tasks at hand? Happier? In experiments conducted by Tamar Avnet and Anne-Laure Sellier, they had participants organize different activities—from project planning, holiday shopping, to yoga—by time or to-do list to measure how they performed under “clock time vs “task time.” They found clock timers to be more efficient but less happy because they felt little control over their lives. Task timers are happier and more creative, but less productive. They tend to enjoy the moment when something good is happening, and seize opportunities that come up.
　　The researchers argue that task-based organizing tends to be undervalued and under-supported in business culture. Smart companies, they believe, will try to bake more task-based planning into their strategies.
　　This might be a small change to the way we view work and the office, but the researchers argue that it challenges a widespread characteristic of the economy: work organized by dock time. While most people will still probably need, and be, to some

extent, clock-timers, task-based timing should be used when performing a job that requires more creativity. It’ll make those tasks easier, arid the task- doers will be happier.
46.What does the author think of time displayed everywhere?
A)It makes everybody time-conscious.
B)It is a convenience for work and life.
C)It may have a negative effect on creative work.
D)It clearly indicates the fast pace of modem life.

47.How do people usually go about their work according to the author?
A)They combine clock-based and task-based planning.
B)They give priority to the most urgent task on hand.
C)They set a time limit for each specific task.
D)They accomplish their tasks one by one.

48.What did Tamar Avnet and Anne-Laure Sellier find in their experiments about clocks timers?
A)They seize opportunities as they come up.
B)They always get their work done in time.
C)They have more control over their lives.
D)They tend to be more productive.

49.What do the researchers say about today’s business culture?
A)It does not support the strategies adopted by smart companies.
B)It does not attach enough importance to task-based practice.
C)It places more emphasis on work efficiency than on workers’ lives.
D)It aims to bring employees, potential and creativity into full play.

50.What do the researchers suggest?
A)Task-based timing is preferred for doing creative work.
B)It is important to keep a balance between work and life.
C)Performing creative jobs tends to make workers happier.
D)A scientific standard should be adopted in job evaluation.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Martha Stewart was charged, tried and competed of a crime in 2004. As she neared the end of her prison sentence, a well-known columnist wrote that she was “paying her dues,” and that “there is simply no reason for anyone to attempt to deny her right to start anew.”
　　Surely, the American ideal of second chances should not be reserved only for the rich and powerful. Unfortunately, many federal and state laws impose post-conviction

restrictions on a shockingly large number of Americans, who are prevented from ever fully paying their debt to society.
　　At least 65 million people in the United States have a criminal record. This can result in severe penalties that continue long after punishment is completed.
　　Many of these penalties are imposed regardless of the seriousness of the offense or the person’s individual circumstances. Laws can restrict or ban voting, access to public housing, and professional and business licensing. They can affect a person’s ability to get a job and qualification for benefits.
　　In all, more than 45, 000 laws and rules serve to exclude vast numbers of people from fully participating in American life.
Some laws make sense. No one advocates letting someone convicted of pedophilia
（恋童癖）work in a school. But too often collateral (附随的）consequences bear no relation to public safety. Should a woman who possessed a small amount of drugs years ago be permanently unable to be licensed as a nurse?
　　These laws are also counterproductive, since they make it harder for people with criminal records to find housing or land a job, two key factors that reduce backsliding.
　　A recent report makes several recommendations, including the abolition of most post-conviction penalties, except for those specifically needed to protect public safety. Where the penalties are not a must, they should be imposed only if the facts of a case support it.
　　The point is not to excuse or forget the crime. Rather, it is to recognize that in America’s vast criminal justice system, second chances are crucial. It is in no one’s interest to keep a large segment of the population on the margins of society.
51.What does the well-known columnist’s remark about Martha Stewart suggest?
A)Her past record might stand in her way to a new life.
B)Her business went bankrupt while she was in prison.
C)Her release from prison has drawn little attention.
D)Her prison sentence might have been extended.

52.What do we learn from the second paragraph about many criminals in America?
A)They backslide after serving their terms in prison.
B)They are deprived of chances to turn over a new leaf.
C)They receive severe penalties for committing minor offenses.
D)They are convicted regardless of their individual circumstances.

53.What are the consequences for many Americans with a criminal record?
A)They remain poor for the rest of their lives.

B)They are deprived of all social benefits.
C)They are marginalized in society.
D)They are deserted by their family.

54.What does the author think of the post-conviction laws and rules?
A)They help to maintain social stability.
B)Some of them have long been outdated.
C)They are hardly understood by the public.
D)A lot of them have negative effects on society.

55.What is the author’s main purpose in writing the passage?
A)To create opportunities for criminals to reform themselves.
B)To appeal for changes in America’s criminal justice system.
C)To ensure that people with a criminal record live a decent life.
D)To call people’s attention to prisoners’ conditions in America.

Listening Is More Important than Talking
　　Nowadays an old saying, “Listening is more important than talking”, comes into vogue. The saying tells us the true essence of communication with others in the society,
which means paying attention to others ’	opinions is much more important than
expressing one’s own words.
　　As for me, there are two reasons accounting for the correctness of this principle. To start with, listening shows your respect for others. In such a competitive society, willingness to listen can make you gain trust and friendship, which is the basic rule of socialization. A talkative person without ear is doomed to be alienated. Furthermore, listening can really benefit yourself. There is no denying that you are the one to make choices in your life. However, a variety of ideas from others will definitely enrich your mind and present some enlightenment to your future actions.
　　According to what is said above, listening truly outweighs talking on many occasions. In modern society, we need to master some communication skills. Only when we realize the importance of listening can we lead a better life.

Part IV	Translation
　　Chinese parents usually intend to pay too much attention to their children’s study to such an extent that they even don’ t require their children to help them do the chores. Their primary requirement for their children is to study hard, get good grades and go to famous universities. They believe this does good to their children because in the society of China which is full of intense competition, only perfect academic performance can ensure a bright future. Chinese parents also believe if their children can make great achievements in the society, they will receive respect accordingly. Therefore, they are willing to sacrifice their own time, hobbies and interests to provide better conditions for their children.

Question 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　　For many Americans, 2013 ended with an unusually bitter cold spell. Late November and December     36    early snow and bone-chilling temperatures in much of the country, part of a year when, for the first time in two   37    , record-cold days will likely turn out to have outnumbered record-warm ones. But the U. S. was the exception: November was the warmest ever 38   , and current data indicates that 2013 is likely to have been the fourth hottest year on record.
　　Enjoy the snow now, because      39      are good that 2014 will be even hotter, perhaps the hottest year since records have been kept. That’s because, scientists are predicting, 2014 will be an El Nino year.

So large is the Pacific, covering 30% of the planet’s surface, that the      41      energy generated by its warming is enough to touch off a series of weather changes around the world. El Ninos are 42 with abnormally dry conditions in Southeast Asia and Australia. They can lead to extreme rain in parts of North and South America, even as southern Africa 43 dry weather. Marine life may be affected too: El Ninos can 44   the rising of the cold, nutrient-rich（营养丰富的） water that supports large fish 45   , and the unusually warm ocean temperatures can destroy coral（珊瑚）.











Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

How to Eat Well
A)Why do so many Americans eat tons of processed food, the stuff that is correctly called junk (垃圾）and should really carry warning labels?
B)It’s not because fresh ingredients are hard to come by. Supermarkets offer more

variety than ever, and there are over four times as many farmers, markets in the U. S. as there were 20 years ago. Nor is it for lack of available information. There are plenty of recipes（食谱）how-to videos and cooking classes available to anyone who has a computer, smartphone or television. If anything, the information is overwhelming.
C)And yet we aren’t cooking. If you eat three meals a day and behave like most Americans, you probably get at least a third of your daily calories (卡路里）outside the home. Nearly two thirds of us grab fast food once a week, and we get almost 25% of our daily calories from snacks. So we’re eating out or taking in, and we don’t sit down—or we do, but we hurry.
D)Shouldn’t preparing—and consuming—food be a source of comfort, pride, health, well-being, relaxation, sociability? Something that connects us to other humans? Why

would we want to outsourc（e
harmful?

外包）this basic task, especially when outsourcing it is so


E)When I talk about cooking, I’m not talking about creating elaborate dinner parties or three-day science projects. I’m talking about simple, easy, everyday meals. My mission is to encourage green hands and those lacking time or money to feed themselves. That means we need modest, realistic expectations, and we need to teach people to cook food that’s good enough to share with family and friends.”
F)Perhaps a return to real cooking needn’t be far off. A recent Harris poll revealed that 79% of Americans say they enjoy cooking and 30% “love it”; 14% admit to not enjoying kitchen work and just 7% won’t go near the stove at all. But this doesn’t necessarily translate to real cooking, and the result of this survey shouldn’t surprise anyone: 52% of those 65 or older cook at home five or more times per week; only a third of young people do.
G)Back in the 1950s most of us grew up in households where Mom cooked virtually every night. The intention to put a home-cooked meal on the table was pretty much universal. Most people couldn’t afford to do otherwise.
H)Although frozen dinners were invented in the 40s, their popularity didn’t boom until televisions became popular a decade or so later. Since then, packaged, pre-prepared meals have been what’s for dinner. The microwave and fast-food chains were the biggest catalyst (催化剂）, but the big food companies—which want to sell anything except the raw ingredients that go into cooking—made the home cook an endangered species.
I)Still, I find it strange that only a third of young people report preparing meals at home regularly. Isn’t this the same crowd that rails against processed junk and champions craft cooking? And isn’t this the generation who say they’ve concerned about their health and the well-being of the planet? If these are truly the values of many young

people, then their behavior doesn’t match their beliefs.

J)There have been half-hearted but well-publicized efforts by some food companies to reduce calories in their processed foods, but the Standard American Diet is still the polar opposite of the healthy, mostly plant-based diet that just about every expert says we should be eating. Considering that the government’s standards are not nearly ambitious enough, the picture is clear: by not cooking at home, we’re not eating the right things, and the consequences are hard to overstate.
K)To help quantify（量化）costs of a poor diet, I recently tried to estimate this impact in terms of a most famous food, the burger（汉堡包）. I concluded that the profit from burgers is more than offset（抵消）by the damage they cause in health problems and environmental harm?
L)Cooking real food is the best defense—not to mention that any meal you’ve likely to eat at home contains about 200 fewer calories than one you would eat in a restaurant.
M)	To those Americans for whom money is a concern, my advice is simple: Buy what you can afford, and cook it yourself. The common prescription is to primarily shop the grocery store, since that’s where fresh produce, meat and seafood, and dairy are. And to save money and still eat well you don’t need local, organic ingredients; all you need is real food. I’m not saying local food isn’t better; it is. But there is plenty of decent food in the grocery stores.
N)The other sections you should get to know are the frozen foods and the canned goods. Frozen produce is still produce; canned tomatoes are still tomatoes. Just make sure you’re getting real food without tons of added salt or sugar. Ask yourself, would Grandma consider this food? Does it look like something that might occur in nature? It’s pretty much common sense: you want to buy food, not unidentifiable foodlike objects.
O)You don’t have to hit the grocery store daily, nor do you need an abundance of skill. Since fewer than half of Americans say they cook at an intermediate level and only 20% describe their cooking skills as advanced, the crisis is one of confidence. And the only remedy for that is practice. There’s nothing mysterious about cooking the evening meal. You just have to do a little thinking ahead and redefine what qualifies as dinner. Like any skill, cooking gets easier as you do it more; every time you cook, you advance your level of skills. Someday you won’t even need recipes. My advice is that you not pay attention to the number of steps and ingredients, because they can be deceiving.
P)Time, I realize, is the biggest obstacle to cooking for most people. You must adjust your priorities to find time to cook. For instance, you can move a TV to the kitchen and watch your favorite shows while you’re standing at the sink. No one is asking you

to give up activities you like, but if you’re watching food shows on TV, try cooking instead.
36.Cooking benefits people in many ways and enables them to connect with one another.

37.Abundant information about cooking is available either online or on TV.

38.Young people do less cooking at home than the elderly these days.

39.Cooking skills can be improved with practice.

40.In the mid-20th century, most families ate dinner at home instead of eating out.

41.Even those short of time or money should be encouraged to cook for themselves and their family.
42.Eating food not cooked by ourselves can cause serious consequences.

43.To eat well and still save money, people should buy fresh food and cook it themselves.
44.We get a fairly large portion of calories from fast food and snacks.

45.The popularity of TV led to the popularity of frozen food.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B),
C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on
Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　The wallet is heading for extinction. As a day-to-day essential, it will die off with the generation who read print newspapers. The kind of shopping—where you hand over notes and count out change in return—now happens only in the most minor of our retail encounters, like buying a bar of chocolate or a pint of milk from a comer shop. At the shops where you spend any real money, that money is increasingly abstracted. And this is more and more true, the higher up the scale you go. At the most cutting-edge retail stores—Victoria Beckham on Dover Street, for instance—you don’t go and stand at any kind of cash register when you decide to pay. The staff are equipped with iPads to take your payment while you relax on a sofa.
　　Which is nothing more or less than excellent service, if you have the money. But across society, the abstraction of the idea of cash makes me uneasy. Maybe I’m just old-fashioned. But earning money isn’t quick or easy for most of us. Isn’t it a bit weird that spending it should happen in half a blink (眨眼）of an eye? Doesn’t a wallet—that

time-honoured Friday-night feeling of pleasing, promising fatness—represent something that matters?
　　But I’ll leave the economics to the experts. What bothers me about the death of the wallet is the change it represents in our physical environment. Everything about the look and feel of a wallet—the way the fastenings and materials wear and tear and loosen with age, the plastic and paper and gold and silver, and handwritten phone numbers and printed cinema tickets—is the very opposite of what our world is becoming. The opposite of a wallet is a smartphone or an iPad. The rounded edges, cool glass, smooth and unknowable as a pebble (鹅卵石）. Instead of digging through pieces of paper and peering into comers, we move our fingers left and right. No more counting out coins. Show your wallet, if you still have one. It may not be here much longer.

46.What is happening to the wallet?
A)It is disappearing.
B)It is being fattened.
C)It is becoming costly,
D)It is changing in style.

47.How are business transactions done in big modern stores?
A)Individually.
B)Electronically.
C)In the abstract.
D)Via a cash register.

48.What makes the author feel uncomfortable nowadays?
A)Saving money is becoming a thing of the past.
B)The pleasing Friday-night feeling is fading.
C)Earning money is getting more difficult.
D)Spending money is so fast and easy.

49.Why does the author choose to write about what’s happening to the wallet?
A)It represents a change in the modem world.
B)It has something to do with everybody’s life.
C)It marks the end of a time-honoured tradition.
D)It is the concern of contemporary economists.

50.What can we infer from the passage about the author?
A)He is resistant to social changes.
B)He is against technological progress.
C)He feels reluctant to part with the traditional wallet.
D)He feels insecure in the ever-changing modem world.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Everybody sleeps, but what people stay up late to catch—or wake up early in order not to miss— varies by culture.
　　From data collected, it seems the things that cause us to lose the most sleep, on average, are sporting events, time changes, and holidays.
　　Around the world, people changed sleep patterns thanks to the start or end of daylight savings time, Russians, for example, began to wake up about a half-hour later each day after President Vladimir Putin shifted the country permanently to “winter time” starting on October 26.
　　Russia’s other late nights and early mornings generally correspond to public holidays. On New Year’s Eve, Russians have the world’s latest bedtime, hitting the hay at around 3:30 a.m.
　　Russians also get up an hour later on International Women’s Day, the day for treating and celebrating female relatives.
　　Similarly, Americans, late nights, late mornings, and longest sleeps fall on three-day weekends. Canada got the least sleep of the year the night it beat Sweden in the Olympic hockey （冰球）. The World Cup is also chiefly responsible for sleep deprivation (剥夺）. The worst night for sleep in the U. K was the night of the England-Italy match on June 14. Brits stayed up a half-hour later to watch it, and then they woke up earlier than usual the next morning thanks to summer nights, the phenomenon in which the sun barely sets in northern countries in the summertime. That was nothing, though, compared to Germans, Italians, and the French, who stayed up around an hour and a half later on various days throughout the summer to watch the Cup.
　　It should be made clear that not everyone has a device to record their sleep patterns; in some of these nations, it’s likely that only the richest people do. And people who elect to track their sleep may try to get more sleep than the average person. Even if that’s the case, though, the above findings are still striking.

  Physical activity does the body good, and there's growing evidence that it helps the brain too.Researchers in the Netherlands report that children who get more exercise, whether at school or on their own.   26   to have higher GPAs and better scores on standardized tests.In a   27   of 14 studies that looked at physical activity and academic   28  , investigators found that the more children moved.the better their grades were in school,   29   in the basic subjects of math, English and reading.
  The data will certainly fuel the ongoing debate over whether physical education classes should be cut as schools struggle to   30   on smaller budgets.The arguments against physical education have included
 concerns that gym time may be taking away from study time.With standardized test scores in the U.S.  31   in recent years, some administrators believe students need to spend more time in the classroom instead of on the playground.But as these findings show,exercise and academics may not be   32   exclusive.Physical activity can improve blood   33   to the brain, fueling memory,attention and creativity,which are   34   to learning. And exercise releases hormones that can improve   35   and relieve stress, which can also help learning.So while it may seem as if kids are just exercising their bodies when they, re running around, they may actually be exercising their brains as well.

Finding the Right Home—and Contentment, Too

A. When your elderly relative needs to enter some sort of long.term care facility-a moment few parents or children approach without fear-what you would like is to have everything made clear.

B. Does assisted living really mark a great improvement over a nursing home, or has the industry simply hired better interior designers?Are nursing homes as bad as people fear, or is that an out-moded stereotype(固定看法)?Can doing one's homework really steer families to the best places?It is genuinely hard to know.

C. I am about to make things more complicated by suggesting that what kind of facility an older person lives in may matter less than we have assumed.And that the characteristics adult children look for when they begin the search are not necessarily the things that make a difference to the people who are going to move in.I am not talking about the quality of care, let me hastily add.Nobody flourishes in a gloomy environment with irresponsible staff and a poor safety record.But an accumulating body of research indicates that some distinctions between one type of elder care and another have little real bearing on how well residents do.

D. The most recent of these studies, published in The Journal of Applied Gerontology, surveyed 150 Connecticut residents of assisted living, nursing homes and smaller residential care homes(known in some states as board and care homes or adult care homes).Researchers from the University of Connecticut Health Center asked the residents a large number of questions about their quality of life, emotional well-being and social interaction, as well as about the quality of the facilities.

E. "We thought we would see differences based on the housing types, "said the lead author of the study, Julie Robison, an associate professor of medicine at the university.A reasonable assumption-don't families struggle to avoid nursing homes and suffer real guilt if they can't?

F. In the initial results, assisted living residents did paint the most positive picture.They were less likely to report symptoms of depression than those in the other facilities, for instance, and less likely to be bored or lonely.They scored higher on social interaction.

G. But when the researchers plugged in a number of other variables, such differences disappeared.It is not the housing type, they found, that creates differences in residents' responses."It is the characteristics of the specific environment they are in, combined with their own personal characteristics-how healthy they feel they are, their age and marital status, "Dr.Robison explained.Whether residents felt involved in the decision to move and how long they had lived there also proved significant.

H. An elderly person who describes herself as in poor health, therefore, might be no less depressed in assisted living(even if her children preferred it)than in a nursing home.A person who had input into where he would move and has had time to adapt to it might do as well in a nursing home as in a small residential care home, other factors being equal.It is an interaction between the person and the place,  not the sort of place in itself,that leads to better or worse experiences."You can't just say,‘Let's put this person in a residential care home instead of a nursing home—she will be much better off,'"Dr.Robison said.What matters, she added, "is a combination of what people bring in with them, and what they find there."

I. Such findings, which run counter to common sense, have surfaced before.In a multi-state study of assisted living, for instance, University of North Carolina researchers found that a host of variables-the facility's type, size or age；whether a chain owned it；how attractive the neighborhood was-had no significant relationship to how the residents fared in terms of illness, mental decline, hospitalizations or mortality.What mattered most was the residents' physical health and mental status.What people were like when they came in had greater consequence than what happened once they were there.

J. As l was considering all this, a press release from a respected research firm crossed my desk, announcing that the five-star rating system that Medicare developed in 2008 to help families compare nursing home quality also has little relationship to how satisfied its residents or their family members are.As a matter of fact, consumers expressed higher satisfaction with the one-star facilities, the lowest rated, than with the five—star ones.(More on this study and the star ratings will appear in a subsequent post.)

K. Before we collectively tear our hair out—how are we supposed to find our way in a landscape this confusing?一here is a thought from Dr.Philip Sloane, a geriatrician(老年病学专家)at the University of North Carolina："In a way,that could be liberating for families."

L. Of course, sons and daughters want to visit the facilities, talk to the administrators and residents and other families, and do everything possible to fulfill their duties.But perhaps they don't have to tum themselves into private investigators or Congressional subcommittees."Families can look a bit more for where the residents are going to be happy,"Dr.Sloane said.And involving the future resident in the process can be very important.

M. We all have our own ideas about what would bring our parents happiness.They have their ideas, too.A friend recently took her mother to visit an expensive assisted living／nursing home near my town.I have seen this place—it is elegant, inside and out.But nobody greeted the daughter and mother when they arrived, though the visit had been planned；nobody introduced them to the other residents.When they had lunch in the dining room, they sat alone at a table.

N. The daughter feared her mother would be ignored there, and so she decided to move her into a more welcoming facility.Based on what is emerging from some of this research, that might have been as rational a way as any to reach a decision.

36.Many people feel guilty when they cannot find a place other than a nursing for their parents.

37.Though it helps for children to investigate care facilities, involving their parents in the decision.making process may prove very important.

38.It is really difficult to tell if assisted living is better than a nursing home.

39.How a resident feels depends on an interaction between themselves and the care facility they live in.

40.The author thinks her friend made a rational decision in choosing a more hospitable place over an apparently elegant assisted living home.

41.The system Medicare developed to rate nursing home quality is of little help to finding a satisfactory place.

42.At first the researchers of the most recent study found residents in assisted living facilities gave higher scores on social interaction.

43.What kind of care facility old people live in may be less important than we think.   

44.The findings of the latest research were similar to an earlier multi—state study of assisted living.

45.A resident's satisfaction with a care facility has much to do with whether they had participated in the decision to move in and how long they had stayed there.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D.You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

  As Artificial Intelligence(AI)becomes increasingly sophisticated, there are growing concerns that robots could become a threat.This danger can be avoided, according to computer science professor Stuart Russell, if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code.
  Russell argues that as robots take on more complicated tasks, it's necessary to translate our morals into AI language.
  For example, if a robot does chores around the house, you wouldn't want it to put the pet cat in the oven to make dinner for the hungry children."You would want that robot preloaded with a good set of values, "said Russell.
  Some robots are already programmed with basic human values.For example, mobile robots have been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans.Obviously there are cultural differences, but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in your personal space, you wouldn't think that's the kind of thing a properly brought—up person would do.
  It will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines, if only we can find a way to set out human values as clear rules.
  Robots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on human behavior.They are dangerous only if programmers are careless.
    The biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to do sufficient testing and they've produced a system that will break some kind of taboo(禁忌).
    One simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with a human when presented with an unusual situation.
  If the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave, it has the opportunity to stop, send out beeps(嘟嘟声), and ask for directions from a human.If we humans aren't quite sure about a decision.We go and ask somebody else.
  The most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe is moral, and how to create a set of ethical rules.But if we come up with an answer,robots could be good for humanity.

46.What does the author say about the threat of robots?
  A.It may constitute a challenge to computer programmers.
  B.It accompanies all machinery involving high technology.
  C.It Can be avoided if human values are translated into their language.
  D.It has become an inevitable peril as technology gets more sophisticated.

47.What would we think of a person who invades our personal space according to the author?
  A.They are aggressive.    
  B.They are outgoing.
  C.They are ignorant.
  D.They are ill-bred.

48.How do robots learn human values?
  A.By interacting with humans in everyday life situations.
  B.By following the daily routines of civilized human beings.
  C.By picking up patterns from massive data on human behavior.
  D.By imitating the behavior of properly brought—up human beings.

49.What will a well—programmed robot do when facing an unusual situation?
  A.Keep a distance from possible dangers.
  B.Stop to seek advice from a human being.
  C.Trigger its built—in alarm system at once.
  D.Do sufficient testing before taking action.

50.What is most difficult to do when we turn human values into a programmable code?
  A.Determine what is moral and ethical.
  B.Design some large—scale experiments.
  C.Set rules for man—machine interaction.
  D.Develop a more sophisticated program.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

  Why do some people live to be older than others?You know the standard explanations：keeping a moderate diet, engaging in regular exercise, etc。But what effect does your personality have on your longevity(长寿)?Do some kinds of personalities lead to longer lives?A new study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society looked at this question by examining the personality characteristics of 246 children of people who had lived to be at least 100.
  The study shows that those living the longest are more outgoing, more active and less, neurotic(神经质的)than other people.Long—living women are also more likely to be sympathetic and cooperative than women with a normal life span.These findings are in agreement with what you would expect from the evolutionary theory：those who like to make friends and help others can gather enough resources to make it through tough times.
  Interestingly,however,other characteristics that you might consider advantageous had no impact on whether study participants were likely to live longer.Those who were more self-disciplined, for instance,were no more likely to live to be very old.Also, being open to new ideas had no relationship to long life, which might explain all those bad-tempered old people who are fixed in their ways.
  Whether you can successfully change your personality as an adult is the subject of a longstanding psychological debate.But the new paper suggests that if you want long life, you should strive to be as outgoing as possible.
  Unfortunately,another recent study shows that your mother's personality may also help determine your longevity.That study looked at nearly 28, 000 Norwegian mothers and found that those moms who were more anxious, depressed and angry were more likely to feed their kids unhealthy diets.Patterns of childhood eating can be hard to break when we're adults, which may mean that kids of depressed moms end up dying younger.
  Personality isn't destiny(命运), and everyone knows that individuals can learn to change.But both studies show that long life isn't just a matter of your physical health but of ,your mental health.

51.The aim of the study in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society is    .
  A.to see whether people's personality affects their life span
  B.to find out if one's lifestyle has any effect on their health
  C.to investigate the role of exercise in living a long life
  D.to examine all the factors contributing to longevity

52.What does the author imply about outgoing and sympathetic people?
  A.They have a good understanding of evolution.
  B.They are better at negotiating an agreement.
  C.They generally appear more resourceful.
  D.They are more likely to get over hardship.

53.What finding of the study might prove somewhat out of our expectation?
  A.Easy—going people can also live a relatively long life.
  B.Personality characteristics that prove advantageous actually vary with times.
  C.Such personality characteristics as self-discipline have no effect on longevity.
  D.Readiness to accept new ideas helps one enjoy longevity.

54.What does the recent study of Norwegian mothers show?
  A.Children's personality characteristics are invariably determined by their mothers·
  B.People with unhealthy eating habits are likely to die sooner.
  C.Mothers' influence on children may last longer than fathers'.
  D.Mothers' negative personality characteristics may affect their children's life spans.

55.What can we learn from the findings of the two new studies?
  A.Anxiety and depression more often than not cut short one's life span.
  B.Longevity results from a combination of mental and physical health.
  C.Personality plays a decisive role in how healthy one is.
  D.Health is in large part related to one's lifestyle.

Ancient Greek Wisdom Inspires Guidelines to Good Life

A.Is it possible to enjoy a peaceful life in a world that is increasingly challenged by threats and uncertainties from wars, terrorism, economic crises and a widespread outbreak of infectious diseases? The answer is yes, according to a new book The 10 Golden Rules."Ancient Wisdom from the Greek Philosophers on Living a Good Life.The book is co-authored by Long Island University's philosophy professor Michael Soupios and economics professor Panos Mourdoukoutas.

B.The wisdom of the ancient Greek philosophers is timeless, says Soupios.The philosophy professor says it is as relevant today as when it was first written many centuries ago.“There is no expiration(失效) date on wisdom.”he says.“There is no shelf life on intelligence.I think that things have become very gloomy these days, lots of misunderstanding, misleading cues, a lot of what the ancients would have called sophistry(诡辩).The nice thing about ancient philosophy as offered by the Greeks is that they tended to see life clear and whole, in a way that we tend not to see life today.”

 Examine your life
C.Soupios, along with his co—author Panos Mourdoukoutas, developed their 10 golden rules by turning to the men behind that philosophy—Aristotle, Socrates, Epictetus and Pythagoras, among others.The first rule—examine your life—is the common thread that runs through the entire book.Soupios says that it is based on Plato's observation that the unexamined life is not worth living.“The Greeks are always concerned about boxing themselves in, in terms of convictions(信念), ”he says.“So take a step back,  switch off the automatic pilot and actually stop and reflect about things like our priorities, our values,  and our relationships.”

    Stop worrying about what you can not control
D.As we begin to examine our life, Soupios says, we come to Rule No.2：Worry only about things that you can control.“The individual who promoted this idea was a Stoic philosopher.His name is Epictetus, ”he says.“And what the Stoics say in general is simply this：There is a larger plan in life.You are not really going to be able to understand all of the dimensions of this plan.You are not going to be able to control the dimensions of this plan.”
E.So, Soupios explains, it is not worth it to waste our physical, intellectual and spiritual energy worrying about things that are beyond our control.“I can not control whether or not l wind up getting the disease swine flu, for example, ”he says.“I mean, there are some cautious steps I can take, but ultimately I can not guarantee myself that.So what Epictetus would say is sitting at home worrying about that would be wrong and wasteful and irrational.You should live your life attempting to identify and control those things which you can genuinely control.''

    Seek true pleasure
F. To have a meaningful, happy life we need friends. But according to Aristotle—a student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great—most relationships don’t qualify as true friendships. “Just because I have a business relationship with an individual and I can profit from that relationship, it does not necessarily mean that this person is my friend,” Soupios says. “Real friendship is when two individuals share the same soul. It is a beautiful and uncharacteristically poetic image that Aristotle offers.”

H.“This was the highest and most desirable form of pleasure and happiness for the ancient Epicureans, ” Soupios says.“This is something that is very much well worth considering here in the modem era.I do not think that we spend nearly enough time trying to concentrate on achieving a sort of calmness, a sort of contentment in a mental and spiritual way,which was identified by these people as the highest form of happiness and pleasure.”

  Do good to others
I.  Other golden rules counsel us to master ourselves, to avoid excess and not to be a prosperous(发迹的) fool.There are also rules dealing with interpersonal relationships：Be a responsible human being and do not do evil things to others.

J. “This is Hesiod, of course, a younger contemporary poet, we believe, with Homer,” Soupios says. “Hesiod offers an idea—which you very often find in some of the world’s great religions, in the Judeo-Christian tradition and in Islam and others—that in some sense, when you hurt another human being, you hurt yourself. That damaging other people in your community and in your life, trashing relationships, results in a kind of self-inflicted (自己招致的) spiritual wound.”

K.Instead, Soupios says, ancient wisdom urges us to do good.Golden Rule No.10 for a good life is that kindness toward others tends to be rewarded.

L.“This is Aesop, the fabulist(寓言家), the man of these charming little tales, often told in terms of animals and animal relationships,” he says.“I think what Aesop was suggesting is that when you offer a good turn to another human being, one can hope that that good deed will come back and sort of pay a profit to you, the doer of the good deed.Even if there is no concrete benefit paid in response to your good deed, at the very least, the doer of the good deed has the opportunity to enjoy a kind of spiritually enlightened moment.”

M.Soupios says following the 10 Golden Rules based on ancient wisdom can guide us to the path of the good life where we stop living as onlookers and become engaged and happier human beings.And that,  he notes, is a life worth living.

36.According to an ancient Greek philosopher,it is impossible for us to understand every aspect of our life.

37.Ancient philosophers saw life in a different light from people of today.

38.Not all your business partners are your soul mates.

39.We can live a peaceful life despite the various challenges of the modem world.

40.The doer of a good deed can feel spiritually rewarded even when they gain no concrete benefits.

41.How to achieve mental calmness and contentment is well worth our consideration today.

42.Michael Soupios suggests that we should stop and think carefully about our priorities in life.

43.Ancient philosophers strongly advise that we do good.

44.The wise teachings of ancient Greek thinkers are timeless, and are applicable to contemporary life.

45.Do harm to others and you do harm to yourself.

 Section C
 Directions：There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A), B., C.and D..You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to50 are based on the following passage.

　　  Attitudes toward new technologies often fall along generational lines. That is, generally, younger people tend to outnumber older people on the front end of a technological shift.
　　It is not always the case, though. When you look at attitudes toward driverless cars, there doesn’t seem to be a clear generational divide. The public overall is split on whether they’d like to use a driverless car. In a study last year, of all people surveyed, 48 percent said they wanted to ride in one, while 50 percent did not.
　　The fact that attitudes toward self-driving cars appear to be so steady across generations suggests how transformative the shift to driverless cars could be. Not everyone wants a driverless car now—and no one can get one yet—but among those who are open to them, every age group is similarly engaged.
　　Actually, this isn’t surprising. Whereas older generations are sometimes reluctant to adopt new technologies, driverless cars promise real value to these age groups in particular. Older adults, especially those with limited mobility or difficulty driving on their own, are one of the classic use-cases for driverless cars.
　　This is especially interesting when you consider that younger people are generally more interested in travel-related technologies than older ones.
　　When it comes to driverless cars, differences in attitude are more pronounced based on factors not related to age. College graduates, for example, are particularly interested in driverless cars compared with those who have less education: 59 percent of college graduates said they would like to use a driverless car compared with 38 percent of those with a high-school diploma or less.
　　Where a person lives matters, too. More people who lived in cities and suburbs said they wanted to try driverless cars than those who lived in rural areas.
　　While there’s reason to believe that interest in self-driving cars is going up across the board, a person’s age will have little to do with how self-driving cars can become mainstream. Once driverless cars are actually available for sale, the early adopters will be the people who can afford to buy them.
46.What happens when a new technology emerges?
  A.It further widens the gap between the old and the young.
  B.It often leads to innovations in other related fields.
  C.It contributes greatly to the advance of society as a whole.
  D.It usually draws different reactions from different age groups.

47.What does the author say about the driverless car?
  A.It does not seem to create a generational divide.
  B.It will not necessarily reduce road accidents.
  C.It may start a revolution in the car industry.
  D.It has given rise to unrealistic expectations.

48.Why does the driverless car appeal to some old people?
A.It saves their energy.
B.It helps with their mobility.
C.It adds to the safety of their travel.
D.It stirs up their interest in life.

49.What is likely to affect one's attitude toward the driverless car?
A.The location of their residence.
B.The field of their special interest.
C.The amount of training they received.
D.The length of their driving experience.

50.Who are likely to be the first to buy the driverless car?
A.The seniors.
B.The educated.
C.The wealthy.
D.The tech fans.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　In agrarian (农业的), pre-industrial Europe, “you’d want to wake up early, start working with the sunrise, have a break to have the largest meal, and then you’d go back to work, ” says Ken Albala, a professor of history at the University of the Pacific. “Later, at 5 or 6, you’d have a smaller supper.”
　　This comfortable cycle, in which the rhythms of the day helped shape the rhythms of the meals, gave rise to the custom of the large midday meal, eaten with the extended family. “Meals are the foundation of the family,” says Carole Counihan, a professor at Millersville University in Pennsylvania, “so there was a very important interconnection between eating together”and strengthening family ties.
　　Since industrialization, maintaining such a slow cultural metabolism has been much harder, with the long midday meal shrinking to whatever could be stuffed into a lunch bucket or bought at a food stand. Certainly, there were benefits. Modern techniques for producing and shipping food led to greater variety and quantity, including a tremendous increase in the amount of animal protein and dairy products available, making us more vigorous than our ancestors.
　　Yet plenty has been lost too, even in cultures that still live to eat. Take Italy. It’s no secret that the Mediterranean diet is healthy, but it was also a joy to prepare and eat. Italians, says Counihan, traditionally began the day with a small meal. The big meal came at around 1 p.m. In between the midday meal and a late, smaller dinner came a small snack. Today, when time zones have less and less meaning, there is little tolerance for offices’ closing for lunch, and worsening traffic in cities means workers can’t make it home and back fast enough anyway. So the formerly small supper after sundown becomes the big meal of the day, the only one at which the family has a chance to get together. “The evening meal carries the full burden that used to be spread over two meals, ”says Counihan.
51.What do we learn from the passage about people in pre—industrial Europe?
  A.They had to work from early morning till late at night.
  B.They were so busy working that they only ate simple meals.
  C.Their daily routine followed the rhythm of the natural cycle.
  D.Their life was much more comfortable than that of today.

52.What does Professor Carole Counihan say about pre-industrial European families eating meals together?
  A.It was helpful to maintaining a nation's tradition.
  B.It brought family members closer to each other.
  C.It was characteristic of the agrarian culture.
  D.It enabled families to save a lot of money.

53.What does“cultural metabolism”(Line l, Para.3)refer to?
  A.Evolutionary adaptation.   
  B.Changes in lifestyle.    
  C.Social progress.
  D.Pace of life.

54.What does the author think of the food people eat today?
  A.Its quality is usually guaranteed.
  B.It is varied, abundant and nutritious.
  C.It is more costly than what our ancestors ate.
  D.Its production depends too much on technology.

55.What does the author say about Italians of the old days?
  A.They enjoyed cooking as well as eating.    
  B.They ate a big dinner late in the evening.    
  C.They ate three meals regularly every day.
  D.They were expert at cooking meals.

    Contrary to popular belief,older people generally do not want to live with their children.Moreover,most adult children  26  every bit as much care and support to their aging parents as was the case in the“good old days”,and most older people do not feel  27  .
    About 80％of people 65 years and older have living children,and about 90％of them have  28 contact with their children.About 75％of elderly parents who don’t go to nursing homes live within 30 minutes of at least one of their children.
    However,29 having contact with children does not guarantee happiness in old age.In fact.some research has found that people who are most involved with their families have the lowest spirits.This research may be 30,however,as ill health often makes older people more 31 and thereby increases contact with family members.So it is more likely that poor health,not just family involvement,  32 spirits.
　　Increasingly,researchers have begun to look at the quality of relationships,rather than at the frequency of contact,between the elderly and their children.If parents and children share interests and values and agree on childrearing practices and religious 33,they are likely to enjoy each other’s company.Disagreements on such matters can 34 cause problems.If parents are angered by their daughter’s divorce,dislike her new husband.and disapprove of how she is raising their grandchildren, 35 are that they are not going to enjoy her visits.

Could Food Shortages Bring Down Civilization?

A.For many years I have studied global agricultural,population,environmental and economic trends and their interactions.The combined effects of those trends and the political tensions they generate point to the breakdown of governments and societies.Yet I,too,have resisted the idea that food shortages could bring down not only individual governments but also our global civilization.

B.I can no longer ignore that risk.Our continuing failure to deal with the environmental declines that are undermining the world food economy forces me to conclude that such a collapse is possible.

C.As demand for food rises faster than supplies are growing,the resulting food-price inflation puts severe stress on the governments of many countries.Unable to buy grain or grow their own,hungry people take to the streets.Indeed,even before the steep climb in grain prices in 2008, the number of failing states was expanding.If the food situation continues to worsen,entire nations will break down at an ever increasing rate.In the 20th century the main threat to international security was superpower conflict；today it is failing states.

D.States fail when national governments can no longer provide personal security,food security and basic social services such as education and health care.When governments lose their control on power law and order begin to disintegrate.After a point,countries can become so dangerous that food relief workers are no longer safe and their programs are halted. Failing states are of international concern because they are a source of terrorists, drugs, weapons and refugees (难民) threatening political stability everywhere.

E.The surge in world grain prices in 2007 and 2008—and the threat they pose to food security-has a different,more troubling quality than the increases of the past.During the second half of the 20th century,grain prices rose dramatically several times.In 1972,for instance,the Soviets,recognizing their poor harvest early,quietly cornered the world wheat market.As a result.wheat prices elsewhere more than doubled,pulling rice and corn prices up with them.But this and other price shocks were event-driven-drought in the Soviet Union, crop-shrinking heat in the U.S.Corn Belt.And the rises were short-lived：prices typically returned to normal with the next harvest.

F.In contrast,the recent surge in world grain prices is trend-driven, making it unlikely to reverse without a reversal in the trends themselves.On the demand side, those trends include the ongoing addition of more than 70 million people a year,a growing number of people wanting to move up the food chain to consume highly grain-intensive meat products,and the massive diversion(转向)of U.S.grain to the production of bio-fuel.

G.As incomes rise among low-income consumers,the potential for further grain consumption is huge.But that potential pales beside the never-ending demand for crop-based fuels.A fourth of this year’s U.S. grain harvest will go to fuel cars.

H. What about supply?The three environmental trends-the shortage of fresh water, the loss of topsoil and the rising temperatures-are making it increasingly hard to expand the world’s grain supply fast enough to keep up with demand.Of all those trends.however,the spread of water shortages poses the most immediate threat. The biggest challenge here is in irrigation.which consumes 70％of the world’s fresh water.Millions of irrigation wells in many countries are now pumping water out of underground sources faster than rainfall can refill them.The result is falling water tables (地下水位) in countries with half the world’s people,including the three big grain producers—China, India and the U.S.

I.As water tables have fallen and irrigation wells have gone dry,China’s wheat crop,the world’s largest,has declined by 8％since it peaked at 123 million tons in 1997. But water shortages are even more worrying in India.Millions of irrigation wells have significantly lowered water tables in almost every state.

J.As the world’s food security falls to pieces, individual countries acting in their own self-interest are actually worsening the troubles of many.The trend began in 2007,when leading wheat-exporting countries such as Russia and Argentina limited or banned their exports, in hopes of increasing local food supplies and thereby bringing down domestic food prices.Vietnam banned its exports for several months for the same reason.Such moves may eliminate the fears of those living in the exporting countries,but they are creating panic in importing countries that must rely on what is then left for export.

K.In response to those restrictions,grain-importing countries are trying to nail down long-term trade agreements that would lock up future grain supplies.Food-import anxiety is even leading to new efforts by food-importing countries to buy or lease farmland in other countries.In spite of such temporary measures,soaring food prices and spreading hunger in many other countries are beginning to break down the social order.

L.Since the current world food shortage is trend-driven,the environmental trends that cause it must be reversed.We must cut carbon emissions by 80％from their 2006 levels by 2020, stabilize the world’s population at eight billion by 2040,completely remove poverty, and restore forests and soils. There is nothing new about the four objectives.Indeed,we have made substantial progress in some parts of the world on at least one of these-the distribution of family-planning services and the associated shift to smaller families.

M.For many in the development community,the four objectives were seen as positive,promoting development as long as they did not cost too much.Others saw them as politically correct and morally appropriate.Now a third and far more significant motivation presents itself: meeting these goals may be necessary to prevent the collapse of our civilization.Yet the cost we project for saving civilization would amount to less than $200 billion a year,1/6 of current global military spending.In effect,our plan is the new security budget.

36.The more recent steep climb in grain prices partly results from the fact that more and more people want to consume meat products.

37.Social order is breaking down in many countries because of food shortages.

38.Rather than superpower conflict,countries unable to cope with food shortages now constitute the main threat to world security.

39.Some parts of the world have seen successful implementation of family planning.

40.The author has come to agree that food shortages could ultimately lead to the collapse of world civilization.

41.Increasing water shortages prove to be the biggest obstacle to boosting the world’s grain production.

42.The cost for saving our civilization would be considerably less than the world’s current military spending.

43.To lower domestic food prices,some countries limited or stopped their grain exports.

44.Environmental problems must be solved to ease the current global food shortage.

45.A quarter of this year’s American grain harvest will be used to produce bio-fuel for cars.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D .You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　  Declining mental function is often seen as a problem of old age, but certain aspects of brain function actually begin their decline in young adulthood, a new study suggests.
　　The study, which followed more than 2,000 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 60, found that certain mental functions-including measures of abstract reasoning, mental speed and puzzle-solving-started to dull as early as age 27.
　　Dips in memory, meanwhile, generally became apparent around age 37.
　　On the other hand, indicators of a person’s accumulated knowledge—like performance on tests of vocabulary and general knowledge—kept improving with age, according to findings published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging.
　　The results do not mean that young adults need to start worrying about their memories. Most people’s minds function at a high level even in their later years, according to researcher Timothy Salthouse.
　　“These patterns suggest that some types of mental flexibility decrease relatively early in adulthood, but that the amount of knowledge one has, and the effectiveness of integrating it with one’s abilities, may increase throughout all of adulthood if there are no diseases,” Salthouse said in a news release.
　　The study included healthy, educated adults who took standard tests of memory, reasoning and perception at the outset and at some point over the next seven years.
　　The tests are designed to detect subtle (细微的) changes in mental function, and involve solving puzzles, recalling words and details from stories, and identifying patterns in collections of letters and symbols.
　　In general, Salthouse and his colleagues found, certain aspects of cognition (认知能力) generally started to decline in the late 20s to 30s.
　　The findings shed light on normal age—related changes in mental function, which could aid in understanding the process of dementia (痴呆), according to the researchers.
　　“By following individuals over time,” Salthouse said, “we gain insight in cognition changes, and may possibly discover ways to slow the rate of decline.”
　　The researchers are currently analyzing the study participants, health and lifestyle to see which factors might influence age-related cognitive changes.
 
46.What is the common view of mental function?
  A.It varies from person to person.    
  B.It weakens in one’s later years.
  C.It gradually expands with age.
  D.It indicates one’s health condition

47.What does the new study find about mental functions?
    A.Some diseases inevitably lead to their decline.
    B.They reach a peak at the age of 20 for most people.
    C.They are closely related to physical and mental exercise.
　　D.Some of them begin to decline when people are still young.
　　
48.What does Timothy Salthouse say about people’s minds in most cases?
  A.They tend to decline in people’s later years.  
  B.Their flexibility determines one’s abilities.
  C.They function quite well even in old age.
  D.Their functioning is still a puzzle to be solved.

49.Although people’s minds may function less flexibly as they age,they    .
  A.may be better at solving puzzles
  B.can memorize things with more ease
  C.may have greater facility in abstract reasoning
  D.can put what they have learnt into more effective use

50.According to Salthouse,their study may help us    .
  A.find ways to slow down our mental decline
  B.find ways to boost our memories
  C.understand the complex process of mental functioning
  D.understand the relation between physical and mental health

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

  The most important thing in the news last week was the rising discussion in Nashville about the educational needs of children.The shorthand (简写) educators use for this is“pre-K”-meaning instruction before kindergarten-and the big idea is to prepare 4-year-oldsandevenyoungerkidstobe ready to succeed on their K-12journey.
  But it gets complicated.The concept has multiple forms,and scholars and policymakers argue about the shape,scope and cost of the ideal program.
  The federal Head Start program, launched 50 years ago, has served more than 30 million children. It was based on concepts developed at Vanderbilt University’s Peabody College by Susan Gray,the legendary pioneer in early childhood education research.
  A new Peabody study of the Tennessee Voluntary Pre-K program reports that pre-K works, but the gains are not sustained through the third grade.It seems to me this highlights quality issues in elementary schools more than pre-K,and indicates longer-term success must connect pre-K with all the other issues related to educating a child.
  Pre-K is controversial.Some critics say it is a luxury and shouldn’t be free to families able to Pay.Pre-K advocates insist it is proven and will succeed if integrated with the rest of the child’s schooling.I lean toward the latter view.
  This is,in any case, the right conversation to be having now as Mayor Megan Barry takes office.She was the first candidate to speak out for strong pre-K programming.The important thing is for all of us to keep in mind the real goal and the longer, bigger picture.
  The weight of the evidence is on the side of pre-K that early intervention(干预)works.What government has not yet found is the political will to put that understanding into full practice with a sequence of smart schooling that provides the early foundation.
  For this purpose,our schools need both the talent and the organization to educate each child who arrives at the schoolhouse door.Some show up ready,but many do not at this critical time when young brains are developing rapidly.

51.What does the author say about pre-kindergarten education?
  A.It should cater to the needs of individual children.
  B.It is essential to a person’s future academic Success.
  C.Scholars and policymakers have different opinions about it.
  D.Parents regard it as the first phase of children’s development.

52.What does the new Peabody study find?
  A.Pre-K achievements usually do not last long.
  B.The third grade marks a new phase of learning.
  C.The third grade is critical to children’s development.
  D.Quality has not been the top concern of pre-K programs.

A.When it is accessible to kids of all families.
B.When it is made part of kids’ education.
C.When it is no longer considered a luxury.
D.When it is made fun and enjoyable to kids.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　Many men and women have long bought into the idea that there are “male” and “female” brains, believing that explains just about every difference between the sexes. A new study   26   that belief,questioning whether brains really can be distinguished by gender.
　　In the study, Tel Aviv University researchers   27   for sex differences throughout the entire human brain.
　　And what did they find? Not much. Rather than offer evidence for28brains as “male” or “female,” research shows that brains fall into a wide range, with most people falling right in the middle.
　　Daphna Joel, who led the study, said her research found that while there are some gender-based   29  , many different types of brain can’t always be distinguished by gender.
　　While the “average” male and “average” female brains were   30   different, you couldn’t tell it by looking at individual brain scans. Only a small   31   of people had “all-male” or “all-female” characteristics.
　　Larry Cahill, an American neuroscientist ( 神经科学家), said the study is an important addition to a growing body of research questioning   32   beliefs about gender and brain function. But he cautioned against concluding from this study that all brains are the same,   33   of gender.
　　“There’s a mountain of evidence   34   the importance of sex influences at all levels of brain function,” he told The Seattle Times.
　　If anything, he said, the study   35   that gender plays a very important role in the brain—“even when we are not clear exactly how.”

Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs.Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived.You may choose a paragraph more than once.Each paragraph is marked with a letter.Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Can Burglars Jam Your Wireless Security System?

A.Any product that promises to protect your home deserves careful examination.So it isn't surprising thatyou'11 find plenty of strong opinions about the potential vulnerabilities of popular home—security systems.

B.The most likely type of burglary(人室盗窃)by far is the unsophisticated crime of opportunity,usually involving a broken window or some forced entry.According to the FB1.crimes like these accounted for roughly two.thirds of all household burglaries in the US in 2013.The wide majority of the rest were illegal.unforced entries that resulted from something like a window being left open.The odds of a criminal using technical means to bypass a security system are so small that the FBI doesn't even track those statistics.

C.One of the main theoretical home—security concerns is whether or not a given system is vulnerable to being blocked from working altogether.With wired setups,the fear is that a burglar(人室盗贼)might be able to shut your system down simply by cutting the right cable.With a wireless setup.you stick battery—powered sensors up around your home that keep an eye on windows。doors,motion,and more.If they detect something wrong while the system is armed.they'll transmit a wireless a left signal to a base station that will then raise the alarm.That approach will eliminate most cord—cutting concerns--but what about their wireless equivalent,jamming?with the fight device tuned to the fight frequency,what's to stop a thief from jamming your setup and blocking that alert signal from ever reaching the base station?

D.Jamming concerns are nothing new,and they're not unique to security systems.Any device that's built to receive a wireless signal at a specific frequency can be overwhelmed by a stronger signal coming in on the same frequency.For comparison.1et's say you wanted to“jam”a conversation between two people--all you'd need to do is yell in the listener's ear.

E) Security devices are required to list the frequencies they broadcast on—mat means that a potential thief can find what they need to know with minimal Googling.They will.however.need to know what system they're looking for.If you have a sign in your yard declaring what setup you use, that'd point them in the right direction,though at that point,we're talking about a highly targeted,semi—sophisticated attack,and not the sort of forced—entry attack that makes up the majority of burglaries.It's easier to find and acquire jamming equipment for some frequencies than it is for others.

F)Wireless security providers will often take steps to help combat the threat of jamming attacks. SimpliSafe,winner of our Editors'Choice distinction.utilizes a special system that's capable of separating incidental RF interference from targeted jamming attacks.When the system thinks it's being jammed,it'll notify you via push alert(推送警报).From there,it's up to you to sound the alarm manually.

G)SimpliSafe was singled out in one recent article on jamming,complete with a video showing the entire system being effectively bypassed with hand held jamming equipment.After taking appropriate measures to contain the RF interference to our test lab,we tested the attack out for ourselves,and were able to verify that it's possible with the right equipment.However.we also verified that SimpliSafe's anti-jamming system works.It caught us in the act,sent an alert to my smart phone,and also listed our RF interference on the system's event log.The team behind the article and video in question make no mention of the system,or whether or not it detected them.

H)We like the unique nature of that software.It means that a thief likely wouldn't be able to Google how the system works.then figure out a way around it.Even if they could,SimpliSafe claims that its system is always evolving,and that it varies slightly from system to system,which means there wouldn't be a universal magic formula for cracking it.Other systems also seem confident on the subject of jamming.The team at Front point addresses the issue in a blog on its site,citing their own jam protection software and claiming that there aren't any documented cases of a successful jam attack since the company began offering wireless security sensors in the l980s.

I)Jamming attacks are absolutely possible.As said before.with the fight equipment and the right know—how,it's possible to jam any wireless transmission.But how probable is it that someone will successfully jam their way into your home and steal your stuff?

J)Let's imagine that you live in a small home with a wireless security setup that offers a functional anti—jamming system.First,a thief is going to need to target your home,specifically.Then,he's going to need to know the technical details of your system and acquire the specific equipment necessary for jamming your specific setup.Presumably,you keep your doors locked at night and while you're away,so the thief will still need to break in.That means defeating the lock somehow,or breaking a window.He'11 need to be jamming you at this point,as a broken window or opened door would normally release the alarm.S0,too,would the motion detectors in your home,so the thief will need to continue jamming once he's inside and searching for things to steal.However.he'11 need to do so without tripping the anti-jamming system,the details of which he almost certainly does not have access to.

K)At the end of the day,these kinds of systems are primarily designed to protect against the sort of opportunistic smash—and—grab attack that makes up the majority of burglaries.They're also only a single layer in what should ideally be a many—sided approach to securing your home,one that includes commonsense things like sound locks and proper exterior lighting at night.No system is impenetrable,and none can promise to eliminate the worst case completely.Every one of them has vulnerabilities that a knowledgeable thief could theoretically exploit.A good system is one that keeps that worst—case setting as improbable as possible while also offering strong protection in the event of a less-extraordinary attack.

36.It is possible for burglars to make jamming attacks with the necessary equipment and skill.

37.Interfering with a wireless security system is similar to interfering with a conversation.

38.A burglar has to continuously jam the wireless security device to avoid triggering the alarm,both inside and outside the house.

39.SimpliSafe provides devices that are able to distinguish incidental radio interference from targeted jamming attacks.

40.Only a very small proportion of burglaries are committed by technical means.

41.It is difficult to crack SimpliSafe as its system keeps changing.

42.Wireless devices will transmit signals so as to activate the alarm once something wrong is detected.

43.Different measures should be taken to protect one's home from burglary in addition to the wireless security system.

44.SimpliSafe's device can send a warning to the house owner's cellphone.

45.Burglars can easily get a security device's frequency by Internet search.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A,B,C and D.You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based oil the following passage.

　　As a person who writes about food and drink for a living。I couldn't tell you the first thing about Bill Perry or whether the beers he sells are that great.But I can tell you that I like this guy.That's because he plans to ban tipping in favor of paying his servers an actual living wage
　　I hate tipping.
　　I hate it because it's an obligation disguised as an option.I hate it for the post—dinner math it requires of me.But mostly.I hate tipping because I believe l would be in a better place if pay decisions regarding employees were simply left up to their employers,as is the custom in virtually every other industry.
　　 Most of you probably think that you hate tipping,too.Research suggests otherwise.You actually love tipping!You like to feel that you have a voice in how much money your server makes.No matter how the math works out,you persistently view restaurants with voluntary tipping systems as being a better value,which makes it extremely difficult for restaurants and bars to do away with the tipping system.
　　 One argument that you tend to hear a lot from the pr0—tipping crowd seems logical enough：the service is better when waiters depend on tips,presumably because they see a benefit to successfully veiling their contempt for you.Well.if this were true.we would all be slipping a few l00-dollar bills to our doctors on-the way out their doors,too.But as it turns out,waiters see only a tiny bump in tips when they do an exceptional job compared to a passable one.Waiters,keen observers of humanity that they are.are catching on to this；in one poll,a full 30％said they didn't believe the job they did had any impact on the tips they received.
　　 So come on,folks：get on board with ditching the outdated tip system.Pay a little more up front for your beer or burger.Support Bill Perry's pub,and any other bar or restaurant that doesn't ask you to do drunken math.
　　
46.What can we learn about Bill Perry from the passage?
A.He runs a pub that serves excellent beer.
B.He intends to get rid of the tipping practice.
C.He gives his staff a considerable sum for tips.
D.He lives comfortably without getting any tips.

47.What is the main reason why the author hates tipping?
A. It sets a bad example for other industries.
B. It adds to the burden of ordinary customers.
C. It forces the customer to compensate the waiter.
D.It poses a great challenge for customers to do math.

48.Why do many people love tipping according to the author?
A.They help improve the quality of the restaurants they dine in.
B. They believe waiters deserve such rewards for good service.
C.They want to preserve a wonderful tradition of the industry.
D.They can have some say in how much their servers earn.

49.What have some waiters come to realize according to a survey?
A.Service quality has little effect on tip size.
B. It is in human nature to try to save on tips.
C.Tips make it more difficult to please customers.
D.Tips benefit the boss rather than the employees.

50.What does the author argue for in the passage?
A.Restaurants should calculate the tips for customers.
B.Customers should pay more tips to help improve service.
C.Waiters deserve better than just relying on tips for a living.
D.Waiters should be paid by employers instead of customers.

Passage Two
Questions 5l to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　In the past,falling oil prices have given a boost to the world economy,but recent forecasts for global growth have been toned down.even as oil prices sink lower and lower.Does that mean the link between lower oil prices and growth has weakened?
　　Some experts say there are still good reasons to believe cheap oil should heat up the world economy.Consumers have more money in their pockets when they're paying less at the pump.They spend that money off other things,which stimulates the economy.
　　The biggest gains go to countries that import most of their oil like China.Japan.and India.But doesn't the extra money in the pockets of those countries' consumers mean an equal loss in oil-producing countries, canceling out the gains? Not necessarily, say economic researcher Sara Johnson. "Many oil producers built up huge reserve funds when prices were high, so when prices fall they will draw on their reserves to support government spending and subsidies (补贴) for their consumers.
　　But not all oil producers have big reserves. In Venezuela, collapsing oil prices have sent its economy into free-fall.
　　Economist Carl Weinberg believes the negative effects of plunging oil prices are overwhelming the positive effects of cheaper oil. The implication is a sharp decline in global trade, which has plunged partly because oil-producing nations can't afford to import as much as they used to.
　　Sara Johnson acknowledges that the global economic benefit from a fall in oil prices today is likely lower than it was in the past. One reason is that more countries are big oil producers now, so the nations suffering from the price drop account for a larger share of the global economy.
　　Consumers, in the U.S. at least, are acting cautiously with the savings they're getting at the gas pump, as the memory of the recent great recession is still fresh in their mind. And a number of oil-producing countries are trimming their gasoline subsidies and raising taxes, so the net savings for global consumers is not as big as the oil price plunge might suggest.

51. What does the author mainly discuss in the passage?
A. The reasons behind the plunge of oil prices.
B. Possible ways to stimulate the global economy.
C. The impact of chape oil on global economic growth.
D. The effect of falling oil prices on consumer spending.

52. Why do some experts believe cheap oil will stimulate the global economy?
A. Manufacturers can produce consumer goods at a much lower cost.
B. Lower oil prices have always given a big boost to the global economy.
C. Oil prices may rise or fall but economic laws are not subject to change.
D. Consumers will spend their savings from cheap oil on other commodities.

53. What happens in many oil-exporting countries when oil prices go down?
A. They suspend import of necessities from overseas.
B. They reduce production drastically to boost oil prices.
C. They use their money reserves to back up consumption.
D. They try to stop their economy from going into free-fall.

54. How does Carl Weinberg view the current oil price plunge?
A. It is one that has seen no parallel in economic history.
B. Its negative effects more than cancel out its positive effects.
C. It still has a chance to give rise to a boom in the global economy.
D. Its effects on the global economy go against existing economic laws.

55. Why haven't falling oil prices boosted the global economy as they did before?
A. People are not spending all the money they save on gas.
B. The global economy is likely to undergo another recession.
C. Oil importers account for a larger portion of the global economy.
D. People the world over are afraid of a further plunge in oil prices.

The Secret to Raising Smart Kids

A) I first began to investigate the basis of human motivation--and how people persevere after setbacks--as a psychology graduate student at Yale University in the 1960s. Animal experiments by psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania had shown that after repeated failures, most animals conclude that a situation is hopeless and beyond their control. After such an experience an animal often remains passive even when it can effect change--a state they called learned helplessness.

B) People can learn to be helpless, too. Why do some students give up when they encounter difficulty,whereas others who are no more skilled continue to strive and learn? One answer, I soon discovered, lay in people's beliefs about why they had failed.

C) In particular, attributing poor performance to a lack of ability depresses motivation more than does the belief that lack of effort is to blame. When I told a group of school children who displayed helpless behavior that a lack of effort led to their mistakes in math, they learned to keep trying when the problems got tough. Another group of helpless children who were simply rewarded for their success on easier problems did not improve their ability to solve hard math problems. These experiments indicated that a focus on effort can help resolve helplessness and generate success.

D) Later, I developed a broader theory of what separates the two general classes of learners--helpless versus mastery-oriented. I realized these different types of students not only explain their failures differently, but they also hold different "theories" of intelligence.The helpless ones believe intelligence is a fixed characteristic: you have only a certain amount, and that's that. I call this a"fixed mind-set (思维模式). " Mistakes crack their self-confidence because they attribute errors to a lack of ability, which they feel powerless to change. They avoid challenges because challenges make mistakes more likely. The mastery-oriented children, on the other hand, think intelligence is not fixed and can be developed through education and hard work. Such children believe challenges are energizing rather than intimidating (令人生畏); they offer opportunities to learn. Students with such a growth mind-set were destined (注定) for greater academic success and were quite likely to outperform their counterparts.

E) We validated these expectations in a study in which two other psychologists and I monitored 373students for two years during the transition to junior high school, when the work gets more difficult and the grading more strict, to determine how their mind-sets might affect their math grades. At the beginning of seventh grade, we assessed the students' mind-sets by asking them to agree or disagree with statements such as "Your intelligence is something very basic about you that you can't really change. " We then assessed their beliefs about other aspects of learning and looked to see what happened to their grades.

F) As predicted, the students with a growth mind-set felt that learning was a more important goal than getting good grades. In addition, they held hard work in high regard. They understood that even geniuses have to work hard. Confronted by a setback such as a disappointing test grade, students with a growth mind-set said they would study harder or try a different strategy. The students who held a fixed mind-set, however, were concerned about looking smart with less regard for learning.They had negative views of effort, believing that having to work hard was a sign of low ability.They thought that a person with talent or intelligence did not need to work hard to do well.Attributing a bad grade to their own lack of ability, those with a fixed mind-set said that they would study less in the future, try never to take that subject again and consider cheating on future tests.

G) Such different outlooks had a dramatic impact on performance. At the start of junior high, the math achievement test scores of the students with a growth mind-set were comparable to those of students who displayed a fixed mind-set. But as the work became more difficult, the students with a growth mind-set showed greater persistence. As a result, their math grades overtook those of the other students by the end of the first semester--and the gap between the two groups continued to widen during the two years we followed them.

H) A fixed mind-set can also hinder communication and progress in the workplace and discourage or ignore constructive criticism and advice. Research shows that managers who have a fixed mind-set are less likely to seek or welcome feedback from their employees than are managers with a growth mind-set.

I) How do we transmit a growth mind-set to our children? One way is by telling stories about achievements that result from hard work. For instance, talking about mathematical geniuses who were more or less born that way puts students in a fixed mind-set, but descriptions of great mathematicians who fell in love with math and developed amazing skills produce a growth mind-set.

J) In addition, parents and teachers can help children by providing explicit instruction regarding the mind as a learning machine. I designed an eight-session workshop for 91 students whose math grades were declining in their first year of junior high.Forty-eight of the students received instruction in study skills only, whereas the others attended a combination of study skills sessions and classes in which they learned about the growth mind-set and how to apply it to schoolwork. In the growth mind-set classes, students read and discussed an article entitled "You Can Grow Your Brain. " They were taught that the brain is like a muscle that gets stronger with use and that learning prompts the brain to grow new connections. From such instruction, many students began to see themselves as agents of their own brain development. Despite being unaware that there were two types of instruction, teachers reported significant motivational changes in 27% of the children in the growth mind-set workshop as compared with only 9% of students in the control group.

K) Research is converging (汇聚) on the conclusion that great accomplishment and even genius is typically the result of years of passion and dedication and not something that flows naturally from a gift.

36. The author's experiment shows that students with a fixed mind-set believe having to work hard is an indication of low ability.

37. Focusing on effort is effective in helping children overcome frustration and achieve success.

38. We can cultivate a growth mind-set in children by telling success stories that emphasize hard work and love of learning.

39. Students' belief about the cause of their failure explains their attitude toward setbacks.

40. In the author's experiment, students with a growth mind-set showed greater perseverance in solving difficult math problems.

41. The author conducted an experiment to find out about the influence of students' mind-sets on math learning.

42. After failing again and again, most animals give up hope.

43. Informing students about the brain as a learning machine is a good strategy to enhance their motivation for learning.

44. People with a fixed mind-set believe that one's intelligence is unchangeable.

45. In the workplace, feedback may not be so welcome to managers with a fixed mind-set.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A., B., C. And D . You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　"Sugar, alcohol and tobacco," economist Adam Smith once wrote," are commodities which are nowhere necessaries of life, which have become objects of almost universal consumption, and which are, therefore, extremely popular subjects of taxation. "
　　Two and a haft centuries on, most countries impose some sort of tax on alcohol and tobacco. With surging obesity levels putting increasing strain on public health systems, governments around the world have begun to toy with the idea of taxing sugar as well.
　　Whether such taxes work is a matter of debate. A preliminary review of Mexico's taxation found a fall in purchases of taxed drinks as well as a rise in sales of untaxed and healthier drinks. By contrast,a Danish tax on foods high in fats was abandoned a year after its introduction, amid claims that consumers were avoiding it by crossing the border to Germany to satisfy their desire for cheaper, fattier fare.
　　The food industry has, in general, been firmly opposed to such direct government action.Nonetheless, the renewed focus on waistlines means that industry groups are under pressure to demonstrate their products are healthy as well as tasty.
　　Over the past three decades, the industry has made some efforts to improve the quality of its offerings. For example, some drink manufacturers have cut the amount of sugar in their beverages.
　　Many of the reductions over the past 30 years have been achieved either by reducing the amount of sugar, salt or fat in a product, or by finding an alternative ingredient. More recently, however, some companies have been investing money in a more ambitious undertaking: learning how to adjust the fundamental make-up of the food they sell. For example, having salt on the outside, but none on the inside, reduces the salt content without changing the taste.
　　While reformulating recipes ( 配方) is one way to improve public health, it should be part of a multi-sided approach. The key is to remember that there is not just one solution. To deal with obesity,a mixture of approaches--including reformulation, taxation and adjusting portion sizes--will be needed. There is no silver bullet.

46. What did Adam Smith say about sugar, alcohol and .tobacco?
A. They were profitable to manufacture.
B. They were in ever-increasing demand.
C. They were subject to taxation almost everywhere.
D. They were no longer considered necessities of life.

47. Why have many countries started to consider taxing sugar?
A. They are under growing pressure to balance their national budgets.
B. They find it ever harder to cope with sugar-induced health problems.
C. The practice of taxing alcohol and tobacco has proved both popular and profitable.
D. The sugar industry is overtaking alcohol and tobacco business in generating profits.

48. What do we learn about Danish taxation on fat-rich foods?
A. It did not work out as well as was expected.
B. It gave rise to a lot of problems on the border.
C. It could not succeed without German cooperation.
D. It met with firm opposition from the food industry.

49. What is the more recent effort by food companies to make foods and drinks both healthy and tasty?
A. Replacing sugar or salt with alternative ingredients.
B. Setting a limit on the amount of sugar or salt in their products.
C. Investing in research to find ways to adapt to consumers' needs.
D. Adjusting the physical composition of their products.

50. What does the author mean by saying, at the end of the passage, "There is no silver bullet" ( Line 4, Para.7)?
A. There is no single easy quick solution to the problem.
B. There is no hope of success without public cooperation.
C. There is no hurry in finding ways to solve the obesity problem.
D. There is no effective way to reduce people's sugar consumption.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　You may have heard some of the fashion industry horror stories: models eating tissues or cotton balls to hold off hunger, and models collapsing from hunger-induced heart attacks just seconds after they step off the runway.
　　Excessively skinny models have been a point of controversy for decades, and two researchers say a model's body mass should be a workplace health and safety issue. In an editorial released Monday in the American Journal of Public Health, Katherine Record and Bryn Austin made their case for government regulation of the fashion industry.
　　The average international runway model has a body mass index (BMI) under 16--low enough to indicate starvation by the World Health Organization's standard. And Record and Austin are worried not just about the models themselves, but about the vast number of girls and women their images influence.
　　"Especially girls and teens," says Record. "Seventy percent of girls aged 10 to 18 report that they define perfect body image based on what they see in magazines. " That's especially worrying, she says,given that anorexia (厌食症) results in more deaths than does any other mental illness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
　　It's commonly known that certain diseases are linked with occupations like lung disease in coal miners. Professional fashion models are particularly vulnerable to eating disorders resulting from occupational demands to maintain extreme thinness.
　　Record's suggestion is to prohibit agents from hiring models with a BMI below 18.
　　In April, France passed a law setting lower limits for a model's weight. Agents and fashion houses who hire models with a BMI under 18 could pay $ 82,000 in fines and spend up to 6 months in jail.Regulating the fashion industry in the United States won't be easy, Record says. But with the new rules in France, U.S. support could make a difference. "A designer can't survive without participating in Paris Fashion Week", she says, adding," Our argument is that the same would be true of New York Fashion Week. "

51. What do Record and Austin say about fashion models' body mass?
A. It has caused needless controversy.
B. It is but a matter of personal taste.
C. It is the focus of the modeling business.
D. It affects models' health and safety.

52. What are Record and Austin advocating in the Monday editorial?
A. A change in the public's view of female beauty.
B. Government legislation about models' weight.
C. Elimination of forced weight loss by models.
D. Prohibition of models eating non-food stuff.

53. Why are Record and Austin especially worried about the low body mass index of models?
A. It contributes to many mental illnesses.
B. It defines the future of the fashion industry.
C. It has great influence on numerous girls and women.
D. It keeps many otherwise qualified women off the runway.

54. What do we learn about France's fashion industry?
A. It has difficulty hiring models. 
B. It has now a new law to follow.
C. It allows girls under 18 on the runway.
D. It has overtaken that of the United States.

55. What does Record expect of New York Fashion Week?
A. It will create a completely new set of rules. 
B. It will do better than Paris Fashion Week.
C. It will differ from Paris Fashion Week.
D. It will have models with a higher BMI.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　Many men and women have long bought into the idea that there are "male" and "female" brains,believing that explains just about every difference between the sexes. A new study   26   that belief,questioning whether brains really can be distinguished by gender.
　　In the study, Tel Aviv University researchers  27  for sex differences throughout the entire human brain.
　　And what did they find? Not much. Rather than offer evidence for28brains as "male" or"female," research shows that brains fall into a wide range, with most people falling right in the middle.
　　Daphna Joel, who led the study, said her research found that while there are some gender-based  29 , many different types of brain can't always be distinguished by gender.
　　While the "average" male and "average" female brains were30different, you couldn't tell it by looking at individual brain scans. Only a small31of people had "all-male" or "all-female"characteristics.
　　Larry Cahill, an American neuroscientist ( 神经科学家), said the study is an important addition to a growing body of research questioning32beliefs about gender and brain function. But he cautioned against concluding from this study that all brains are the same,33of gender.
　　"There's a mountain of evidence34the importance of sex influences at all levels of brain function," he told The Seattle Times.
　　If anything, he said, the study35that gender plays a very important role in the brain--" even when we are not clear exactly how. "

Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs.Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived.You may choose a paragraph more than once.Each paragraph is marked with a letter.Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

When Work Becomes a Game

A) What motivates employees to do their jobs well? Competition with coworkers, for some. The promise of rewards, for others. Pure enjoyment of problem-solving, for a lucky few.

B) Increasingly, companies are tapping into these desires directly through what has come to be known as "gamification" : essentially, turning work into a game. "Gamification is about understanding what it is that makes games engaging and what game designers do to create a great experience in games, and taking those learnings and applying them to other contexts such as the workplace and education," explains Kevin Werbach, a gamification expert who teaches at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States.

C) It might mean monitoring employee productivity on a digital leader board and offering prizes to the winner, or giving employees digital badges or stars for completing certain activities. It could also mean training employees how to do their jobs through video game platforms. Companies from Google to L'Oréalto IBM to Wells Fargo are known to use some degree of gamification in their workplaces. And more and more companies are joining them. A recent report suggests that the global gamification market will grow from $1.65 billion in 2015 to $11.1 billion by 2020.

D) The concept of gamification is not entirely new, Werbach says. Companies, marketers and teachers have long looked for fun ways to engage people's reward-seeking or competitive spirits. Cracker Jacks has been "gamifying" its snack food by putting a small prize inside for more than 100 years, headds, and the turn-of-the-century steel magnate (巨头) Charles Schwab is said to have often come into his factory and written the number of tons of steel produced on the past shift on the factory floor, thus motivating the next shift of workers to beat the previous one.

E) But the word "gamification" and the widespread, conscious application of the concept only began in earnest about five years ago, Werbach says. Thanks in part to video games, the generation now entering the workforce is especially open to the idea of having their work gamified. "We are at a point where in much of the developed world the vast majority of young people grew up playing video games, and an increasingly high percentage of adults play these video games too," Werbach says.

F) A number of companies have sprung up--GamEffective, Bunchbail and Badgeville, to name a few--in recent years offering gamification platforms for businesses. The platforms that are most effective turn employees' ordinary job tasks into part of a rich adventure narrative. "What makes a gamegame-like is that the player actually cares about the outcome," Werbach says. "The principle is about understanding what is motivating to this group of players, which requires some understanding of psychology. "

G) Some people, Werbach says, are motivated by competition.Sales people often fall into this category. For them, the right kind of gamification might be turning their saies pitches into a competition with other team members, complete with a digital leader board showing who is winning at all times. Others are more motivated by collaboration and social experiences. One company Werbach has studied uses gamification to create a sense of community and boost employees' morale(士气). When employees log in to their computers, they're shown a picture of one of their coworkers and asked to guess that person's name.

H) Gamification does not have to be digital. Monica Cornetti runs a company that gamifies employee trainings. Sometimes this involves technology, but often it does not. She recently designed a gamification strategy for a saies training company with a storm-chasing theme. Employees formed"storm chaser teams" and competed in storm-themed educational exercises to earn various rewards. "Rewards do not have to be stuff," Cornetti says. "Rewards can be flexible working hours. " Another training, this one for pay roll law, used a Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs theme. "Snow White" is available for everyone to use, but the "dwarfs" are still under copyright,so Cornetti invented sound-alike characters (Grumpy Gus, Dopey Dan) to illustrate specific pay roll law principles.
I) Some people do not take naturally to gamified work environments, Cornetti says.In her experience, people in positions of power or people in finance or engineering do not tend to like the sound of the word. "If we are designing for engineers, I'm not talking about a ' game' at all,"Cornetti says. "I'm talking about a ' simulation' (模拟), I'm talking about ' being able to solve this problem. '"

J) Gamification is " not a magic bullet," Werbach warns.A gamification strategy that is not sufficiently thought through or well tailored to its players may engage people for a little while, but it will not motivate people in the long term. It can also be exploitative, especially when used with vulnerable populations. For workers, especially low-paid workers, who desperately need their jobs yet know they can be easily replaced, gamification may feel more like the Hunger Games. Werbach gives the example of several Disneyland hotels in Anaheim, Caiifornia, which used large digital leader boards to display how efficiently laundry workers were working compared to one another.Some employees found the board motivating. To others, it was the opposite of fun. Some began to stop taking bathroom breaks, worried that if their productivity fell they would be fired. Pregnant employees struggled to keep up. In a Los Angeles Times article, one employee referred to the board as a "digital whip. ""It actually had a very negative effect on morale and performance," Werbach says.

K) Still, gamification only stands to become more popular, he says, "as more and more people come into the workforce who are familiar with the structures and expressions of digital games. ""We are far from reaching the peak," Cornetti agrees. "There is no reason this will go away. "

36. Some famous companies are already using gamification and more are trying to do the same.

37. Gamification is not a miracle cure for all workplaces as it may have negative results.

38. To enhance morale, one company asks its employees to identify their fellow workers when starting their computers.

39. The idea of gamification was practiced by some businesses more than a century ago.

40. There is reason to believe that gamification will be here to stay.

41. Video games contributed in some ways to the wide application of gamification.

42. When turning work into a game, it is necessary to understand what makes games interesting.

43. Gamification in employee training does not always need technology.

44. The most successful gamification platforms transform daily work assignments into fun experiences.

45. It is necessary to use terms other than "gamification" for some profession.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A,B,C and D.You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based oil the following passage.

　　Recently I attended several meetings where we talked about ways to retain students and keep younger faculty members from going elsewhere.
　　It seems higher education has become an industry of meeting-holders whose task it is to "solve"problems--real or imagined. And in my position as a professor at three different colleges, the actual problems in educating our young people and older students have deepened, while the number of people hired--not to teach but to hold meetings--has increased significantly. Every new problem creates anew job for an administrative fixer. Take our Center for Teaching Excellence. Contrary to its title, the center is a clearing house (信息交流中心) for using technology in classrooms and in online courses.It's an administrative sham (欺诈) of the kind that has multiplied over the last 30 years.
　　I offer a simple proposition in response: Many of our problems--class attendance, educational success, student happiness and well-being--might be improved by cutting down the bureaucratic ( 官僚的) mechanisms and meetings and instead hiring an army of good teachers. If we replaced half of our administrative staff with classroom teachers, we might actually get a majority of our classes back to 20or fewer students per teacher. This would be an environment in which teachers and students actually knew each other.
　　The teachers must be free to teach in their own way--the curriculum should be flexible enough so that they can use their individual talents to achieve the goals of the course. Additionally, they should be allowed to teach, and be rewarded for doing it well. Teachers are not people who are great at and consumed by research and happen to appear in a classroom. Good teaching and research are not exclusive, but they are also not automatic companions. Teaching is an art and a craft, talent and practice; it is not something that just anyone can be good at. It is utterly confusing to me that people do not recognize this, despite the fact that pretty much anyone who has been a student can tell the difference between their best and worst teachers.

46. What does the author say about present-day universities?
A. They are effectively tackling real or imagined problems.
B. They often fail to combine teaching with research.
C. They are over-burdened with admires" trative staff.
D. They lack talent to fix their deepening problems.

47. According to the author, what kind of people do universities lack most?
A. Good classroom teachers. 
B. Efficient administrators. 
C. Talented researchers.
D. Motivated students.

48. What does the author imply about the classes at present?
A. They facilitate students' independent learning.
B. They help students form closer relationships.
C. They have more older students than before.
D. They are much bigger than is desirable.

49. What does the author think of teaching ability?
A. It requires talent and practice.
B. It is closely related to research.
C. It is a chief factor affecting students' learning.
D. It can be acquired through persistent practice.

50. What is the author's suggestion for improving university teaching?
A. Creating an environment for teachers to share their teaching experiences.
B. Hiring more classroom teachers and allowing them to teach in their own way.
C. Using high technology in classrooms and promoting exchange of information.
D. Cutting down meetings and encouraging administrative staff to go to classrooms.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　The secret to eating less and being happy about it may have been cracked years ago--by McDonald's. According to a new study from Cornell University's Food and Brand Lab, small non-food rewards--like the toys in McDonald's Happy Meals--stimulate the same reward centers in the brain as food does.
　　The researchers, led by Martin Reimann, carried out a series of experiments to see if people would choose a smaller meal ff it was paired with a non-food item.
　　They found that the majority of both kids and adults opted for a haft-sized portion when combined with a prize. Both options were priced the same.
　　Even more interesting is that the promise of a future reward was enough to make adults choose the smaller portion. One of the prizes used was a lottery ticket ( 彩票), with a $10, $ 50 or $100 payout,and this was as effective as a tangible gift in persuading people to eat less.
　　"The fact that participants were willing to substitute part of a food item for the mere prospect of a
　　relatively small monetary award is interesting," says Reimann.
　　He theorizes that it is the emotional component of these intangible prizes that make them effective.In fact, vaguely-stated possibilities of winning a prize were more effective than options with hard odds included.
　　"One explanation for this finding is that possible awards may be more emotionally provoking than certainty Reimann." The of added attraction and awards,"says uncertainty winning provides desirability through emotional ' thrills. ' The possibility of receiving an award also produces a state of hope--a state that is in itself psychologically rewarding. " In other words, there's a reason why people like to gamble.
　　How might this knowledge be used to help people eat more healthily?
　　One possibility is a healthy option that offers the chance to win a spa (温泉疗养) weekend. Or maybe the reward of a half-sized portion could be a half-sized dessert to be claimed only on a future date. That would get you back in the restaurant--and make you eat a little less.

51. What do we learn about McDonald's inclusion of toys in its Happy Meals?
A. It may shed light on people's desire to crack a secret.
B. It has proved to be key to McDonald's business success.
C. It appeals to kid's curiosity to fred out what is hidden inside.
D. It may be a pleasant way for kids to reduce their food intake.

52. What is the finding of the researchers led by Martin Reimann?
A. Reducing food intake is not that difficult if people go to McDonald's more.
B. Most kids and adults don't actually feel hungry when they eat half of their meal.
C. Eating a smaller portion of food does good to the health of kids and adults alike.
D. Most kids and adults would choose a smaller meal that came with a non-food item.

53. What is most interesting in Martin Reimann's finding?
A. Kids preferred an award in the form of money to one in the form of a toy.
B. Adults chose the smaller portion on the mere promise of a future award.
C. Both kids and adults felt satisfied with only half of their meal portions.
D. Neither children nor adults could resist the temptation of a free toy.

54. How does Martin Reimann interpret his finding?
A. The emotional component of the prizes is at work.
B. People now care more about quality than quantity.
C. People prefer certainty awards to possible awards.
D. The desire for a future reward is overwhelming.

55. What can we infer from Martin Reimann's finding?
A. People should eat much less if they wish to stay healthy and happy.
B. More fast food restaurants are likely to follow McDonald's example.
C. We can lead people to eat less while helping the restaurant business.
D. More studies are needed to find out the impact of emotion on behavior.

Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to translate a passage from Chinese into English. You should write your answer on Answer Sheet 2.

　　在中国文化中，红色通常象征着好运、长寿和幸福。在春节和其他喜庆场合，红色到处可见。人们把现金作为礼物送给家人或亲密朋友时，通常放在红信封里。红色在中国流行的另一个原因是人们把它与中国革命和共产党相联系。然而，红色并不总是代表好运和快乐。因为从前死者的名字常用红色书写，用红墨水书写中国人名被看成是一种冒犯行为。

 The Blessing and Curse of the People Who Never Forget
A handful of people can recall almost every day of their lives in enormous detail—and after years of research, neuroscientists (神经科学专家) are finally beginning to understand how they do it.
　　[A] For most of us, memory is a mess of blurred and faded pictures of our lives. As much as we would like to cling on to our past, even the saddest moments can be washed away with time.
　　[B] Ask Nima Veiseh what he was doing for any day in the past 15 years, however, and he will give you the details of the weather, what he was wearing, or even what side of the train he was sitting on his journey to work. “My memory is like a library of video tapes, walk-throughs of every day of my life from waking to sleeping,” he explains.
　　[C] Veiseh can even put a date on when those tapes started recording: 15 December 2000, when he met his first girlfriend at his best friend's 16th birthday party. He had always had a good memory, but the thrill of young love seems to have shifted a gear in his mind: from now on, he would start recording his whole life in detail. “I could tell you everything about every day after that.”
　　[D] Needless to say, people like Veiseh are of great interest to neuroscientists hoping to understand the way the brain records our lives. A couple of recent papers have finally opened a window on these people’s extraordinary minds. And such research might even suggest ways for us all to relive our past with greater clarity.
　　[E] “Highly superior autobiographical memory”（or HSAM for short) first came to light in the early 2000s, with a young woman named Jill Price. Emailing the neuroscientist and memory researcher Jim McGaugh one day, she claimed that she could recall every day of her life since the age of 12. Could he help explain her experiences?
　　[F] McGaugh invited her to his lab, and began to test her: he would give her a date and ask her to tell him about the world events on that day. True to her word, she was correct almost every time.
　　[G] It didn’t take long for magazines and documentary film-makers to come to understand her “total recall”， and thank to the subsequent media interest, a few dozen other subjects (including Veiseh) have since come forward and contacted the team at the University of California, Irvine.
　　[H] Interestingly, their memories are highly self-centred: although they can remember “autobiographical” life events in extraordinary detail, they seem to be no better than average at recalling impersonal information, such as random (任意选取的）lists of words. Nor are they necessarily better at remembering a round of drinks, say. And although their memories are vast, they are still likely to suffer from “false memories”.Clearly, there is no such thing as a “perfect” memory—their extraordinary minds are still using the same flawed tools that the rest of us rely on. The question is, how?
　　[I] Lawrence Patihis at the University of Southern Mississippi recently studied around 20 people with HSAM and found that they scored particularly high on two measures: fantasy proneness (倾向)and absorption. Fantasy proneness could be considered a tendency to imagine and daydream, whereas absorption is the tendency to allow your mind to become fully absorbed in an activity—to pay complete attention to the sensations (感受)and the experiences. “I’m extremely sensitive to sounds, smells and visual detail,” explains Nicole Donohue, who has taken part in many of these studies. “I definitely feel things more strongly than the average person.”
　　[J] The absorption helps them to establish strong foundations for recollection, says Patihis, and the fantasy proneness means that they revisit those memories again and again in the coming weeks and months. Each time this initial memory trace is “replayed”, it becomes even stronger. In some ways, you probably go through that process after a big event like your wedding day—but the difference is that thanks to their other psychological tendencies, the HSAM subjects are doing it day in, day out, for the whole of their lives.
　　[K] Not everyone with a tendency to fantasise will develop HSAM, though, so Patihis suggests that something must have caused them to think so much about their past. “Maybe some experience in their childhood meant that they became obsessed (着迷）with calendars and what happened to them,” says Patihis.
　　[L] The people with HSAM I’ve interviewed would certainly agree that it can be a mixed blessing. On the plus side, it allows you to relive the most transformative and enriching experiences. Veiseh, for instance, travelled a lot in his youth. In his spare time, he visited the local art galleries, and the paintings are now lodged deep in his autobiographical memories.
　　[M] “Imagine being able to remember every painting, on every wall, in every gallery space, between nearly 40 countries，” he says. “That’s a big education in art by itself.” With this comprehensive knowledge of the history of art, he has since become a professional painter.
　　[N] Donohue, now a history teacher, agrees that it helped during certain parts of her education. “I can definitely remember what I learned on certain days at school. I could imagine what the teacher was saying or what it looked like in the book.”
　　[O] Not everyone with HSAM has experienced these benefits, however. Viewing the past in high definition can make it very difficult to get over pain and regret. “It can be very hard to forget embarrassing moments,” says Donohue. “You feel the same emotions—it is just as raw, just as fresh... You can’t turn off that stream of memories, no matter how hard you try.” Veiseh agrees. “It is like having these open wounds—they are just a part of you,” he says.
　　[P] This means they often have to make a special effort to lay the past to rest. Bill, for instance, often gets painful “flashbacks”，in which unwanted memories intrude into his consciousness, but overall he has chosen to see it as the best way of avoiding repeating the same mistakes. “Some people are absorbed in the past but not open to new memories, but that’s not the case for me. I look forward to each day and experiencing something new.”
	36.People with HSAM have the same memory as ordinary people when it comes to impersonal information.
	37.Fantasy proneness will not necessarily cause people to develop HSAM.
	38.Veiseh began to remember the details of his everyday experiences after he met his first young love.
	39.Many more people with HSAM started to contact researchers due to the mass media.
	40.People with HSAM often have to make efforts to avoid focusing on the past.
	41.Most people do not have clear memories of past events.
	42.HSAM can be both a curse and a blessing.
	43.A young woman sought explanation from a brain scientist when she noticed her unusual memory.
	44.Some people with HSAM find it very hard to get rid of unpleasant memories.
	45.A recent study of people with HSAM reveals that they are liable to fantasy and full absorption in an activity.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　The phrase almost completes itself: midlife crisis. It’s the stage in the middle of the journey when people feel youth vanishing, their prospects narrowing and death approaching.
　　There’s only one problem with the cliche (套话).It isn’t true.
　　“In fact, there is almost no hard evidence for midlife crisis other than a few small pilot studies conducted decades ago,” Barbara Hagerty writes in her new book, Life Reimagined. The bulk of the research shows that there may be a pause, or a shifting of gears in the 40s or 50s, but this shift “can be exciting, rather than terrifying”.
Barbara Hagerty looks at some of the features of people who turn midlife into a rebirth. They break routines, because “autopilot is death”. They choose purpose over happiness一having a clear sense of purpose even reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. They give priority to relationships, as careers often recede(逐渐淡化).
　　Life Reimagined paints a picture of middle age that is far from gloomy. Midlife seems like the second big phase of decision-making. Your identity has been formed; you’ve built up your resources; and now you have the chance to take the big risks precisely because your foundation is already secure.
　　Karl Barth described midlife precisely this way. At middle age, he wrote, “the sowing is behind; now is the time to reap. The run has been taken; now is the time to leap. Preparation has been made; now is the time for the venture of the work itself.”
　　The middle-aged person, Barth continued, can see death in the distance, but moves with a “measured haste” to get big new things done while there is still time.
　　What Barth wrote decades ago is even truer today. People are healthy and energetic longer. We have presidential candidates running for their first term in office at age 68, 69 and 74. A longer lifespan is changing the narrative structure of life itself. What could have been considered the beginning of a descent is now a potential turning point—the turning point you are most equipped to take full advantage of.

46. What does the author think of the phrase “midlife crisis”？
	A) It has led to a lot of debate.           	B) It is widely acknowledged. 
	C) It is no longer fashionable.            	D) It misrepresents real life.
47.How does Barbara Hagerty view midlife?
	A) It may be the beginning of a crisis.	B) It can be a new phase of one’s life.
	C) It can be terrifying for the unprepared.	D)It may see old-age diseases approaching.
48.How is midlife pictured in the book Life Reimagined?
	A) It can be quite rosy.	B) It can be burdensome.
	C) It undergoes radical transformation.	D) It makes for the best part of one’s life.
49.According to Karl Barth, midlife is the time_______.
	A) to relax	B) to mature
	C) to harvest	D) to reflect
50.What does the author say about midlife today?
A) It is more meaningful than other stages of life.
B) It is likely to change the narrative of one’s life,
C) It is more important to those with a longer lifespan.
D)It is likely to be a critical turning point in one’s life.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　In spring, chickens start laying again, bringing a welcome source of protein at winter’s end. So it’s no surprise that cultures around the world celebrate spring by honoring the egg.
　　Some traditions are simple, like the red eggs that get baked into Greek Easter breads. Others elevate the egg into a fancy art, like the heavily jewel-covered “eggs” that were favored by the Russians starting in the 19th century.
　　One ancient form of egg art comes to us from Ukraine. For centuries, Ukrainians have been drawing complicated patterns on eggs. Contemporary artists have followed this tradition to create eggs that speak to the anxieties of our age: Life is precious, and delicate. Eggs are, too.
　　“There’s something about their delicate nature that appeals to me,” says New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast. Several years ago, she became interested in eggs and learned the traditional Ukrainian technique to draw her very modern characters. “I’ve broken eggs at every stage of the process—from the very beginning to the very, very end.”
　　But there’s an appeal in that vulnerability. “There’s part of this sickening horror of knowing you’re walking on the edge with this, that I kind of like, knowing that it could all fall apart at any second.” Chast’s designs, such as a worried man alone in a tiny rowboat, reflect that delicateness.
　　Traditional Ukrainian decorated eggs also spoke to those fears. The elaborate patterns were believed to offer protection against evil.
　　“There’s an ancient legend that as long as these eggs are made, evil will not prevail in the world,” says Joan Brander, a Canadian egg-painter who has been painting eggs for over 60 years, having learned the art from her Ukrainian relatives.
　　The tradition, dating back to 300 B.C., was later incorporated into the Christian church. The old symbols, however, still endure. A decorated egg with a bird on it, given to a young married couple, is a wish for children. A decorated egg thrown into the field would be a wish for a good harvest.

51.Why do people in many cultures prize the egg?
	A) It is a welcome sign of the coming of spring.
	B) It is their major source of protein in winter.
	C) It can easily be made into a work of art.
	D) It can bring wealth and honor to them.
52.What do we learn about the decorated “eggs” in Russia?
	A) They are shaped like jewel cases.	B) They are cherished by the rich.
	C) They are heavily painted in red.	D) They are favored as a form of art.
53.Why have contemporary artists continued the egg art tradition?
	A) Eggs serve as an enduring symbol of new life.
	B) Eggs have an oval shape appealing to artists.
	C) Eggs reflect the anxieties of people today.
	D) Eggs provide a unique surface to paint on.
54.Why does Chast enjoy the process of decorating eggs?
	A) She never knows if the egg will break before the design is completed.
	B) She can add multiple details to the design to communicate her idea.
	C) She always derives great pleasure from designing something new.
	D) She is never sure what the final design will look like until the end.
55.What do we learn from the passage about egg-painting?
	A) It originated in the eastern part of Europe.
	B) It has a history of over two thousand years.
	C) It is the most time-honored form of fancy art.
	D) It is especially favored as a church decoration.

　　　Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs.

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
　　 Team spirit
　　[A] Teams have become the basic building blocks of organizations. Recruitment advertisements routinely call for “team players”. Business schools grade their students in part on their performance in group projects. Office managers knock down walls to encourage team building. Teams are as old as civilization, of course: even Jesus had 12 co-workers. But a new report by Deloitte, “Global Human Capital Trends”, based on a survey of more than 7,000 executives in over 130 countries, suggests that the fashion for teamwork has reached a new high. Almost half of those surveyed said their companies were either in the middle of restructuring or about to embark on (开始）it; and for the most part, restructuring meant putting more emphasis on teams.
　　[B] Companies are abandoning conventional functional departments and organising employees into cross-disciplinary teams that focus on particular products, problems or customers. These teams are gaining more power to run their own affairs. They are also spending more time working with each other rather than reporting upwards. Deloitte argues that a new organisational form is on the rise: a network of teams is replacing the conventional hierarchy (等级体制).
　　[C] The fashion for teams is driven by a sense that the old way of organising people is too rigid for both the modem marketplace and the expectations of employees. Technological innovation places greater value on agility (灵活性).John Chambers, chairman of Cisco Systems Inc., a worldwide leader in electronics products, says that “we compete against market transitions (过渡)，not competitors. Product transitions used to take five or seven years; now they take one or two. ” Digital technology also makes it easier for people to co-ordinate their activities without resorting to hierarchy. The “millennials” (千禧一代) who will soon make up half the workforce in rich countries were raised from nursery school onwards to work in groups.
　　[D] The fashion for teams is also spreading from the usual corporate suspects (such as GE and IBM) to some more unusual ones. The Cleveland Clinic, a hospital operator, has reorganised its medical staff into teams to focus on particular treatment areas; consultants, nurses and others collaborate closely instead of being separated by speciality (专业)and rank. The US Army has gone the same way. In his book, “Team of Teams' General Stanley McChrystal describes how the army’s hierarchical structure hindered its operations during the early stages of the Iraq war. His solution was to learn something from the rebels it was fighting: decentralising authority to self-organising teams.
　　[E] A good rule of thumb is that as soon as generals and hospital administrators jump on a management bandwagon, it is time to ask questions. Leigh Thompson of Kellogg School of Management in Illinois warns that, ‘Teams are not always the answer—teams may provide insight, creativity and knowledge in a way that a person working independently cannot; but teamwork may also lead to confusion, delay and poor decision-making.” The late Richard Hackman of Harvard University once argued, “I have no question that when you have a team, the possibility exists that it will generate magic, producing something extraordinary... But don’t count on it.”
　　[F] Hackman (who died in 2013) noted that teams are hindered by problems of co-ordination and motivation that chip away at the benefits of collaboration. High-flyers forced to work in teams may be undervalued and free-riders empowered. Group-think may be unavoidable. In a study of 120 teams of senior executives, he discovered that less than 10% of their supposed members agreed on who exactly was on the team. If it is hard enough to define a team’s membership, agreeing on its purpose is harder still.
　　[G] Profound changes in the workforce are making teams trickier to manage. Teams work best if their members have a strong common culture. This is hard to achieve when, as is now the case in many big firms, a large proportion of staff are temporary contractors. Teamwork improves with time: America’s National Transportation Safety Board found that 73% of the incidents in its civil-aviation database occurred on a crew’s first day of flying together. However, as Amy Edmondson of Harvard points out, organisations increasingly use “team” as a verb rather than a noun: they form teams for specific purposes and then quickly disband them.
　　[H] The least that can be concluded from this research is that companies need to think harder about managing teams. They need to rid their minds of sentimentalism (感情用事)：the most successful teams have leaders who are able to set an overall direction and take immediate action. They need to keep teams small and focused: giving in to pressure to be more “inclusive” is a guarantee of dysfunction. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s boss, says that “If I see more than two pizzas for lunch, the team is too big.” They need to immunize teams against group-think: Hackman argued that the best ones contain “deviants” (离经叛道者）who are willing to do something that maybe upsetting to others.
　　[I] A new study of 12,000 workers in 17 countries by Steelcase, a furniture-maker which also does consulting, finds that the best way to ensure employees are “engaged” is to give them more control over where and how they do their work―which may mean liberating them from having to do everything in collaboration with others.
　　[J] However, organisations need to learn something bigger than how to manage teams better: they need to be in the habit of asking themselves whether teams are the best tools for the job. Teambuilding skills are in short supply: Deloitte reports that only 12% of the executives they contacted feel they understand the way people work together in networks and only 21% feel confident in their ability to build cross-functional teams. Loosely managed teams can become hotbeds of distraction―employees routinely complain that they can’t get their work done because they are forced to spend too much time in meetings or compelled to work in noisy offices. Even in the age of open-plan offices and social networks some work is best left to the individual.

Section C
　　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　Shoppers in the UK are spending less money on toilet paper to save money, research has shown.
　　Penny-pinching UK consumers choose cheaper products from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl rather than luxury alternatives.
　　This has wiped 6% off the value of the soft tissue paper market in the UK. It has shrunk from £1.19 billion in 2011 to £1.12 billion in 2015,according to a new report from market research company Mintel. Furthermore, the future of the market looks far from rosy, with sales expected to fall further to £1.11 billion in 2016.
　　In the last year alone, despite an increase in the UK population and a subsequent rise in the number of households, sales of toilet paper fell by 2%, with the average household reducing their toilet roll spending from £43 in 2014 to £41 in 2015.
　　Overall, almost three in five people say they try to limit their usage of paper—including facial tissue and kitchen roll―to save money. “Strength，softness and thickness remain the leading indicators of toilet paper quality, with just a small proportion of consumers preferring more luxurious alternatives, such as those with flower patterns or perfume,” said Mintel analyst Jack Duckett. ''These extra features are deemed unnecessary by the majority of shoppers, which probably reflects how these types of products are typically more expensive than regular toilet paper, even when on special offer.”
　　While consumers are spending less on toilet paper, they remain fussy―in theory at least—when it comes to paper quality. Top of Britons’ toilet paper wish list is softness (57%) followed by strength (45%) and thickness (36%).
　　One in 10 buyers rank toilet rolls made from recycled paper among their top considerations, highlighting how overall the environment is much less of a consideration for shoppers than product quality. In a challenge for manufacturers, 81% of paper product users said they would consider buying recycled toilet tissue if it were comparable in quality to standard paper.
46. The market sales of toilet paper have decreased because	.
	A) Britons have cut their spending on it
	B) its prices have gone up over the years
	C) its quality has seen marked improvement
	D) Britons have developed the habit of saving
47. What does the author think of the future of the tissue paper market in the UK?
	A) It will expand in time.
	B) It will remain gloomy.
	C) It will experience ups and downs.
	D) It will recover as population grows.
48. What does Jack Duckett say about toilet paper?
	A) Special offers would promote its sales.
	B) Consumers are loyal to certain brands.
	C) Luxurious features add much to the price.
	D) Consumers have a variety to choose from.
49. What do we learn about Britons concerning toilet paper?
	A) They are particular about the quality of toilet paper.
	B) They emphasize the strength of toilet paper the most.
	C) They prefer cheap toilet paper to recycled toilet paper.
	D) They reject using toilet paper with unnecessary features.
50. What can we infer from the last paragraph?
	A) More and more Britons buy recycled toilet paper to protect the environment.
	B) Toilet paper manufacturers are facing a great challenge in promoting its sales.
	C) Toilet paper manufacturers compete with one another to improve product quality.
	D) Environmental protection is not much of a concern when Britons buy toilet paper.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　“One of the reasons I find this topic very interesting is because my mom was a smoker when I was younger，” says Lindson-Hawley, who studies tobacco and health at the University of Oxford.
　　By studying about 700 adult smokers, she found out that her mom quit the right way—by stopping abruptly and completely.
　　In her study, participants were randomly (随机地）assigned to two groups. One had to quit abruptly on a given day, going from about a pack a day to zero. The other cut down gradually over the course of two weeks. People in both groups used nicotine (尼古丁）patches before they quit, in addition to a second form of nicotine replacement, like gum or spray. They also had talk therapy with a nurse before and after quit day.
　　Six months out, more people who had quit abruptly had stuck with it—more than one-fifth of them, compared to about one-seventh in the other group. Although these numbers appear low, it is much higher than if people try without support.
　　And the quit rates were particularly convincing given that before the study started, most of the people had said they’d rather cut down gradually before quitting. “If you’re training for a marathon, you wouldn’t expect to turn up and just be able to run it. And I think people see that for smoking as well. They think,‘ Well， if I gradually reduce, it’s like practice，’” says Lindson-Hawley. But that wasn’t the case. Instead of giving people practice, the gradual reduction likely gave them cravings (瘾）and withdrawal symptoms before they even reached quit day, which could be why fewer people in that group actually made it to that point. “Regardless of your stated preference, if you’re ready to quit, quitting abruptly is more effective,”says Dr. Gabriela Ferreira. “When you can quote a specific number like a fifth of the patients were able to quit, that’s compelling. It gives them the encouragement, I think, to really go for it，’’ Ferreira says.
　　People rarely manage to quit the first time they try. But at least, she says, they can maximize the odds of success.
51. What does Lindson-Hawley say about her mother?
	A) She quit smoking with her daughter’s help.
	B) She succeeded in quitting smoking abruptly.
	C) She was also a researcher of tobacco and health.
	D) She studied the smoking patterns of adult smokers.
52.What kind of support did smokers receive to quit smoking in Lindson-Hawley’s study?
	A) They were given physical training.
	B) They were looked after by physicians.
	C) They were encouraged by psychologists.
	D) They were offered nicotine replacements.
53. How does Dr. Gabriela Ferreira view the result of Lindson-Hawley’s experiment?
	A) It is idealized.
	B) It is unexpected.
	C) It is encouraging.
	D) It is misleading.
54. The idea of “a marathon” （Line 2, Para. 5) illustrates the popular belief that quitting smoking
	A) is something few can accomplish
	B) needs some practice first
	C) requires a lot of patience
	D) is a challenge at the beginning
55. What happens when people try to quit smoking gradually?
	A) They find it even more difficult.
	B) They are simply unable to make it.
	C) They show fewer withdrawal symptoms.
	D) They feel much less pain in the process.

　　　From Accountant to Yogi: Making a Radical Career Change
　　[A] At some point, almost all of us will experience a period of radical professional change. Some of us will seek it out; for others it will feel like an unwelcome intrusion into otherwise stable careers. Either way, we have choices about how we respond to it when it comes.
　　[B] We recently caught up with yoga entrepreneur Leah Zaccaria, who put herself through the fire of change to completely reinvent herself. In her search to live a life of purpose, Leah left her high-paying accounting job, her husband, and her home, In the process, she built a radically new life and career. Since then, she has founded two yoga studios, met a new life partner, and formed a new community of people. Even if your personal reinvention is less drastic, we think there are lessons from her experience that apply.
　　[C] Where do the seeds of change come from? the Native American Indians have a saying: “Pay attention to the whispers so you won’t have to hear the screams.” Often the best ideas for big changes come from unexpected places — it’s just a matter of tuning in. Great leaders recognize the weak signals or slight signs that point to big changes to come. Leah reflects on a time she listened to the whispers: “About the time my daughter was five years old. I started having a sense that ‘this isn’t right.”’ She then realized that her life no longer matched her vision for it.
　　[D] Up until that point, Leah had followed traditional measures of success. After graduating with a degree in business and accounting, she joined a public accounting firm, married, bought a house, put lots of stuff in it, and had a baby. “I did what everybody else thought looked successful,” she says. Leah easily could have fallen into a trap of feeling content; instead, her energy sparked a period of experimentation and renewal.
　　[E] Feeling the need to change, Leah started playing with future possibilities by exploring her interests and developing new capabilities. First trying physical exercise and dieting, she lost some weight and discovered an inner strength. “1 felt powerful because 1 broke through my own limitations,” she recalls.
　　[F] However, it was another interest that led Leah to radically reinvent herself. “I remember sitting on a bench with my aunt at a yoga studio,’’ she said, “and having a moment of clarity right then and there: Yoga is saving my life. Yoga is waking me up. I’m not happy and I want to change and I’m done with this.” In that moment of clarity Leah made an important leap,conquering her inner resistance to change and making a firm commitment to take bigger steps.
　　[G] Creating the future you want is a lot easier if you are ready to exploit the opportunities that come your way. When Leah made the commitment to change, she primed herself to new opportunities she may otherwise have overlooked. She recalls:
　　[H] One day a man I worked with, Ryan, who had his office next to mine, said, “Leah, let’s go look at this space on Queen Anne.” He knew my love for yoga and had seen a space close to where he lived that he thought might be good to serve as a yoga studio. As soon as I saw the location, I knew this was it. Of course I was scared, yet I had this strong sense of “I have to do this.” Only a few months later Leah opened her first yoga studio, but success was not instant.
　　[I] Creating the future takes time. That’s why leaders continue to manage the present while building toward the big changes of the future. When it’s time to make the leap, they take action and immediately drop what’s no longer serving their purpose. Initially Leah stayed with her accounting job while starting up the yoga studio to make it all work.
　　[J] Soon after, she knew she had to make a bold move to fully commit to her new future. Within two years, Leah shed the safety of her accounting job and made the switch complete. Such drastic change is not easy.
　　[K] Steering through change and facing obstacles brings us face to face with our fears. Leah reflects on one incident that triggered her fears, when her investors threatened to shut her down: “I was probably up against the most fear I’ve ever had，” she says. “I had spent two years cultivating this community, and it had become successful very fast, but within six months I was facing the prospect of losing it all.”
　　
　　[L] She connected with her sense of purpose and dug deep, cultivating a tremendous sense of strength. “I was feeling so intentional and strong that I wasn’t going to let fear just take over. I was thinking, ‘OK, guys, if you want to try to shut me down, shut me down.’And I knew it was a negotiation scheme, so I was able to say to myself, ‘This is not real.’” By naming her fears and facing them head-on, Leah gained confidence. For most of us, letting go of the safety and security of the past gives us great fear. Calling out our fears explicitly, as Leah did,can help us act decisively.
　　[M] The cycle of renewal never ends. Leah’s growth spurred her to open her second studio— and it wasn’t for the money.
　　[N] I have no desire to make millions of dollars. It’s not about that; it’s about growth for me. Honestly, I didn’t need to open a second studio. I was making as much money as I was as an accountant. But I know if you don’t grow, you stand still, and that doesn’t work for me.
　　[O] Consider the current moment in your own life, your team or your organization. Where are you in the cycle of renewal: Are you actively preserving the present, or selectively forgetting the past, or boldly creating the future? What advice would Leah give you to move you ahead on your journey? Once we’re on the path of growth, we can continually move through the seasons of transformation and renewal.
　36. Readiness to take advantage of new opportunities will make it easier to create one’s desired future.
　37. By conventional standards, Leah was a typical successful woman before she changed her career.
　38. Leah gained confidence by laying out her fears and confronting them directly.
　39. In search of a meaningful life, Leah gave up what she had and set up her own yoga studios.
　40 Leah's interest in yoga prompted her to make a firm decision to reshape her life.
　41. Small signs may indicate great changes to come and therefore merit attention.
　42. Leah’s first yoga studio was by no means an immediate success.
　43. Some people regard professional change as an unpleasant experience that disturbs their stable careers.
　44. The worst fear Leah ever had was the prospect of losing her yoga business.
　45. As she explored new interests and developed new potentials，Leah felt powerful internally.
Section C
　　　Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　Urbanization — migration away from the suburbs to the city center — will be the biggest real estate trend in 2015, according to a new report.
　　The report says America’s urbanization will continue to be the most significant issue affecting the industry, as cities across the country imitate the walkability and transit-oriented development making cities like New York and San Francisco so successful.
　　As smaller cities copy the model of these “24-hour cities，’’ more affordable versions of these places will be created. The report refers to this as the coming of the “18-hour city,” and uses the term to refer to cities like Houston, Austin, Charlotte, and Nashville, which are “positioning themselves as highly competitive, in terms of livability, employment offerings, and recreational and cultural facilities.” 
　　Another trend that looks significant in 2015 is that America’s largest population group, Millennials (千禧一代)，will continue to put off buying a house. Apartments will retain their appeal for a while for Millennials, haunted by what happened to home-owning parents.
　　This trend will continue into the 2020s, the report projects. After that, survey respondents disagree over whether this generation will follow in their parents，footsteps, moving to the suburbs to raise families, or will choose to remain in the city center.
　　Another issue affecting real estate in the coming year will be America’s failing infrastructure. Most roads, bridges, transit, water systems, the electric grid, and communications networks were installed 50 to 100 years ago, and they are largely taken for granted until they fail.
　　The report’s writers state that America’s failure to invest in infrastructure impacts not only the health of the real-estate market, but also our ability to remain globally competitive.
　　Apart from the specific trends highlighted above, which cause some investors to worry, the report portrays an overall optimism borne by the recent healthy real-estate “upcycle” and improving economy. Seventy-four percent of the respondents surveyed report a “good to excellent” expectation of real-estate profitability in 2015. While excessive optimism can promote bad investment patterns, resulting in a real- estate “bubble,” the report’s writers downplay that potential outcome in that it has not yet occurred.

46. According to the new report, real estate development in 2015 will witness_______ .
　　A) an accelerating speed							B) a shift to city centers
　　 C) a new focus on small cities				 	D) an ever-increasing demand
47. What characterizes “24-hour cities” like New York?
	A) People can live without private cars.        B) People are generally more competitive.
	C) People can enjoy services around the clock.   D) People are in harmony with the environment.
48. Why are Millennials reluctant to buy a house?
	A) They can only afford small apartments.
	B) The house prices are currently too high.
	C) Their parents' bad experience still haunts them.
	D) They feel attached to the suburban environment.
49. What might hinder real estate development in the U.S.?
	A) The continuing economic recession in the country.
	B) The lack of confidence on the part of investors.
	C) The fierce global competition.
	D) The worsening infrastructure.
50. How do most of the respondents in the survey feel about the U.S. real-estate market in 2015?
	A) Pessimistic.	                			B) Hopeful.
	C) Cautious.	                				D) Uncertain.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　The brain is a seemingly endless library, whose shelves house our most precious memories as well as our lifetime’s knowledge. But is there a point where it reaches capacity?
　　The answer is no, because brains are more sophisticated than that. Instead of just crowding in, old information is sometimes pushed out of the brain for new memories to form.
　　Previous behavioural studies have shown that learning new information can lead to forgetting. But in a new study, researchers demonstrated for the first time how this effect occurs in the brain.
　　In daily life, forgetting actually has clear advantages. Imagine, for instance, that you lost your bank card. The new card you receive will come with a new personal identificatipn number (PIN). Each time you remember the new PIN, you gradually forget the old one. This process improves access to relevant information, without old memories interfering.
　　And most of us may sometimes feel the frustration of having old memories interfere with new, relevant memories. Consider trying to remember where you parked your car in the same car park you were at a week earlier. This type of memory (where you are trying to remember new, but similar information) is particularly vulnerable to interference.
　　When we acquire new information, the brain automatically tries to incorporate (合并)it within existing information by forming associations. And when we retrieve (检索) information, both the desired and associated but irrelevant information is recalled.,
　　The majority of previous research has focused on how we learn and remember new information. But current studies are beginning to place greater emphasis on the conditions under which we forget, as its importance begins to be more appreciated.
　　A very small number of people are able to remember almost every detail of their life. While it may sound like an advantage to many, people with this rare condition often find their unusual ability burdensome.
　　In a sense, forgetting is our brain’s way of sorting memories, so the most relevant memories are ready for retrieval. Normal forgetting may even be a safety mechanism to ensure our brain doesn’t become too full.

51. What have past behavioural studies found about our brain?
 	A) Its capacity actually knows no limits.
	B) It grows sophisticated with practice.
	C) It keeps our most precious memories until life’s end.
　　D) New information learned pushes old information out. 
52. What is the benefit of forgetting?
    A) It frees us from painful memories.
    B) It helps slow down our aging process.
    C) It facilitates our access to relevant information.
　　D) It prevents old information from forming associations.
53. What is the emphasis of current studies of memory?
    A) When people tend to forget.
    B) What contributes to forgetting.
    C) How new technology hinders memory capacity.
　　D) Why learning and forgetting are complementary.
54. What do people find about their rare ability to remember every detail of their life?
    A) It adds to the burden of their memory.
    B) It makes their life more complicated.
    C) It contributes to their success in life.
　　D) It constitutes a rare object of envy.
55. What does the passage say about forgetting?
    A) It can enlarge our brain capacity.
    B) It helps get rid of negative memories.
    C) It is a way of organising our memories.
    D) It should not cause any alarm in any way.

Part Ⅲ                      Reading Comprehension                ( 40 minutes )
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　A rat or pigeon might not be the obvious choice to tend to someone who is sick, but these creatures have some 26 skills that could help the treatment of human diseases.
　　Pigeons are often seen as dirty birds and an urban 27 , but they are just the latest in a long line of animals that have been found to have abilities to help humans. Despite having a brain no bigger than the 28 of your index finger, pigeons have a very impressive 29 memory. Recently it was shown that they could be trained to be as accurate as humans at detecting breast cancer in images.
　　Rats are often 30 with spreading disease rather than 31 it, but this long-tailed animal is highly 32 . Inside a rat's nose are up to 1,000 different types of olfactory receptors (嗅觉感受器), whereas humans only have 100 to 200 types. This gives rats the ability to detect 33 smells. As a result, some rats are being put to work to detect TB(肺结核). When the rats detect the smell, they stop and rub their legs to 34 a sample is infected.
　　Traditionally, a hundred samples would take lab technicians more than two days to 35 , but for a rat it takes less than 20 minutes. This rat detection method doesn't rely on specialist equipment. It is also more accurate — the rats are able to find more TB infections and, therefore, save more lives.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Do In-Class Exams Make Students Study Harder?
Research suggests they may study more broadly for the unexpected rather than search for answers.
[A] I have always been a poor test-taker. So it may seem rather strange that I have returned to college to finish the degree I left undone some four decades ago. I am making my way through Columbia University, surrounded by students who quickly supply the verbal answer while I am still processing the question.
[B] Since there is no way for me to avoid exams, I am currently questioning what kind are the most taxing and ultimately beneficial. I have already sweated through numerous in-class midterms and finals, and now I have a professor who issues take-home ones. I was excited when I learned this, figuring I had a full week to do the research, read the texts, and write it all up. In fact, I was still rewriting my midterm the morning it was due. To say I had lost the thread is putting it mildly.
[C] As I was suffering through my week of anxiety, overthinking the material and guessing my grasp of it, I did some of my own polling among students and professors. David Eisenbach, who teaches a popular class on U.S. presidents at Columbia, prefers the in-class variety. He believes students ultimately learn more and encourages them to form study groups. “That way they socialize over history outside the class, which wouldn’t happen without the pressure of an in-class exam,” he explained, “Furthermore, in-class exams force students to learn how to perform under pressure, an essential work skill.”
[D] He also says there is less chance of cheating with the in-class variety. In 2012, 125 students at Harvard were caught up in a scandal when it was discovered they had cheated on a take-home exam for a class entitled “Introduction To Congress.” Some colleges have what they call an “honor code,” though if you are smart enough to get into these schools, you are either smart enough to get around any codes or hopefully, too ethical to consider doing so. As I sat blocked and clueless for two solid days, I momentarily wondered if I couldn’t just call an expert on the subject matter which I was tackling, or someone who took the class previously, to get me going.
[E] Following the Harvard scandal, Mary Miller, the former dean of students at Yale, made an impassioned appeal to her school’s professors to refrain from take-home exams. “Students risk health and well being, as well as performance in other end-of-term work, when faculty offers take-home exams without clear, time-limited boundaries,” she told me. “Research now shows that regular quizzes, short essays, and other assignments over the course of a term better enhance learning and retention.”
[F] Most college professors agree the kind of exam they choose largely depends on the subject. A quantitative-based one, for example, is unlikely to be sent home, where one could ask their older brothers and sisters to help. Vocational-type classes, such as computer science or journalism, on the other hand, are often more research-oriented and lend themselves to take-home testing. Chris Koch, who teaches “History of Broadcast Journalism” at Montgomery Community College in Rockville, Maryland, points out that reporting is about investigation rather than the memorization of minute details. “In my field, it’s not what you know—it’s what you know how to find out,” says Koch. “There is way too much information, and more coming all the time, for anyone to remember. I want my students to search out the answers to questions by using all the resources available to them.
[G] Students’ test-form preferences vary, too, often depending on the subject and course difficulty. “I prefer take-home essays because it is then really about the writing, so you have time to edit and do more research,” says Elizabeth Dresser, a junior at Barnard. Then there is the stress factor. Francesca Haass, a senior at Middlebury, says, “I find the in-class ones are more stressful in the short term, but there is immediate relief as you swallow information like mad, and then you get to forget it all. Take-homes require thoughtful engagement which can lead to longer term stress as there is never a moment when the time is up.” Meanwhile, Olivia Rubin, a sophomore at Emory, says she hardly even considers take-homes true exams. “If you understand the material and have the ability to articulate (说出) your thoughts, they should be a breeze.”
[H] How students ultimately handle tests may depend on their personal test-taking abilities. There are people who always wait until the last minute, and make it much harder than it needs to be. And then there are those who, not knowing what questions are coming at them, and having no resources to refer to, can freeze. And then there are we rare folks who fit both those descriptions.
[I] Yes, my advanced age must factor into the equation (等式), in part because of my inability to access the information as quickly. As another returning student at Columbia, Kate Marber, told me, “We are learning not only all this information, but essentially how to learn again. Our fellow students have just come out of high school. A lot has changed since we were last in school.”
[J] If nothing else, the situation has given my college son and me something to share, When I asked his opinion on this matter, he responded, “I like in-class exams because the time is already reserved, as opposed to using my free time at home to work on a test,” he responded. It seems to me that a compromise would be receiving the exam questions a day or two in advance, and then doing the actual test in class with the ticking clock overhead.
[K] Better yet, how about what one Hunter College professor reportedly did recently for her final exam: She encouraged the class not to stress or even study, promising that, “It is going to be apiece of cake.” When the students came in, sharpened pencils in hand, there was not a bluebook in sight. Rather, they saw a large chocolate cake and they each were given a slice.
　36. Elderly students find it hard to keep up with the rapid changes in education.
　37. Some believe take-home exams may affect students' performance in other courses.
　38. Certain professors believe in-class exams are ultimately more helpful to students.
　39. In-class exams are believed to discourage cheating in exams.
　40. The author was happy to learn she could do some exams at home.
　41. Students who put off their work until the last moment often find the exams more difficult than they actually are.
　42. Different students may prefer different types of exams.
　43. Most professors agree whether to give an in-class or a take-home exam depends on the type of course being taught.
　44. The author dropped out of college some forty years ago.
　45. Some students think take-home exams will eat up their free time.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　That people often experience trouble sleeping in a different bed in unfamiliar surroundings is a phenomenon known as the “first-night” effect. If a person stays in the same room the following night they tend to sleep more soundly. Yuka Sasaki and her colleagues at Brown University set out to investigate the origins of this effect.
　　Dr. Sasaki knew the first-night effect probably has something to do with how humans evolved. The puzzle was what benefit would be gained from it when performance might be affected the following day. She also knew from previous work conducted on birds and dolphins that these animals put half of their brains to sleep at a time so that they can rest while remaining alert enough to avoid predators (捕食者). This led her to wonder if people might be doing the same thing. To take a closer look, her team studied 35 healthy people as they slept in the unfamiliar environment of the university’s Department of Psychological Sciences. The participants each slept in the department for two nights and were carefully monitored with techniques that looked at the activity of their brains. Dr. Sasaki found, as expected, the participants slept less well on their first night than they did on their second, taking more than twice as long to fall asleep and sleeping less overall. During deep sleep, the participants’ brains behaved in a similar manner seen in birds and dolphins. On the first night only, the left hemispheres (半球) of their brains did not sleep nearly as deeply as their right hemispheres did.
　　Curious if the left hemispheres were indeed remaining awake to process information detected in the surrounding environment, Dr. Sasaki re-ran the experiment while presenting the sleeping participants with a mix of regularly timed beeps (蜂鸣声) of the same tone and irregular beeps of a different tone during the night. She worked out that, if the left hemisphere was staying alert to keep guard in a strange environment, then it would react to the irregular beeps by stirring people from sleep and would ignore the regularly timed ones. This is precisely what she found.
　46. What did researchers find puzzling about the first-night effect?
　　A) To what extent it can trouble people.	C) What circumstances may trigger it.
　　B) What role it has played in evolution. 	D) In what way it can be beneficial.
　47. What do we learn about Dr. Yuka Sasaki doing her research?
　　A) She found birds and dolphins remain alert while asleep.
　　B) She found birds and dolphins sleep in much the same way.
　　C) She got some idea from previous studies on birds and dolphins
　　D) She conducted studies on birds’ and dolphins’ sleeping patterns.
　48. What did Dr. Sasaki do when she first did her experiment? 
　　A) She monitored the brain activity of participants sleeping in a new environment.
　　B) She recruited 35 participants from her Department of Psychological Sciences.
　　C) She studied the differences between the two sides of participants’ brains.
　　D) She tested her findings about birds and dolphins on human subjects.
　49. What did Dr. Sasaki do when re-running her experiment?
　　A) She analyzed the negative effect of irregular tones on brains.
　　B) She recorded participants’ adaptation to changed environment.
　　C) She exposed her participants to two different stimuli.
　　D) She compared the responses of different participants.
　50. What did Dr. Sasaki find about the participants in her experiment?
　　A) They tended to enjoy certain tones more than others.
　　B) They tended to perceive irregular beeps as a threat.
　　C) They felt sleepy when exposed to regular beeps.
　　D) They differed in their tolerance of irregular tones.
　　Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　It’s time to reevaluate how women handle conflict at work. Being overworked or over-committed at home and on the job will not get you where you want to be in life. It will only slow you down and hinder your career goals.
　　Did you know women are more likely than men to feel exhausted? Nearly twice as many women than men ages 18-44 reported feeling “very tired” or “exhausted”, according to a recent study.
　　This may not be surprising given that this is the age range when women have children. It's also the age range when many women are trying to balance careers and home. One reason women may feel exhausted is that they have a hard time saying "no." Women want to be able to do it all—volunteer for school parties or cook delicious meals-and so their answer to any request is often “Yes, I can.”
　　Women struggle to say “no” in the workplace for similar reasons, including the desire to be liked by their colleagues. Unfortunately, this inability to say "no" may be hurting women's heath as well as their career.
　　At the workplace, men use conflict as a way to position themselves, while women often avoid conflict or strive to be the peacemaker, because they don't want to be viewed as aggressive or disruptive at work. For example, there’s a problem that needs to be addressed immediately, resulting in a dispute over who should be the one to fix it. Men are more likely to face that dispute from the perspective of what benefits them most, whereas women may approach the same dispute from the perspective of what's the easiest and quickest way to resolve the problem-even if that means doing the boring work themselves.
　　This difference in handling conflict could be the deciding factor on who gets promoted to a leadership position and who does not. Leaders have to be able to delegate and manage resources wisely – including staff expertise. Shouldering more of the workload may not earn you that promotion. Instead, it may highlight your inability to delegate effectively.
　51. What does the author say is the problem with women?
　　A) They are often unclear about the career goals to reach.
　　B) They are usually more committed at home than on the job.
　　C) They tend to be over-optimistic about how far they could go.
　　D) They tend to push themselves beyond the limits of their ability.
　52. Why do working women of child-bearing age tend to feel drained of energy?
　　A) They struggle to satisfy the demands of both work and home.
　　B) They are too devoted to work and unable to relax as a result.
　　C) They do their best to cooperate with their workmates.
　　D) They are obliged to take up too many responsibilities.
　53. What may hinder the future prospects of career women? 
　　A) Their unwillingness to say “no”.
　　B) Their desire to be considered powerful.
　　C) An underestimate of their own ability.
　　D) A lack of courage to face challenges.
　54. Men and woman differ in their approach to resolving workplace conflicts in that______.
　　A) women tend to be easily satisfied
　　B) men are generally more persuasive
　　C) men tend to put their personal interests first
　　D) women are much more ready to compromise
　55. What is important to a good leader?
　　A) A dominant personality. 	C) The courage to admit failure
　　B) The ability to delegate. 	D) A strong sense of responsibility.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　Technological changes brought dramatic new options to Americans living in the 1990s. During this decade new forms of entertainment, commerce, research, and communication became commonplace in the U. S. The driving force behind much of this change was a(n) 26 popularly known as the Internet.
　　The Internet was developed during the 1970s by the Department of Defense. In the case of an attack, military advisers suggested the 27 of being able to operate one computer from another terminal. In the early days, the Internet was used mainly by scientists to communicate with other scientists. The Internet 28 under government control until 1984.
　　One early problem faced by Internet users was speed. Phone lines could only transmit information at a 29 rate. The development of fiber-optic(光纤) cables allowed for billions of bits of information to be received every minute. Companies like Intel developed faster microprocessors, so personal computers could process the 30 signals at a more rapid rate.
　　In the early 1990s, the World Wide Web was developed, in large part, for 31 purposes. Corporations created home pages where they could place text and graphics to sell products. Soon airline tickets, hotel 32 ,and even cars and homes could be purchased online. Universities 33 research data on the Internet, so students could find 34 information without leaving their dormitories. Companies soon discovered that work could be done at home and 35 online, so a whole new class of telecommuters began to earn a living from home offices unshaven and wearing pajamas(睡衣).

A）advantage               I）maintained
B）commercial              J）occupations
C）conservation             K）posted
D）equipped                L）remained
E）incoming                M）reservations
F）innovation                N）submitted
G）limited                  O）valuable
H）local
Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
　　　　　The Health Benefits of Knitting
　　A)About 15 years ago, I was invited to join a knitting group. I agreed to give it a try. 

　　B)My mother had taught me to knit at 15, and I knitted in class throughout college and for a few years thereafter. Then decades passed without my touching a knitting needle. But within two Mondays in the group, I was hooked, not only on knitting but also on crocheting(钩织)，and I was on my way to becoming a highly productive crafter.
　　C) I’ve made countless baby blankets, sweaters, scarves, hats and caps for newborns. I take a knitting project with me everywhere, especially when I have to sit still and listen. As I discovered in college, when my hands are busy, my mind stays focused on the here and now.
　　D) It seems, too, that I’m part of a national renewal of interest in needle and other handicrafts(手工艺). The Craft Yarn Council reports that a third of women ages 25-35 now knit or crochet. Even men and schoolchildren are swelling the ranks, among them my friend’s three small grandsons. Last April, the council created a “Stitch Away Stress” campaign in honor of National Stress Awareness Month. Dr. Herbert Benson, a pioneer in mind/body medicine and author of The Relaxation Response, says that the repetitive action of needlework can induce a relaxed state like that associated with meditation(沉思)and yoga. Once you get beyond the initial learning curve, knitting and crocheting can lower heart rate and blood pressure.
　　E)But unlike meditation, craft activities result in tangible and often useful products that can enhance self-esteem. I keep photos of my singular accomplishments on my cellphone to boost my spirits when needed.
　　F) Since the 1990s, the council has surveyed hundreds of thousands of knitters and crocheters, who routinely list stress relief and creative fulfillment as the activities’ main benefits. Among them is the father of a prematurely born daughter who reported that during the baby’s five weeks in the intensive care unit, “learning how to knit infant hats gave me a sense of purpose during a time that I felt very helpless. It’s a hobby that I’ve stuck with, and it continues to help me cope with stress at work, provide a sense of order in hectic(忙乱的) days, and allow my brain time to solve problems.”
　　G) A recent email from the yarn(纺纱) company Red Heart titled “Health Benefits of Crocheting and Knitting” prompted me to explore what else might be known about the health value of activities like knitting. My research revealed that the rewards go well beyond replacing stress and anxiety with the satisfaction of creation.
　　H)For example, Karen Hayes, a life coach in Toronto, conducts knitting therapy programs, including Knit to Quit to help smokers give up the habit, and Knit to Heal for people coping with health crises, like a cancer diagnosis or serious illness of a family member. Schools and prisons with craft programs report that they have a calming effect and enhance social skills. And having to follow instructions on complex craft projects can improve children’s math skills.
　　I）Some people find that craftwork helps them control their weight. Just as it’s challenging to smoke while knitting, when hands are holding needles and hooks, there’s less snacking and mindless eating out of boredom.
　　J) I’ve found that my handiwork with yarn has helped my arthritic(患关节炎的) fingers remain more dexterous(灵巧的) as I age. A woman encouraged to try knitting and crocheting after developing an autoimmune disease that caused a lot of hand pain reported on the Craft Yarn Council site that her hands are now less stiff and painful.
　　K) A 2009 University of British Columbia study of 38 women with an eating disorder who were taught to knit found that learning the craft led to significant improvements. Seventy-four percent of the women said the activity lessened their fears and kept them from thinking about their problem.
　　L) Betsan Corkhill, a wellness coach in Bath, England, and author of the book Knit for Health & Wellness, established a website, Stitchlinks, to explore the value of what she calls therapeutic knitting. Among her respondents, 54 percent of those who were clinically depressed said that knitting made them feel happy or very happy. In a study of 60 self-selected people with persistent pain, Ms. Corkhill and colleagues reported that knitting enabled them to redirect their focus, reducing their awareness of pain. She suggested that the brain can process just so much at once, and that activities like knitting and crocheting make it harder for the brain to register pain signals. Perhaps most exciting is research that suggests that crafts like knitting and crocheting may help to keep off a decline in brain function with age. In a 2011 study, researchers led by Dr. Yonas Geda at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester interviewed a random(随机的) sample of 1,321 people ages 70-89, most of whom were cognitively(在认知方面) normal, about the cognitive activities they engaged in late in life. The study, published in the Journal of Neuropsychiatry & Clinical Neurosciences, found that those who engaged in crafts like knitting and crocheting had a diminished chance of  developing mild cognitive disorder and memory loss.
　　M）Although it is possible that only people who are cognitively healthy would pursue such activities, those who read newspapers or magazines or played music did not show similar benefits. The researchers speculate that craft activities promote the development of nerve pathways in the brain that help to maintain cognitive health.
　　N) In support of that suggestion, a 2014 study by Denise C. Park of the University of Texas at Dallas and colleagues demonstrated that learning to knit or do digital photography enhanced memory function in older adults. Those who engaged in activities that were not intellectually challenging, either in a social group or alone, did not show such improvements.
　　O) Given that sustained social contacts have been shown to support health and a long life, those wishing to maximize the health value of crafts might consider joining a group of like-minded folks. I for one try not to miss a single weekly meeting of my knitting group.
	36.When the author was a college student, she found that knitting helped her concentrate.
	37. Knitting can help people stay away from tobacco.
	38. Even men and children are now joining the army of knitters.
	39. Being a member of a crafts group enhances one’s health and prolongs one’s life.
	40. Knitting diverts people’s attention from their pain.
	41.The author learnt to knit as a teenager, but it was not until she was much older that she became keenly interested.
	42. When people are knitting, they tend to eat fewer snacks.
	43. Survey findings show that knitting can help people relieve stress.
	44. According to a study, knitters and crocheters are less likely to suffer mild cognitive damage.
	45. The products of knitting can increase one’s sense of self-respect.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　Nobody really knows how big Lagos is. What’s indisputable is that it’s growing very quickly Between now and 2050, the urban population of Africa could triple. Yet cities in sub-Saharan Africa are not getting richer the way cities in the rest of the world have. Most urban Africans live in slums(贫民窟); migrants are often not much better off than they were in the countryside. Why?
　　The immediate problem is poverty. Most of Africa is urbanizing at a lower level of income than other regions of the world did. That means there’s little money around for investment that would make cities liveable and more productive. Without upgrades and new capacity, bridges, roads and power systems are unable to cope with expanding populations. With the exception of South Africa, the only light rail metro system in sub-Saharan Africa is in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Traffic jam leads to expense and unpredictability, things that keep investors away.
　　In other parts of the world, increasing agricultural productivity and industrialization went together. More productive farmers meant there was a surplus that could feed cities; in turn, that created a pool of labour for factories. But African cities are different. They are too often built around consuming natural resources. Government is concentrated in capitals, so is the money. Most urban Africans work for a small minority of the rich, who tend to be involved in either cronyish(有裙带关系的)businesses or politics. Since African agriculture is still broadly unproductive, food is imported, consuming a portion of revenue.
　　So what can be done? Though African countries are poor, not all African cities are. In Lagos, foreign oil workers can pay as much as $ 65,000 per year in rent for a modest apartment in a safe part of town. If that income were better taxed, it might provide the revenue for better infrastructure. If city leaders were more accountable to their residents, they might favour projects designed to help them more. Yet even as new roads are built, new people arrive. When a city’s population grows by 5% a year, it is difficult to keep up.
46. What do we learn from the passage about cities in sub-Saharan Africa?
　　A) They have more slums than other cities in the world.
　　B) They are growing fast without becoming richer.
　　C) They are as modernized as many cities elsewhere.
　　D) They attract migrants who want to be better off.
47. What does the author imply about urbanization in other parts of the world?
　　A) It benefited from the contribution of immigrants.
　　B) It started when people’s income was relatively high.
　　C) It benefited from the accelerated rise in productivity.
　　D) It started with the improvement of people’s livelihood.
48. Why is sub-Saharan Africa unappealing to investors?
　　A) It lacks adequate transport facilities.
　　B)The living expenses there are too high.
　　C) It is on the whole too densely populated.
　　D)The local governments are corrupted.
49. In what way does the author say African cities are different?
　　A) They have attracted huge numbers of farm labourers.
　　B) They still rely heavily on agricultural productivity.
　　C) They have developed at the expense of nature.
　　D) They depend far more on foreign investment.
50. What might be a solution to the problems facing African cities?
　　A)Lowering of apartment rent.
　　B)Better education for residents.
　　C) More rational overall planning.
　　D) A more responsible government.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　For the past several decades, it seems there’s been a general consensus on how to get ahead in America: Get a college education, find a reliable job, and buy your own home. But do Americans still believe in that path, and if they do, is it attainable?
　　The most recent National Journal poll asked respondents about the American dream, what it takes to achieve their goals, and whether or not they felt a significant amount of control over their ability to be successful. Overwhelmingly, the results show that today, the idea of the American dream—and what it takes to achieve it—looks quite different than it did in the late 20th century.
　　By and large, people felt that their actions and hard work—not outside forces—were the deciding factor in how their lives turned out. But respondents had decidedly mixed feelings about what actions make for a better life in current economy.
　　In the last seven years, Americans have grown more pessimistic about the power of education to lead to success. Even though they see going to college as a fairly achievable goal, a majority—52 percent—think that young people do not need a four-year college education in order to be successful.
　　Miguel Maeda, 42, who has a master’s degree and works in public health, was the first in his family to go to college, which has allowed him to achieve a sense of financial stability his parents and grandparents never did.
　　While some, like Maeda, emphasized the value of the degree rather than the education itself, others still see college as a way to gain new perspectives and life experiences.
　　Sixty-year-old Will Fendley, who had a successful career in the military and never earned a college degree, thinks “personal drive” is far more important than just going to college. To Fendley, a sense of drive and purpose, as well as an effective high-school education, and basic life skills, like balancing a checkbook, are the necessary ingredients for a successful life in America.
51. It used to be commonly acknowledged that to succeed in America, one had to have          .
　　A) an advanced academic degree		B)an ambition to get ahead
　　C) a firm belief in their dream		D) a sense of drive and purpose
52. What is the finding of the latest National Journal poll concerning the American dream?
　　A) More and more Americans are finding it hard to realize.
　　B) It remains alive among the majority of American people.
　　C) Americans’ idea of it has changed over the past few decades.
　　D)An increasing number of young Americans are abandoning it.
53.What do Americans now think of the role of college education in achieving success?
　　A)It still remains open to debate.				B) It has proved to be beyond doubt.
　　C) It is no longer as important as it used to be.	D) It is much better understood now than ever.
54.How do some people view college education these days?
　　A) It promotes gender equality.	 		B) It needs to be strengthened.
　　C) It adds to cultural diversity.		 	D) It helps broaden their minds.
55. What is one factor essential to success in America, according to Will Fendley?
　　A) A desire to learn and to adapt.			B) A strong sense of responsibility.
　　C) A willingness to commit oneself.		D) A clear aim and high motivation.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
    	We all know there exists a great void（空白）in the public educational system when it comes to    26  to STEM（Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics）courses. One educator named Dori Roberts decided to do something to change this system. Dori taught high school engineering for 11 years. She noticed there was a real void in quality STEM education at all   27  of the public educational system. She said, “I started Engineering For Kids (EFK)after noticing a real lack of math, science and engineering programs to  28  my own kids in.”
　　She decided to start an afterschool program where children    29   in STEM-based competitions. The club grew quickly and when it reached 180 members and the kids in the program won several state   30  , she decided to devote all her time to cultivating and    31  it. The global business EFK was born.
　　Dori began operating EFK out of her Virginia home, which she then expanded to  32    recreation centers. Today, the EFK program    33   over 144 branches in 32 states within the United States and in 21 countries. Sales have doubled from $5 million in 2014 to $10 million in 2015,with 25 new branches planned for 2016. The EFK website states, “Our nation is not  34   enough engineers. Our philosophy is to inspire kids at a young age to understand that engineering is a great   35  .”

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
　　Why aren't you curious about what happened?
A) “You suspended Ray Rice after our video,” a reporter from TMZ challenged National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell the other day. “Why didn’t you have the curiosity to go to the casino (赌场) yourself?” The implication of the question is that a more curious. commissioner would have found a way to get the tape.
B) The accusation of incuriosity is one that we hear often, carrying the suggestion that there is something wrong with not wanting to search out the truth. “I have been bothered for a long time about the curious lack of curiosity,” said a Democratic member of the New Jersey legislature back in July, referring to an insufficiently inquiring attitude on the part of an assistant to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who chose not to ask hard questions about the George Washington Bridge traffic scandal. “Isn’t the mainstream media the least bit curious about what happened?” wrote conservative writer Jennifer Rubin earlier this year, referring to the attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya.
C) The implication, in each case, is that curiosity is a good thing, and a lack of curiosity is a problem. Are such accusations simply efforts to score political points for one's party? Or is there something of particular value about curiosity in and of itself?
D) The journalist Ian Leslie, in his new and enjoyable book Curious: The Desire to Know and Why Your Fatter Depends on It, insists that the answer to that last question is ‘Yes.’ Leslie argues that curiosity is a much-overlooked human virtue, crucial to our success, and that we are losing it.
E)We are suffering, he writes, from a “serendipity deficit.” The word “serendipity” was coined by Horace Walpole in an 1854 letter, from a tale of three princes who “were always making discoveries, by accident, of things they were not in search of,” Leslie worries that the rise of the Internet, among other social and technological changes, has reduced our appetite for aimless adventures. No longer have we the inclination to let ourselves wander through fields of know ledges, ready to be surprised. Instead, we seek only the information we want.
F) Why is this a problem? Because without curiosity we will lose the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship. We will see unimaginative governments and dying corporations make disastrous decisions. We will lose a vital part of what has made humanity as a whole so successful as a species.
G) Leslie presents considerable evidence for the proposition that the society as a whole is growing less curious. In the U.S. and Europe, for example, the rise of the Internet has led to a declining consumption of news from outside the reader’s borders .But not everything is to be blamed on technology. The decline in interest in literary fiction is also one of the causes identified by Leslie. Reading literary fiction, he says ,makes us more curious.
H)Moreover, in order to  be curious, “you have to be aware of a gap in your knowledge in the first place.” Although Leslie perhaps paints a bit broadly in contending that most of us are unaware of how much we don’t know, he’s surely right to point out that the problem is growing: “Google can give us the powerful illusion that all questions have definite answers.”
I）Indeed, Google, for which Leslie expresses admiration, is also his frequent whipping body(替罪羊). He quotes Google co-founder Larry Page to the effect that the “perfect search engine” will “understand exactly what I mean and give me back exactly what I want.” Elsewhere in the book, Leslie writes: “Google aims to save you from the thirst of curiosity altogether.”
J) Somewhat nostalgically(怀旧地), he quotes John Maynard Keynes’s justly famous words of praise to the bookstore: “One should enter it vaguely, almost in a dream, and allow what is there freely to attract and influence the eye. To walk the rounds of the bookshops, dipping in as curiosity dictates, should be an afternoons entertainment.” If only!
K) Citing the work of psychologists and cognitive( 认知的)scientists, Leslie criticizes the received wisdom that academic success is the result of a combination of intellectual talent and hard work. Curiosity, he argues, is the third key factor--and a difficult one to preserve. If not cultivated, it will not survive: “Childhood curiosity is a collaboration between child and adult. The surest way to kill it is to leave it alone.”
L) School education, he warns, is often conducted in a way that makes children incurious. Children of educated and upper-middle-class parents turn out to be far more curious, even at early ages, than children of working class and lower class families. That lack of curiosity produces a relative lack of knowledge, and the lack of knowledge is difficult if not impossible to compensate for later on.
M）Although Leslie’s book isn’t about politics, he doesn’t entirely shy away from the problem. Political leaders, like leaders of other organizations, should be curious. They should ask questions at crucial moments . There serious consequences, he warns, in not wanting to know.
N) He presents as an example the failure of the George W. Bush administration to prepare properly for the after-effects of the invasion of Iraq. According to Leslie, those who ridiculed former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for his 2002 remark that we have to be wary of the “unknown unknowns” were mistaken. Rumsfeld’s idea, Leslie writes, “wasn’t absurd- it was smart.” He adds, “The tragedy is that he didn’t follow his own advice.”
O) All of which brings us back to Goodell and the Christie case and Benghazi. Each critic in those examples is charging, in a different way, that someone in authority is intentionally being incurious. I leave it to the reader's political preference to decide which, if any, charges should stick. But let’s be careful about demanding curiosity about the other side’s weaknesses and remaining determinedly incurious about our own. We should be delighted to pursue knowledge for its own sake—even when what we find out is something we didn’t particularly want to know.
36. To be curious, we need to realize first of all that there are many things we don’t know.
37. According to Leslie, curiosity is essential to one’s success.
38. We should feel happy when we pursue knowledge for knowledge’s sake.
39. Political leaders’ lack of curiosity will result in bad consequences.
40. There are often accusations about politicians' and the media’s lack of curiosity to find out the truth.
41. The less curious a child is, the less knowledge the child may turn out to have.
42. It is widely accepted that academic accomplishment lies in both intelligence and diligence.
43. Visiting a bookshop as curiosity leads us can be a good way to entertain ourselves.
44. Both the rise of the Internet and reduced appetite for literary fiction contribute to people’s declining curiosity.
45. Mankind wouldn’t be so innovative without curiosity.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　Aging happens to all of us, and is generally thought of as a natural part of life. It would seem silly to call such a thing a “disease.”
　　On the other hand, scientists are increasingly learning that aging and biological age are two different things, and that the former is a key risk factor for conditions such as heart disease, cancer and many more. In that light, aging itself might be seen as something treatable, the way you would treat high blood pressure or a vitamin deficiency.
　　Biophysicist Alex Zhavoronkov believes that aging should be considered a disease. He said that describing aging as a disease creates incentives to develop treatments.
　　“It unties the hands of the pharmaceutical(制药的)industry so that they can begin treating the disease and not just the side effects,” he said. 
　　“Right now, people think of aging as natural and something you can’t control,” he said. “In academic circles, people take aging research as just an interest area where they can try to develop interventions. The medical community also takes aging for granted, and can do nothing about it except keep people within a certain health range.”
　　But if aging were recognized as a disease, he said, “It would attract funding and change the way we do health care. What matters is understanding that aging is curable.”
　　“It was always known that the body accumulates damage,” he added. “The only way to cure aging is to find ways to repair that damage. I think of it as preventive medicine for age-related conditions.”
　　Leonard Hayflick, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, said the idea that aging can be cured implies the human lifespan can be increased, which some researchers suggest is possible. Hayflick is not among them.
　　“There’re many people who recover from cancer, stroke, or heart disease. But they continue to age, because aging is separate from their disease,” Hayflick said. “Even if those causes of death were eliminated, life expectancy would still not go much beyond 92 years.”
　　
46. What do people generally believe about aging?
　　A) It should cause no alarm whatsoever.
　　B)They just cannot do anything about it.
　　C) It should be regarded as a kind of disease.
　　D)They can delay it with advances in science.
47. How do many scientists view aging now?
　　A) It might be prevented and treated.
　　B) It can be as risky as heart disease.
　　C) It results from a vitamin deficiency.
　　D)It is an irreversible biological process.
48. What does Alex Zhavoronkov think of “describing aging as a disease”?
　　A) It will prompt people to take aging more seriously.
　　B) It will greatly help reduce the side effects of aging.
　　C) It will free pharmacists from the conventional beliefs about aging.
　　D)It will motivate doctors and pharmacists to find ways to treat aging.
49. What do we learn about the medical community?
　　A) They now have a strong interest in research on aging.
　　B) They differ from the academic circles in their view on aging.
　　C)They can contribute to people’s health only to a limited extent.
　　D) They have ways to intervene in people’s aging process.
50. What does Professor Leonard Hayflick believe?
　　A)The human lifespan cannot be prolonged.
　　B)Aging is hardly separable from disease.
　　C) Few people can live up to the age of 92.
　　D) Heart disease is the major cause of aging.
　　
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage
　　Female applicants to postdoctoral positions in geosciences were nearly half as likely to receive excellent letters of recommendation, compared with their male counterparts. Christopher Intagliata reports.
　　As in many other fields, gender bias is widespread in the sciences. Men score higher starting salaries, have more mentoring (指导), and have better odds of being hired. Studies show they’re also perceived as more competent than women in STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. And new research reveals that men are more likely to receive excellent letters of recommendation, too.
　　“Say, you know, this is the best student I’ve ever had,” says Kuheli Dutt, a social scientist and diversity officer at Columbia University’s Lamont campus. “Compare those excellent letters with a merely good letter: ‘The candidate was productive, or intelligent, or a solid scientist or something that’s clearly solid praise,’ but nothing that singles out the candidate as exceptional or one of a kind.”
　　Dutt and her colleagues studied more than 1,200 letters of recommendation for postdoctoral positions in geoscience. They were all edited for gender and other identifying information, so Dutt and her team could assign them a score without knowing the gender of the student. They found that female applicants were only half as likely to get outstanding letters, compared with their male counterparts. That includes letters of recommendation from all over the world, and written by, yes,  men and women. The findings are in the journal Nature Geoscience.
　　Dutt says they were not able to evaluate the actual scientific qualifications of the applicants using the data in the files. But she says the results still suggest women in geoscience are at a potential disadvantage from the very beginning of their careers starting with those less than outstanding letters of recommendation.
　　“We’re not trying to assign blame or criticize anyone or call anyone consciously sexist. Rather, the point is to use the results of this study to open up meaningful dialogues on implicit gender bias, be it at a departmental level or an institutional level or even a discipline level.” Which may lead to some recommendations for the letter writers themselves.
　　
51. What do we learn about applicants to postdoctoral positions in geosciences?
　　A) There are many more men applying than women.
　　B)Chances for women to get the positions are scarce.
　　C) More males than females are likely to get outstanding letters of recommendation.
　　D) Male applicants have more interest in these positions than their female counterparts.
52. What do studies about men and women in scientific research show?
　　A) Women engaged in postdoctoral work are quickly catching up.
　　B) Fewer women are applying for postdoctoral positions due to gender bias.
　　C) Men are believed to be better able to excel in STEM disciplines.
　　D)Women who are keenly interested in STEM fields are often exceptional.
53.What do the studies find about the recommendation letters for women applicants?
　　A)They are hardly ever supported by concrete examples.
　　B)They contain nothing that distinguishes the applicants.
　　C) They provide objective information without exaggeration.
　　D)They are often filled with praise for exceptional applicants.
54.What did Dutt and her colleagues do with the more than 1, 200 letters of recommendation?
　　A)They asked unbiased scholars to evaluate them.
　　B)They invited women professionals to edit them.
　　C)They assigned them randomly to reviewers.
　　D) They deleted all information about gender.
55. What does Dutt aim to do with her study?
　　A) Raise recommendation writers’ awareness of gender bias in their letters.
　　B)Open up fresh avenues for women post-doctors to join in research work.
　　C) Alert women researchers to all types of gender bias in the STEM disciplines.
　　D) Start a public discussion on how to raise women’s status in academic circles.

Some College Students Are Angry That They Have to Pay to Do Their Homework
A) Digital learning systems now charge students for access codes needed to complete coursework, take quizzes, and turn in homework. As universities go digital, students are complaining of a new hit to their finances that's replacing—and sometimes joining—expensive textbooks: pricey online access codes that are required to complete coursework and submit assignments.
B) The codes—which typically range in price from $ 80 to $ 155 per course—give students online access to systems developed by education companies like McGraw Hill and Pearson. These companies, which long reaped big profits as textbook publishers, have boasted that their new online offerings, when pushed to students through universities they partner with, represent the future of the industry.
C) But critics say the digital access codes represent the same profit-seeking ethos (观念) of the textbook business, and are even harder for students to opt out of. While they could once buy second-hand textbooks, or share copies with friends, the digital systems are essentially impossible to avoid.
D) "When we talk about the access code we see it as the new face of the textbook monopoly (垄断), a new way to lock students around this system," said Ethan Senack, the higher education advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, to BuzzFeed News. "Rather than $250 (for a print textbook) you're paying $ 120," said Senack. "But because it's all digital it eliminates the used book market and eliminates any sharing and because homework and tests are through an access code, it eliminates any ability to opt out."
E) Sarina Harpet, a 19-year-old student at Virginia Tech, was faced with a tough dilemma when she first started college in 2015—pay rent or pay to turn in her chemistry homework. She told BuzzFeed News that her freshman chemistry class required her to use Connect, a system provided by McGraw Hill where students can submit homework, take exams and track their grades. But the code to access the program cost $ 120—a big sum for Harper, who had already put down $ 450 for textbooks, and had rent day approaching.
F) She decided to wait for her next work-study paycheck, which was typically $ 150- $ 200, to pay for the code. She knew that her chemistry grade may take a dive as a result. "It's a balancing act," she said. "Can I really afford these access codes now?" She didn't hand in her first two assignments for chemistry, which started her out in the class with a failing grade.
G) The access codes may be another financial headache for students, but for textbook businesses, they're the future. McGraw Hill, which controls 21% of the higher education market, reported in March that its digital content sales exceeded print sales for the first time in 2015. The company said that 45% of its $ 140 million revenue in 2015 "was derived from digital products."
H) A Pearson spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that "digital materials are less expensive and a good investment" that offer new features, like audio texts, personalized knowledge checks and expert videos. Its digital course materials save students up to 60% compared to traditional printed textbooks, the company added. McGraw Hill didn't respond to a request for comment, but its CEO David Levin told the Financial Times in August that "in higher education, the era of the printed textbook is now over."
I) The textbook industry insists the online systems represent a better deal for students. "These digital products aren't just mechanisms for students to submit homework, they offer all kinds of features," David Anderson, the executive director of higher education with the Association of American Publishers, told BuzzFeed News. "It helps students understand in a way that you can't do with print homework assignments."
J) David Hunt, an associate professor in sociology at Augusta University, which has rolled out digital textbooks across its math and psychology departments, told BuzzFeed News that he understands the utility of using systems that require access codes. But he doesn't require his students to buy access to a learning program that controls the class assignments. "I try to make things as inexpensive as possible," said Hunt, who uses free digital textbooks for his classes but designs his own curriculum. "The online systems may make my life a lot easier but I feel like I'm giving up control. The discussions are the things where my expertise can benefit the students most."
K) A 20-year-old junior at Georgia Southern University told BuzzFeed News that she normally spends $ 500-$ 600 on access codes for class. In one case, the professor didn't require students to buy a textbook, just an access code to turn in homework. This year she said she spent $ 900 on access codes to books and programs. "That's two months of rent," she said. "You can't sell any of it back. With a traditional textbook you can sell it for $ 30 - $ 50 and that helps to pay for your new semester's books. With an access code, you're out of that money. "
L) Benjamin Wolverton, a 19-year-old student at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News that "it's ridiculous that after paying tens of thousands in tuition we have to pay for all these access codes to do our homework." Many of the access codes he's purchased have been required simply to complete homework or quizzes. "Often it's only 10% of your grade in class." he said. "You're paying so much money for something that hardly affects your grade—but if you didn't have it, it would affect your grade enough. It would be bad to start out at a B or C." Wolverton said he spent $ 500 on access codes for digital books and programs this semester.
M) Harper, a poultry (家禽) science major, is taking chemistry again this year and had to buy a new access code to hand in her homework. She rented her economics and statistics textbooks for about $ 20 each. But her access codes for homework, which can't be rented or bought second-hand, were her most expensive purchases: $ 120 and $ 85.
N) She still remembers the sting of her first experience skipping an assignment due to the high prices. "We don't really have a missed assignment policy," she said. "If you miss it, you just miss it. I just got zeros on a couple of first assignments. I managed to pull everything back up. But as a scared freshman looking at their grades, it's not fun."
36. A student's yearly expenses on access codes may amount to their rent for two months.
37. The online access codes may be seen as a way to tie the students to the digital system.
38. If a student takes a course again, they may have to buy a new access code to submit their assignments.
39. McGraw Hill accounts for over one-fifth of the market share of college textbooks.
40. Many traditional textbook publishers are now offering online digital products, which they believe will be the future of the publishing business.
41. One student complained that they now had to pay for access codes in addition to the high tuition.
42. Digital materials can cost students less than half the price of traditional printed books according to a publisher.
43. One student decided not to buy her access code until she received the pay for her part-time job.
44. Online systems may deprive teachers of opportunities to make the best use of their expertise for their students.
45. Digital access codes are criticized because they are profit-driven just like the textbook business.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 and 50 are based on the following passage.
　　Losing your ability to think and remember is pretty scary. We know the risk of dementia (痴呆症) increases with age. But if you have memory slips, you probably needn't worry. There are pretty clear differences between signs of dementia and age-related memory loss.
　　After age 50, it's quite common to have trouble remembering the names of people, places and things quickly, says Dr. Kirk Daffner of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
　　The brain ages just like the rest of the body. Certain parts shrink, especially areas in the brain that are important to learning, memory and planning. Changes in brain cells can affect communication between different regions of the brain. And blood flow can be reduced as blood vessels narrow.
　　Forgetting the name of an actor in a favorite movie, for example, is nothing to worry about. But if you forget the plot of the movie or don't remember even seeing it, that's far more concerning, Daffner says.
　　When you forget entire experiences, he says, that's "a red flag that something more serious may be involved." Forgetting how to operate a familiar object like a microwave oven, or forgetting how to drive to the house of a friend you've visited many times before can also be signs of something going wrong.
　　But even then, Daffner says, people shouldn't panic. There are many things that can cause confusion and memory loss, including health problems like temporary stoppage of breathing during sleep, high blood pressure, or depression, as well as medications (药物) like antidepressants.
　　You don't have to figure this out on your own. Daffner suggests going to your doctor to check on medications, health problems and other issues that could be affecting memory. And the best defense against memory loss is to try to prevent it by building up your brain's cognitive (认知的) reserve, Daffner says.
　　"Read books, go to movies, take on new hobbies or activities that force one to think in novel ways," he says. In other words, keep your brain busy and working. And also get physically active, because exercise is a known brain booster.
46.Why does the author say that one needn't be concerned about memory slips?
	A.Not all of them are symptoms of dementia.
	B.They occur only among certain groups of people.
	C.Not all of them are related to one's age.
	D.They are quite common among fifty-year-olds.
47.What happens as we become aged according to the passage?
	A.Our interaction skills deteriorate. 
	B.Some parts of our brain stop functioning.
	C.Communication within our brain weakens.
	D.Our whole brain starts shrinking.
48.Which memory-related symptom should people take seriously?
	A.Totally forgetting how to do one's daily routines.
	B.Inability to recall details of one's life experiences.
	C.Failure to remember the names of movies or actors.
	D.Occasionally confusing the addresses of one's friends.
49.What should people do when signs of serious memory loss show up?
	A.Check the brain's cognitive reserve. 
	B.Stop medications affecting memory. 
	C.Turn to a professional for assistance.
	D.Exercise to improve their well-being.
50.What is Dr. Daffner's advice for combating memory loss?
	A.Having regular physical and mental checkups.
	B.Taking medicine that helps boost one's brain.
	C.Engaging in known memory repair activities.
	D.Staying active both physically and mentally.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　A letter written by Charles Darwin in 1875 has been returned to the Smithsonian Institution Archives (档案馆) by the FBI after being stolen twice.
　　"We realized in the mid-1970s that it was missing," says Effie Kapsalis, head of the Smithsonian Institution Archives. "It was noted as missing and likely taken by an intern (实习生), from what the FBI is telling us. Word got out that it was missing when someone asked to see the letter for research purposes," and the intern put the letter back. "The intern likely took the letter again once nobody was watching it."
　　Decades passed. Finally, the FBI received a tip that the stolen document was located very close to Washington, D.C. Their art crime team recovered the letter but were unable to press charges because the time of limitations had ended. The FBI worked closely with the Archives to determine that the letter was both authentic and definitely Smithsonian's property.
　　The letter was written by Darwin to thank an American geologist, Dr. Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, for sending him copies of his research into the geology of the region that would become Yellowstone National Park.
　　The letter is in fairly good condition, in spite of being out of the care of trained museum staff for so long. "It was luckily in good shape," says Kapsalis, "and we just have to do some minor things in order to be able to unfold it. It has some glue on it that has colored it slightly, but nothing that will prevent us from using it. After it is repaired, we will take digital photos of it and that will be available online. One of our goals is to get items of high research value or interest to the public online."
　　It would now be difficult for an intern, visitor or a thief to steal a document like this. "Archiving practices have changed greatly since the 1970s," says Kapsalis, "and we keep our high value documents in a safe that I don't even have access to."
51.What happened to Darwin's letter in the 1970s?
	A.It was recovered by the FBI.
	B.It was stolen more than once.
	C.It was put in the archives for research purposes.
	D.It was purchased by the Smithsonian Archives.
52.What did the FBI do after the recovery of the letter?
	A.They proved its authenticity. 
	B.They kept it in a special safe.
	C.They arrested the suspect immediately.
	D.They pressed criminal charges in vain.
53.What is Darwin's letter about?
	A.The evolution of Yellowstone National Park.
	B.His cooperation with an American geologist.
	C.Some geological evidence supporting his theory.
	D.His acknowledgement of help from a professional.
54.What will the Smithsonian Institution Archives do with the letter according to Kapsalis?
	A.Reserve it for research purposes only. 
	B.Turn it into an object of high interest.
	C.Keep it a permanent secret. 
	D.Make it available online.
55.What has the past half century witnessed according to Kapsalis?
	A.Growing interest in rare art objects.
	B.Radical changes in archiving practices.
	C.Recovery of various missing documents.
	D.Increases in the value of museum exhibits.

As Tourists Crowd Out Locals, Venice Faces 'Endangered' List
　　　A) On a recent fall morning, a large crowd blocked the steps at one of Venice's main tourist sites, the Rialto Bridge. The Rialto Bridge is one of the four bridges spanning the Grand Canal. It is the oldest bridge across the canal, and was the dividing line between the districts of San Marco and San Polo. But on this day, there was a twist: it was filled with Venetians, not tourists.
　　　B) "People are cheering and holding their carts in the air," says Giovanni Giorgio, who helped organize the march with a grass-roots organization called Generazione '90. The carts he refers to are small shopping carts—the symbol of a true Venetian. "It started as a joke," he says with a laugh. "The idea was to put blades on the wheels! You know? Like Ben Hur. Precisely like that, you just go around and run people down."
　　　C) Venice is one of the hottest tourist destinations in the world. But that's a problem. Up to 90,000 tourists crowd its streets and canals every day—far outnumbering the 55,000 permanent residents. The tourist increase is one key reason the city's population is down from 175,000 in the 1950s. The outnumbered Venetians have been steadily fleeing. And those who stick around are tired of living in a place where they can't even get to the market without swimming through a sea of picture-snapping tourists. Imagine, navigating through 50,000 people while on the way to school or to work.
　　　D) Laura Chigi, a grandmother at the march, says the local and national governments have failed to do anything about the crowds for decades, because they're only interested in tourism—the primary industry in Venice, worth more than $3 billion in 2015. "Venice is a cash cow," she says, "and everyone wants a piece."
　　　E) Just beyond St. Mark's Square, a cruise ship passes, one of hundreds every year that appear over their medieval (中世纪的) surroundings. Their massive wake creates waves at the bottom of the sea, weakening the foundations of the centuries-old buildings themselves. "Every time I see a cruise ship, I feel sad," Chigi says. "You see the mud it drags; the destruction it leaves in its wake? That hurts the ancient wooden poles holding up the city underwater. One day we'll see Venice break down."
　　　F) For a time, UNESCO, the cultural wing of the United Nations, seemed to agree. Two years ago, it put Italy on notice, saying the government was not protecting Venice. UNESCO considers the entire city a World Heritage Site, a great honor that means Venice, at the cultural level, belongs to all of the world's people. In 2014, UNESCO gave Italy two years to manage Venice's flourishing tourism or the city would be placed on another list—World Heritage In Danger, joining such sites as Aleppo and Palmyra, destroyed by the war in Syria.
　　　G) Venice's deadline passed with barely a murmur (嘟哝) this summer, just as UNESCO was meeting in Istanbul. Only one representative, Jad Tabet from Lebanon, tried to raise the issue. "For several years, the situation of heritage in Venice has been worsening, and it has now reached a dramatic situation," Tabet told UNESCO. "We have to act quickly—there is not a moment to waste."
　　　H) But UNESCO didn't even hold a vote. "It's been postponed until 2017," says Anna Somers, the founder and CEO of The Art Newspaper and the former head of Venice in Peril, a group devoted to restoring Venetian art. She says the main reason the U.N. cultural organization didn't vote to declare Venice a World Heritage Site In Danger is because UNESCO has become "intensely politicized. There would have been some back-room negotiations."
　　　I) Italy boasts more UNESCO World Heritage Sites than any other country in the world, granting it considerable power and influence within the organization. The former head of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, which oversees heritage sites, is Francesco Bandarin, a Venetian who now serves as UNESCO's assistant director-general for culture.
　　　J) Earlier this year, Italy signed an accord with UNESCO to establish a task force of police art detectives and archaeologists (考古学家) to protect cultural heritage from natural disasters and terror groups, such as ISIS. The accord underlined Italy's global reputation as a good steward of art and culture.
　　　K) But adding Venice to the UNESCO endangered list—which is dominated by sites in developing and conflict-ridden countries—would be an international embarrassment, and could even hurt Italy's profitable tourism industry. The Italian Culture Ministry says it is unaware of any government efforts to pressure UNESCO. As for the organization itself, it declined a request for an interview.
　　　L) The city's current mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, has ridiculed UNESCO and told it to mind its own business, while continuing to support the cruise ship industry, which employs 5,000 Venice residents.
　　　M) As for Venetians, they're beyond frustrated and hoping for a solution soon. "It's a nightmare for me. Some situations are really difficult with tourists around," says Giorgio as he navigates around a swelling crowd at the Rialto Bridge. "There are just so many of them. They never know where they are going, and do not walk in an orderly manner. Navigating the streets can be exhausting."
　　　N) Then it hits him: This crowd isn't made up of tourists. They're Venetians. Giorgio says he's never experienced the Rialto Bridge this way in all his 22 years. "For once, we are the ones who are blocking the traffic," he says delightedly. "It feels unreal. It feels like we're some form of endangered species. It's just nice. The feeling is just pure." But, he worries, if tourism isn't managed and his fellow locals continue to move to the mainland, his generation might be the last who can call themselves native Venetians.
　　36. The passing cruise ships will undermine the foundations of the ancient buildings in Venice.
　　37. The Italian government has just reached an agreement with UNESCO to take measures to protect its cultural heritage.
　　38. The heritage situation in Venice has been deteriorating in the past few years.
　　39. The decrease in the number of permanent residents in Venice is mainly due to the increase of tourists.
　　40. If tourism gets out of control, native Venetians may desert the city altogether one day.
　　41. UNESCO urged the Italian government to undertake its responsibility to protect Venice.
　　42. The participants in the Venetian march used shopping carts to show they were 100% local residents.
　　43. Ignoring UNESCO's warning, the mayor of Venice maintains his support of the city's tourism industry.
　　44. One woman says that for decades the Italian government and local authorities have only focused on the revenues from tourism.
　　45. UNESCO has not yet decided to put Venice on the list of World Heritage Sites In Danger.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 and 50 are based on the following passage.
　　Living in an urban area with green spaces has a long-lasting positive impact on people's mental well-being, a study has suggested. UK researchers found moving to a green space had a sustained positive effect, unlike pay rises or promotions, which only provided a short-term boost. Co-author Mathew White, from the University of Exeter, UK, explained that the study showed people living in greener urban areas were displaying fewer signs of depression or anxiety. "There could be a number of reasons," he said, "for example, people do many things to make themselves happier: they strive for promotion or pay rises, or they get married. But the trouble with those things is that within six months to a year, people are back to their original baseline levels of well-being. So, these things are not sustainable; they don't make us happy in the long term. We found that for some lottery (彩票) winners who had won more than ￡500,000 the positive effect was definitely there, but after six months to a year, they were back to the baseline."
　　Dr. White said his team wanted to see whether living in greener urban areas had a lasting positive effect on people's sense of well-being or whether the effect also disappeared after a period of time. To do this, the team used data from the British Household Panel Survey compiled by the University of Essex.
　　Explaining what the data revealed, he said: "What you see is that even after three years, mental health is still better, which is unlike many other things that we think will make us happy." He observed that people living in green spaces were less stressed, and less stressed people made more sensible decisions and communicated better.
　　With a growing body of evidence establishing a link between urban green spaces and a positive impact on human well-being, Dr. White said, "There's growing interest among public policy officials, but the trouble is who funds it. What we really need at a policy level is to decide where the money will come from to help support good quality local green spaces."
46.According to one study, what do green spaces do to people?
	A.Improve their work efficiency.
	B.Add to their sustained happiness.
	C.Help them build a positive attitude towards life.
	D.Lessen their concerns about material well-being.
47.What does Dr. White say people usually do to make themselves happier?
	A.Earn more money.		B.Settle in an urban area. 
	C.Gain fame and popularity.	D.Live in a green environment.
48.What does Dr. White try to find out about living in a greener urban area?
	A.How it affects different people.	B.How strong its positive effect is. 
	C.How long its positive effect lasts.	D.How it benefits people physically.
49.What did Dr. White's research reveal about people living in a green environment?
	A.Their stress was more apparent than real.	B.Their decisions required less deliberation.
	C.Their memories were greatly strengthened.	D.Their communication with others improved.
50.According to Dr. White, what should the government do to build more green spaces in cities?
	A.Find financial support. 	B.Improve urban planning.
	C.Involve local residents in the effort.	D.Raise public awareness of the issue.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　You probably know about the Titanic, but it was actually just one of three state-of-the-art (先进的) ocean ships back in the day. The Olympic class ships were built by the Harland & Wolff ship makers in Northern Ireland for the White Star Line company. The Olympic class included the Olympic, the Britannic and the Titanic. What you may not know is that the Titanic wasn't even the flagship of this class. All in all, the Olympic class ships were marvels of sea engineering, but they seemed cursed to suffer disastrous fates.
　　The Olympic launched first in 1910, followed by the Titanic in 1911, and lastly the Britannic in 1914. The ships had nine decks, and White Star Line decided to focus on making them the most luxurious ships on the water.
　　Stretching 269.13 meters, the Olympic class ships were wonders of naval technology, and everyone thought that they would continue to be so for quite some time. However, all suffered terrible accidents on the open seas. The Olympic got wrecked before the Titanic did, but it was the only one to survive and maintain a successful career of 24 years. The Titanic was the first to sink after famously hitting a huge iceberg in 1912. Following this disaster, the Britannic hit a naval mine in 1916 and subsequently sank as well.
　　Each ship was coal-powered by several boilers constantly kept running by exhausted crews below deck. Most recognizable of the ship designs are the ship's smoke stacks, but the fourth stack was actually just artistic in nature and served no functional purpose. While two of these ships sank, they were all designed with double hulls (船体) believed to make them "unsinkable", perhaps a mistaken idea that led to the Titanic's and the Britannic's tragic end.
　　The Olympic suffered two crashes with other ships and went on to serve as a hospital ship and troop transport in World War I. Eventually, she was taken out of service in 1935, ending the era of the luxurious Olympic class ocean liners.
51.What does the passage say about the three Olympic class ships?
	A.They performed marvellously on the sea.	B.They could all break the ice in their way.
	C.They all experienced terrible misfortunes.	D.They were models of modern engineering.
52.What did White Star Line have in mind when it purchased the three ships?
	A.Their capacity of sailing across all waters.	B.The utmost comfort passengers could enjoy.
	C.Their ability to survive disasters of any kind.	D.The long voyages they were able to undertake.
53.What is said about the fourth stack of the ships?
	A.It was a mere piece of decoration.	B.It was the work of a famous artist. 
	C.It was designed to let out extra smoke.	D.It was easily identifiable from afar.
54.What might have led to the tragic end of the Titanic and the Britannic?
	A.Their unscientific designs.
	B.Their captains' misjudgment.
	C.The assumption that they were built with the latest technology.
	D.The belief that they could never sink with a double-layer body.
55.What happened to the ship Olympic in the end?
	A.She was used to carry troops.	B.She was sunk in World War I. 
	C.She was converted into a hospital ship.	D.She was retired after her naval service.

　　Neon (霓虹) is to Hong Kong as red phone booths are to London and fog is to San Francisco. When night falls, red and blue and other colors  26  a hazy (雾蒙蒙的) glow over a city lit up by tens of thousands of neon signs. But many of them are going dark,  27   by more practical, but less romantic, LEDs (发光二极管).
　　Changing building codes, evolving tastes, and the high cost of maintaining those wonderful old signs have businesses embracing LEDs, which are energy  28   , but still carry great cost. "To me, neon represents memories of the past," says photographer Sharon Blance, whose series Hong Kong Neon celebrates the city's famous signs. "Looking at the signs now I get a feeling of amazement, mixed with sadness."
　　Building a neon sign is an art practiced by  29   trained on the job to mold glass tubes into  30   shapes and letters. They fill these tubes with gases that glow when  31  . Neon makes orange, while other gases make yellow or blue. It takes many hours to craft a single sign.
　　Blance spent a week in Hong Kong and  32  more than 60 signs; 22 of them appear in the series that capture the signs lighting up lonely streets—an  33  that makes it easy to admire their colors and craftsmanship. "I love the beautiful, handcrafted, old-fashioned  34   of neon," says Blance. The signs do nothing more than  	35  a restaurant, theater, or other business, but do so in the most striking way possible.

New Jersey School District Eases Pressure on Students，Baring an Ethnic Divide
A) This fall, David Aderhold, the chief of a high-achieving school district near Princeton, New Jersey, sent parents an alarming 16-page letter. The school district, he said, was facing a crisis. Its students were overburdened and stressed out, having to cope with too much work and too many demands. In the previous school year, 120 middle and high school students were recommended for mental health assessments and 40 were hospitalized. And on a survey administered by the district, students wrote things like, "I hate going to school," and "Coming out of 12 years in this district, I have learned one thing: that a grade, a percentage or even a point is to be valued over anything else."
B) With his letter, Aderhold inserted West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District into a national discussion about the intense focus on achievement at elite schools, and whether it has gone too far. At follow-up meetings, he urged parents to join him in advocating a "whole child" approach to schooling that respects "social-emotional development" and "deep and meaningful learning" over academics alone. The alternative, he suggested, was to face the prospect of becoming another Palo Alto, California, where outsize stress on teenage students is believed to have contributed to a number of suicides in the last six years.
C) But instead of bringing families together, Aderhold's letter revealed a divide in the district, which has 9,700 students, and one that broke down roughly along racial lines. On one side are white parents like Catherine Foley, a former president of the Parent-Teacher-Student Association at her daughter's middle school, who has come to see the district's increasingly pressured atmosphere as opposed to learning. "My son was in fourth grade and told me, 'I'm not going to amount to anything because I have nothing to put on my resume,'" she said. On the other side are parents like Mike Jia, one of the thousands of Asian-American professionals who have moved to the district in the past decade, who said Aderhold's reforms would amount to a "dumbing down" of his children's education. "What is happening here reflects a national anti-intellectual trend that will not prepare our children for the future," Jia said.
D) About 10 minutes from Princeton and an hour and a half from New York City, West Windsor and Plainsboro have become popular bedroom communities for technology entrepreneurs, researchers and engineers, drawn in large part by the public schools. From the last three graduating classes, 16 seniors were admitted to MIT. It produces Science Olympiad winners, classically trained musicians and students with perfect SAT scores.
E) The district has become increasingly popular with immigrant families from China, India and Korea. This year, 65 percent of its students are Asian-American, compared with 44 percent in 2007. Many of them are the first in their families born in the United States. They have had a growing influence on the district. Asian-American parents are enthusiastic supporters of the competitive instrumental music program. They have been huge supporters of the district's advanced mathematics program, which once began in the fourth grade but will now start in the sixth. The change to the program, in which 90 percent of the participating students are Asian-American, is one of Aderhold's reforms.
F) Asian-American students have been eager participants in a state program that permits them to take summer classes off campus for high school credit, allowing them to maximize the number of honors and Advanced Placement classes they can take, another practice that Aderhold is limiting this school year. With many Asian-American children attending supplementary instructional programs, there is a perception among some white families that the elementary school curriculum is being sped up to accommodate them.
G) Both Asian-American and white families say the tension between the two groups has grown steadily over the past few years, as the number of Asian families has risen. But the division has become more obvious in recent months as Aderhold has made changes, including no-homework nights, an end to high school midterms and finals, and an initiative that made it easier to participate in the music program.
H) Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the Asian American Achievement Paradox, says misunderstandings between first-generation Asian-American parents and those who have been in this country longer are common. What white middle-class parents do not always understand, she said, is how much pressure recent immigrants feel to boost their children into the middle class. "They don’t have the same chances to get their children internships (实习职位) or jobs at law firms," Lee said. "So what they believe is that their children must excel and beat their white peers in academic settings so they have the same chances to excel later. "
I) The issue of the stresses felt by students in elite school districts has gained attention in recent years as schools in places like Newton, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto have reported a number of suicides. West Windsor-Plainsboro has not had a teenage suicide in recent years, but Aderhold, who has worked in the district for seven years and been chief for the last three years, said he had seen troubling signs. In a recent art assignment, a middle school student depicted (描绘) an overburdened child who was being scolded for earning an A, rather than an A+ , on a math exam. In the image, the mother scolds the student with the words, "Shame on you!" Further, he said, the New Jersey Education Department has flagged at least two pieces of writing on state English language assessments in which students expressed suicidal thoughts.
J) The survey commissioned by the district found that 68 percent of high school honor and Advanced Placement students reported feeling stressed about school "always or most of the time." "We need to bring back some balance," Aderhold said. "You don't want to wait until it's too late to do something. "
K) Not all public opinion has fallen along racial lines. Karen Sue, the Chinese-American mother of a fifth-grader and an eighth-grader, believes the competition within the district has gotten out of control. Sue, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents, wants her peers to dial it back. "It's become an arms race, an educational arms race," she said. "We all want our kids to achieve and be successful. The question is, at what cost?"
36. Aderhold is limiting the extra classes that students are allowed to take off campus.
37. White and Asian-American parents responded differently to Aderhold's appeal.
38. Suicidal thoughts have appeared in some students' writings.
39. Aderhold's reform of the advanced mathematics program will affect Asian-American students most.
40. Aderhold appealed for parents' support in promoting an all-round development of children, instead of focusing only on their academic performance.
41. One Chinese-American parent thinks the competition in the district has gone too far.
42. Immigrant parents believe that academic excellence will allow their children equal chances to succeed in the 		future.
43. Many businessmen and professionals have moved to West Windsor and Plainsboro because of the public 	schools there.
44. A number of students in Aderhold's school district were found to have stress-induced mental health problems.
45. The tension between Asian-American and white families has increased in recent years.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 and 50 are based on the following passage.
　　For thousands of years, people have known that the best way to understand a concept is to explain it to someone else. "While we teach, we learn," said Roman philosopher Seneca. Now scientists are bringing this ancient wisdom up-to-date. They're documenting why teaching is such a fruitful way to learn, and designing innovative ways for young people to engage in instruction.
　　Researchers have found that students who sign up to tutor others work harder to understand the material, recall it more accurately and apply it more effectively. Student teachers score higher on tests than pupils who're learning only for their own sake. But how can children, still learning themselves, teach others? One answer: They can tutor younger kids. Some studies have found that first-born children are more intelligent than their later-born siblings (兄弟姐妹). This suggests their higher IQs result from the time they spend teaching their siblings. Now educators are experimenting with ways to apply this model to academic subjects. They engage college undergraduates to teach computer science to high school students, who in turn instruct middle school students on the topic.
　　But the most cutting-edge tool under development is the "teachable agent"—a computerized character who learns, tries, makes mistakes and asks questions just like a real-world pupil. Computer scientists have created an animated (动画的) figure called Betty's Brain, who has been "taught" about environmental science by hundreds of middle school students. Student teachers are motivated to help Betty master certain materials. While preparing to teach, they organize their knowledge and improve their own understanding. And as they explain the information to it, they identify problems in their own thinking.
　　Feedback from the teachable agents further enhances the tutors' learning. The agents' questions compel student tutors to think and explain the materials in different ways, and watching the agent solve problems allows them to see their knowledge put into action.
　　Above all, it's the emotions one experiences in teaching that facilitate learning. Student tutors feel upset when their teachable agents fail, but happy when these virtual pupils succeed as they derive pride and satisfaction from someone else's accomplishment.
46. What are researchers rediscovering through their studies?
	A) Seneca's thinking is still applicable today.
	B) Better learners will become better teachers.
	C) Human intelligence tends to grow with age.
	D) Philosophical thinking improves instruction.
47. What do we learn about Betty's Brain?
	A) It is a character in a popular animation.
	B) It is a teaching tool under development.
	C) It is a cutting-edge app in digital games.
	D) It is a tutor for computer science students.
48. How does teaching others benefit student tutors?
	A) It makes them aware of what they are strong at.
	B) It motivates them to try novel ways of teaching.
	C) It helps them learn their academic subjects better.
	D) It enables them to better understand their teachers.
49. What do students do to teach their teachable agents?
	A) They motivate them to think independently.
	B) They ask them to design their own questions.
	C) They encourage them to give prompt feedback.
	D) They use various ways to explain the materials.
50. What is the key factor that eases student tutors' learning?
	A) Their sense of responsibility. 
	B) Their emotional involvement. 
	C) The learning strategy acquired.
	D) The teaching experience gained.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　A new batch of young women—members of the so-called Millennial (千禧的) generation—has been entering the workforce for the past decade. At the starting line of their careers, they are better educated than their mothers and grandmothers had been—or than their young male counterparts are now. But when they look ahead, they see roadblocks to their success. They believe that women are paid less than men for doing the same job. They think it's easier for men to get top executive jobs than it is for them. And they assume that if and when they have children, it will be even harder for them to advance in their careers.
　　While the public sees greater workplace equality between men and women now than it did 20-30 years ago, most believe more change is needed. Among Millennial women, 75% say this country needs to continue making changes to achieve gender equality in the workplace, compared with 57% of Millennial men. Even so, relatively few young women (15%) say they have been discriminated against at work because of their gender.
　　As Millennial women come of age they share many of the same views and values about work as their male counterparts. They want jobs that provide security and flexibility, and they place relatively little importance on high pay. At the same time, however, young working women are less likely than men to aim at top management jobs: 34% say they're not interested in becoming a boss or top manager; only 24% of young men say the same. The gender gap on this question is even wider among working adults in their 30s and 40s, when many women face the trade-offs that go with work and motherhood.
　　These findings are based on a new Pew Research Center survey of 2,002 adults, including 810 Millennials (ages 18-32), conducted Oct. 7-27, 2013. The survey finds that, in spite of the dramatic gains women have made in educational attainment and labor force participation in recent decades, young women view this as a man's world—just as middle-aged and older women do.

51. What do we learn from the first paragraph about Millennial women starting their careers?
	A) They can get ahead only by striving harder.
	B) They expect to succeed just like Millennial men.
	C) They are generally quite optimistic about their future.
	D) They are better educated than their male counterparts.
52. How do most Millennial women feel about their treatment in the workplace?
	A) They are the target of discrimination. 
	B) They find it satisfactory on the whole.
	C) They think it needs further improving.
	D) They find their complaints ignored.
53. What do Millennial women value most when coming of age?
	A) A sense of accomplishment. 
	B) Job stability and flexibility.
	C) Rewards and promotions.
	D) Joy derived from work.
54. What are women in their 30s and 40s concerned about?
	A) The welfare of their children. 
	B) The narrowing of the gender gap. 
	C) The fulfillment of their dreams in life.
	D) The balance between work and family.
55. What conclusion can be drawn about Millennial women from the 2013 survey?
	A) They still view this world as one dominated by males.
	B) They account for half the workforce in the job market.
	C) They see the world differently from older generations.
	D) They do better in work than their male counterparts.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　Millions die early from air pollution each year. Air pollution costs the global economy more than $5 trillion annually in welfare costs, with the most serious 26 occurring in the developing world.
　　The figures include a number of costs 27 with air pollution. Lost income alone amounts to $225 billion a year.
　　The report includes both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Indoor pollution, which includes 28 like home heating and cooking, has remained 29 over the past several decades despite advances in the area. Levels of outdoor pollution have grown rapidly along with rapid growth in industry and transportation.
　　Director of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Chris Murray 30 it as an “urgent call to action.”“One of the risk factors for premature deaths is the air we breathe, over which individuals have little 31 ,”he said.
　　The effects of air pollution are worst in the developing world, where in some places lost-labor income 32 nearly 1% of GDP. Around 9 in 10 people in low-and middle-income countries live in places where they 33 experience dangerous levels of outdoor air pollution.
　　But the problem is not limited 34 to the developing world. Thousands die prematurely in the U.S. as a result of related illnesses. In many European countries, where diesel(柴油) 35 have become more common in recent years, that number reaches tens of thousands.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Food-as-Medicine Movement Is Witnessing Progress
[A] Several times a month, you can find a doctor in the aisles of Ralph’s market in Huntington Beach, California, wearing a white coat and helping people learn about food. On one recent day, this doctor was Daniel Nadeau, wandering the cereal aisle with Allison Scott, giving her some idea on how to feed kids who persistently avoid anything that is healthy. “Have you thought about trying fresh juices in the morning?” he asks her. “The frozen oranges and apples are a little cheaper, and fruits are really good for the brain. Juices are quick and easy to prepare, you can take the frozen fruit out the night before and have it ready the next morning.”
[B] Scott is delighted to get food advice from a physician who is program director of the nearby Mary and Dick Allen Diabetes Center, part of the St. Joseph Hoag Health alliance. The center’s ‘Shop with Your Doc’ program sends doctors to the grocery store to meet with any patients who sign up for the service, plus any other shoppers who happen to be around with questions.
[C] Nadeau notices the pre-made macaroni (通心粉)-and-cheese boxes in Scott’s shopping cart and suggests she switch to whole grain macaroni and real cheese. “So I’d have to make it?”she asks, her enthusiasm fading at the thought of how long that might take, just to have her kids reject it. “I’m not sure they’d eat it. They just won’t eat it.”
[D] Nadeau says sugar and processed foods are big contributors to the rising diabetes rates among children. “In America, over 50 percent of our food is processed food,” Nadeau tells her. “And only 5 percent of our food is plant-based food. I think we should try to reverse that.” Scott agrees to try more fruit juices for the kids and to make real macaroni and cheese. Score one point for the doctor, zero for diabetes.
[E] Nadeau is part of a small revolution developing across California. The food-as-medicine movement has been around for decades, but it’s making progress as physicians and medical institutions make food a formal part of treatment, rather than relying solely on medications (药物). By prescribing nutritional changes or launching programs such as ‘Shop with your Doc’, they are trying to prevent, limit or even reverse disease by changing what patients eat. “There’s no question people can take things a long way toward reversing diabetes, reversing high blood pressure, even preventing cancer by food choices,” Nadeau says.
[F] In the big picture, says Dr. Richard Afable, CEO and president of ST. Joseph Hoag Health, medical institutions across the state are starting to make a philosophical switch to becoming a health organization, not just a health care organization. That feeling echoes the beliefs of the Therapeutic Food Pantry program at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, which completed its pilot phase and is about to expand on an ongoing basis to five clinic sites throughout the city. The program will offer patients several bags of food prescribed for their condition, along with intensive training in how to cook it. “We really want to link food and medicine, and not just give away food,” says Dr. Rita Nguyen, the hospital’s medical director of Healthy Food Initiatives. “We want people to understand what they’re eating, how to prepare it, the role food plays in their lives.”
[G] In Southern California, Loma Linda University School of Medicine is offering specialized training for its resident physicians in Lifestyle Medicine — that is a formal specialty in using food to treat disease. Research findings increasingly show the power of food to treat or reverse diseases, but that does not mean that diet alone is always the solution, or that every illness can benefit substantially from dietary changes. Nonetheless, physicians say that they look at the collective data and a clear picture emerges: that the salt, sugar, fat and processed foods in the American diet contribute to the nation’s high rates of obesity, diabetes and heart disease. According to the World Health Organization, 80 percent of deaths from heart disease and stroke are caused by high blood pressure, tobacco use, elevated cholesterol and low consumption of fruits and vegetables.
[H] “It’s a different paradigm(范式) of how to treat disease,” says Dr. Brenda Rea, who helps run the family and preventive medicine residency program at Loma Linda University School of Medicine. The lifestyle medicine specialty is designed to train doctors in how to prevent and treat disease, in part, by changing patients’ nutritional habits. The medical center and school at Loma Linda also has a food cupboard and kitchen for patients. This way, patients not only learn about which foods to buy, but also how to prepare them at home.
[I] Many people don’t know how to cook, Rea says, and they only know how to heat things up. That means depending on packaged food with high salt and sugar content. So teaching people about which foods are healthy and how to prepare them, she says, can actually transform a patient’s life. And beyond that, it might transform the health and lives of that patient’s family. “What people eat can be medicine or poison,” Rea says. “As a physician, nutrition is one of the most powerful things you can change to reverse the effects of long-term disease.”
[J] Studies have explored evidence that dietary changes can slow inflammation(炎症), for example, or make the body inhospitable to cancer cells. In general, many lifestyle medicine physicians recommend a plant-based diet — particularly for people with diabetes or other inflammatory conditions.
[K] “As what happened with tobacco, this will require a cultural shift, but that can happen,” says Nguyen. “In the same way physicians used to smoke, and then stopped smoking and were able to talk to patients about it, I think physicians can have a bigger voice in it.”
36. More than half of the food Americans eat is factory-produced.
37. There is a special program that assigns doctors to give advice to shoppers in food stores.
38. There is growing evidence from research that food helps patients recover from various illnesses.
39. A healthy breakfast can be prepared quickly and easily.
40. Training a patient to prepare healthy food can change their life.
41. One food-as-medicine program not only prescribes food for treatment but teaches patients how to cook it.
42. Scott is not keen on cooking food herself, thinking it would simply be a waste of time.
43. Diabetes patients are advised to eat more plant-based food.
44. Using food as medicine is no novel idea, but the movement is making headway these days.
45. Americans’ high rates of various illnesses result from the way they eat.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 and 50 are based on the following passage.
　　California has been facing a drought for many years now, with certain areas even having to pump freshwater hundreds of miles to their distribution system. The problem is growing as the population of the state continues to expand. New research has found deep water reserves under the state which could help solve their drought crisis. Previous drilling of wells could only reach depths of 1,000 feet, but due to new pumping practices, water deeper than this can now be extracted (抽取). The team at Stanford investigated the aquifers(地下蓄水层)below this depth and found that reserves may be triple what was previously thought.
　　It is profitable to drill to depths more than 1,000 feet for oil and gas extraction, but only recently in California has it become profitable to pump water from this depth. The aquifers range from 1,000 to 3,000 feet below the ground, which means that pumping will be expensive and there are other concerns. The biggest concern of pumping out water from this deep is the gradual settling down of the land surface. As the water is pumped out, the vacant space left is compacted by the weight of the earth above.
　　Even though pumping from these depths is expensive, it is still cheaper than desalinating(脱盐)the ocean water in the largely coastal state. Some desalination plants exist where feasible, but they are costly to run and can need constant repairs. Wells are much more reliable sources of freshwater, and California is hoping that these deep wells may be the answer to their severe water shortage.
　　One problem with these sources is that the deep water also has a higher level of salt than shallower aquifers. This means that some wells may even need to undergo desalination after extraction, thus increasing the cost. Research from the exhaustive study of groundwater from over 950 drilling logs has just been published. New estimates of the water reserves now go up to 2,700 billion cubic meters of freshwater.

46.How could California’s drought crisis be solved according to some researchers?
A) By building more reserves of groundwater.
B) By drawing water from the depths of the earth.
C) By developing more advanced drilling devices.
D) By upgrading its water distribution system.
47.What can be inferred about extracting water from deep aquifers?
A) It was deemed vital to solving the water problem.
B) It was not considered worth the expense.
C) It may not provide quality freshwater.
D) It is bound to gain support from the local people.
48. What is mentioned as a consequence of extracting water from deep underground?
A) The sinking of land surface. C) The damage to aquifers.
B) The harm to the ecosystem. D) The change of the climate.
49. What does the author say about deep wells?
A) They run without any need for repairs.
B) They are entirely free from pollutants.
C) They are the ultimate solution to droughts.
D) They provide a steady supply of freshwater.
50. What may happen when deep aquifers are used as water sources?
A) People’s health may improve with cleaner water.
B) People’s water bills may be lowered considerably.
C) The cost may go up due to desalination.
D) They may be exhausted sooner or later.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　The AlphaGo program’s victory is an example of how smart computers have become.
　　But can artificial intelligence (AI) machines act ethically, meaning can they be honest and fair?
　　One example of AI is driverless cars. They are already on California roads, so it is not too soon to ask whether we can program a machine to act ethically. As driverless cars improve, they will save lives. They will make fewer mistakes than human drivers do. Sometimes, however, they will face a choice between lives. Should the cars be programmed to avoid hitting a child running across the road, even if that will put their passengers at risk? What about making a sudden turn to avoid a dog? What if the only risk is damage to the car itself, not to the passengers?
　　Perhaps there will be lessons to learn from driverless cars, but they are not super-intelligent beings. Teaching ethics to a machine even more intelligent than we are will be the bigger challenge.
　　About the same time as AlphaGo’s triumph, Microsoft’s ‘chatbot’ took a bad turn. The software, named Taylor, was designed to answer messages from people aged 18-24. Taylor was supposed to be able to learn from the messages she received. She was designed to slowly improve her ability to handle conversations, but some people were teaching Taylor racist ideas. When she started saying nice things about Hitler, Microsoft turned her off and deleted her ugliest messages.
　　AlphaGo’s victory and Taylor’s defeat happened at about the same time. This should be a warning to us. It is one thing to use AI within a game with clear rules and clear goals. It is something very different to use AI in the real world. The unpredictability of the real world may bring to the surface a troubling software problem.
　　Eric Schmidt is one of the bosses of Google, which owns AlphoGo. He thinks AI will be positive for humans. He said people will be the winner, whatever the outcome. Advances in AI will make human beings smarter, more able and “just better human beings.”
51.What does the author want to show with the example of AlphaGo’s victory?
A)Computers will prevail over human beings.
B)Computers have unmatched potential.
C)Computers are man’s potential rivals.
D)Computers can become highly intelligent.
52.What does the author mean by AI machines acting ethically?
A)They are capable of predicting possible risks.
B)They weigh the gains and losses before reaching a decision.
C)They make sensible decisions when facing moral dilemmas.
D)They sacrifice everything to save human lives.
53.What is said to be the bigger challenge facing humans in the AI age?
A)How to make super-intelligent AI machines share human feelings.
B)How to ensure that super-intelligent AI machines act ethically.
C)How to prevent AI machines doing harm to humans.
D)How to avoid being over-dependent on AI machines.
54.What do we learn about Microsoft’s “chatbot” Taylor?
A)She could not distinguish good from bad.
B)She could turn herself off when necessary.
C)She was not made to handle novel situations.
D)She was good at performing routine tasks.
55. What does Eric Schmidt think of artificial intelligence?
A) It will be far superior to human beings.
B) It will keep improving as time goes by.
C) It will prove to be an asset to human beings.
D) It will be here to stay whatever the outcome.

Part Ⅲ                      Reading Comprehension                  ( 40 minutes )
Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　Have you ever used email to apologize to a colleague? Delivered a    26    to a subordinate (下属) with a voice-mail message? Flown by plane across the country just to deliver important news in person? The various communication options at our fingertips today can be good for    27    and productivity—and at the same time very troublesome. With so many ways to communicate, how should a manager choose the one that's best—   28    when the message to be delivered is bad or unwelcome news for the recipient? We've    29    business communication consultants and etiquette (礼仪) experts to come up with the following guidelines for  30    using the alternative ways of delivering difficult messages.
　　First of all, choose how personal you want to be. A face-to-face communication is the most    31   . Other choices, in descending order of personalization, are: a real-time phone call, a voice-mail message, a handwritten note, a typewritten letter, and the most    32    is email. Some of these may change order according to the    33    situation or your own preferences; for example, a handwritten note might seem more personal than voice-mail. How do you decide on the best choice for the difficult message you've got to deliver? “My    34    concern is: How can I soften or civilize this message?” says etiquette expert Dana Casperson. “So when I apologize, I usually choose in-person first, or a phone conversation as my top alternative, and maybe a handwritten note next. Apologizing by email is something I now totally  35   .”
A) avoid                    I) reward
B) convenience               J) silent 
C) effectively                
D) escape                   K) specific       
E) intimate                  L) surveyed          
F) particularly               M) unfriendly
G) primary                  N) warning
H) prompt                  O) witnessed

　　　           How a Poor, Abandoned Parisian Boy Became a Top Chef
A) The busy streets in Paris were uneven and caked in thick mud, but there was always a breathtaking sight to see in the shop windows of Patisserie de la Rue de la Paix. By 1814, people crowded outside the bakery, straining for a glimpse of the latest sweet food created by the young chef who worked inside.
B)	His name was Marie-Antoine Carême, and he had appeared, one day, almost out of nowhere. But in his short lifetime, which ended exactly 184 years ago today, he would forever revolutionize French gourmet food （美食), write best-selling cook books and think up magical dishes for royals and other important people.
C)	Carême's childhood was one part tragedy, equal part mystery. Born the 16th child to poor parents in Paris in either 1783 or 1784, a young Carême was suddenly abandoned at the height of the French Revolution. At 8 years old, he worked as a kitchen boy for a restaurant in Paris in exchange for room and board. By age 15, he had become an apprentice （学徒） to Sylvain Bailly, a well-known dessert chef with a successful bakery in one of Paris's most fashionable neighborhoods.
D)	Carême was quick at learning in the kitchen. Bailly encouraged his young apprentice to learn to read and write. Carême would often spend his free afternoons at the nearby National Library reading books on art and architecture. In the back room of the little bakery, his interest in design and his baking talent combined to work wonders—he shaped delicious masterpieces out of flour, butter and sugar.
E)	In his teenage years, Carême fashioned eatable copies of the late 18th century's most famous buildings—cookies in the shape of ruins of ancient Athens and pies in the shape of ancient Chinese palaces and temples. Sylvain Bailly, his master, displayed these luxuriant creations—often as large as 4 feet tall—in his bakery windows.
F)	Carême's creations soon captured the discriminating eye of a French diplomat, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord. Around 1804, Talleyrand challenged Carême to produce a full menu for his personal castle, instructing the young baker to use local, seasonal fruits and vegetables and to avoid repeating main dishes over the course of an entire year. The experiment was a grand success and Talleyrand's association with French nobility would prove a profitable connection for Carême.
G) French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was known to be unimpressed by the declining taste of early 18th century cooking, but under pressure to entertain Paris's high society, he too called Carême to his kitchen at Tuileries Palace. In 1810, Carême designed the extraordinary cake for the wedding of Napoleon and his second bride, Marie-Louise of Austria. He became one of the first modern chefs to focus on the appearance of his table, not just the flavor of his dishes. “I want order and taste. A well-displayed meal is enhanced one hundred percent in my eyes,” he later wrote in one of his cook books.
H)	In 1816, Carême began a culinary (烹饪的) journey which would forever mark his place as history's first top chef. He voyaged to England to cook in the modern Great Kitchen of the prince regent (摄政王)， George Ⅳ, and crossed continents to prepare grand banquets for the tables of Tsar Alexander Ⅰ of Russia. Never afraid to talk up his own accomplishments, a boastful Carême made a fortune as wealthy families with social ambitions invited him to their kitchens. Later, in his cook books, he would often include a sketch of himself, so that people on the street would be able to recognize—and admire—him.
I)	Carême's cooking displays became the symbol of fine French dining; they were plentiful, beautiful and imposing. Guests would fall silent in wonder as servants carried Carême's fancy creations into the dining hall. For a banquet celebrating the Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia's visit to George Ⅳ's Brighton Pavillion on Jan. 18, 1817, the menu featured 120 different dishes, highlighting eight different soups, 40 main courses, and 32 desserts.
J)As he traveled through the homes of early 19th century nobility, Carême forged the new art of French gourmet food. Locked in hot kitchens, Carême created his four “mother sauces.” These sauces—béchamel, velouté, espagnole and allemande—formed the central building blocks for many French main courses. He also perfected the soufflé—a baked egg dish, and introduced the standard chef's uniform—the same double-breasted white coat and tall white hat still worn by many chefs today. The white clothing conveyed an image of cleanliness, according to Carême—and in his realm, appearance was everything.
K)Between meals, Carême wrote cook books that would be used in European kitchens for the next century. His manuals including The Royal Parisian Baker and the massive five-volume Art of French Cooking Series (1833-1847, completed after his death) first systematized many basic principles of cooking, complete with drawings and step-by-step directions. Long before television cooking shows, Carême walked readers through common kitchen tasks, instructing them to “try this for yourself, at home” as famous American Chef Julia Child might do, many years later.
L）In the end, however， it was the kitchen that did Carême in. Decades of working over coal fires in tight, closed spaces with little fresh air (to ensure his dishes would not get cold) had fatally damaged his lungs. On Jan. 12, 1833, Carême died just before he turned 50.
M）But in his lifetime, Carême, ever confident, could see beyond his short domination in the kitchen. He wanted to “set the standard for beauty in classical and modern cooking, and prove to the distant future that the French chefs of the 19th century were the most famous in the world,” as he wrote in his papers.
N）Decades later, chef Auguste Escoffier would build upon Carême's concept of French cuisine （烹饪）. But in the very beginning, there was just Carême, the top chef who elevated dining into art.
36. Carême was among the first chefs who stressed both the appearance and flavor of dishes.
37. Carême wanted to show to later generations that French chefs of his time were most outstanding in the world.
38. Carême benefited greatly from serving a French diplomat and his connections.

45. Carême's contribution to French cooking was revolutionary.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　Roughly the size of a soda can, sitting on a bookshelf, a relatively harmless gadget may be turning friends away from your home. The elephant in your living room is your Internet-connected security camera, a device people are increasingly using for peace of mind in their homes. But few stop to think about the effect these devices may have on house guests. Should you tell your friends, for instance, that they're being recorded while you all watch the big game together?
　　“It's certainly new territory, especially as home security cameras become easier to install,” says Lizzie Post, president of the Emily Post Institute, America's foremost manners advisors. “I think it will be very interesting to see what etiquette （礼仪） emerges in terms of whether you tell people you have a camera or not, and whether guests have a right to ask that it be turned off, if it's not a security issue.”
　　Post wants to make clear that she's not talking about legal rights, but rather personal preferences. She also wants to explain that there are no right or wrong answers regarding manners on this front yet, because the technology is just now becoming mainstream. Besides, the Emily Post Institute doesn't dictate manners.
　　When it comes to security cameras, Post says it's a host's responsibility to make sure guests feel comfortable within their home. “I'm always a fan of being open and honest.” For instance, if the host casually acknowledges that there is a camera in the room by telling a story about it, that may be enough to provide an opening for a guest to say if they are uncomfortable.
　　However, if a contractor is working in your home, you don't need to tell them that there are cameras watching. Then again, the air of accountability that the camera generates can also work in contractors' favor. “If anything does go wrong while they're in the house, they don't want to be blamed for it,” she says. “In fact, the camera could be the thing that proves that they didn't steal the $20, or knock the vase off the table.”
　　46.For what reason may your friends feel reluctant to visit your home?
　　A) The security camera installed may intrude into their privacy.
　　B) They don’t want their photos to be circulated on the Internet.
　　C) The security camera may turn out to be harmful to their health.
　　D) They may not be willing to interact with your family members.
　　47.What does Lizzie Post say is new territory?
　　A) The effect of manners advice on the public.
　　B) Cost of applying new technologies at home.
　　C) The increasing use of home security devices.
　　D) Etiquette around home security cameras.
　　48. What is Lizzie Post mainly discussing with regard to the use of home security cameras?
　　A) Legal rights.				C) Likes and dislikes of individuals.
　　B)Moral issues				D) The possible impact on manners.
　　49. What is a host’s responsibility regarding security cameras, according to Lizzie Post?
　　A) Making their guests feel at ease.
　　B) Indicating where they are.
　　C) Turning them off in time.
　　D) Ensuring their guests’ privacy.
　　50. In what way can the home security camera benefit visitors to your home?
　　A) It can satisfy their curiosity.
　　B) It can prove their innocence.
　　C) It can help them learn new technology.
　　D) It can make their visit more enjoyable.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　PepsiCo is to spend billions of dollars to develop drinks and snacks and reformulate existing ones with lower sugar, salt and fat, as consumers demand healthier options and regulatory pressure intensifies amid an obesity epidemic（流行病）.
　　The maker of Mountain Dew and Gatorade has been one of the earlier movers in the industry to offer products with reduced levels of unhealthy ingredients—PepsiCo claims a packet of its chips now contains less salt than a slice of white bread. However, its new 10-year plan makes clear it believes it still has a long way to go.
　　Shifting eating habits, including a sharp drop in consumption of sparkling drinks, have forced radical change on the industry. But those shifts have yet to be reflected in record obesity levels, which stand at 36.5% overall in the US.
　　Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo chairman, said the plan to make its products healthier was important for the company's growth. But on the subject of obesity, she pointed out that consumers’ lifestyles have changed significantly, with many people being more sedentary （久坐不动的） not least because more time is spent in front of computers. She said PepsiCo's contribution was to produce healthier snacks that still tasted good.
　　“Society has to change its habits,” she added. “We can't do much to alter sedentary lifestyles, but we can provide consumers with great-tasting products, low in salt, sugar and fat. In the past we had to have a taste trade-off. But we're breaking that trade-off.”
　　PepsiCo's plan for its foods and drinks is based on guidelines from the World Health Organisation, which last week backed using taxes on sparkling drinks to reduce sugar consumption. Initiatives also include efforts to reduce its environmental impact, water consumption and materials used in packaging by 2025.
　　PepsiCo did not say exactly how much it planned to invest to reach its goals. However, Dr Mehmood Khan, chief scientific officer, said the company had doubled research and development spending in the past five years and was “committed to sustaining investment”, adding that companies cannot cost-cut their way to increasing sales.  PepsiCo's research and development budget in 2015 was $754 million.
　　51.Why is PepsiCo making a policy change?
　　A) To win support from the federal government.
　　B) To be more competitive in the global market.
　　C) To satisfy the growing needs for healthy foods.
　　D) To invest more wisely in the soft drink industry.
　　52. What does PepsiCo think it will have to do in the future?
　　A) Invest more to develop new snacks.
　　B) Reduce levels of obesity in the US.
　　C) Change consumers’ eating habits.
　　D) Keep on improving its products.
　　53. Why does PepsiCo plan to alter its products, according to Indra Nooyi?
　　A) To ensure the company’s future development.
　　B) To adapt to its customers’ changed taste.
　　C) To help improve its consumers’ lifestyles.
　　D) To break the trade-off in its product design.
　　54. What does Indra Nooyi say about the obesity epidemic?
　　A) It is mainly caused by overconsumption of snacks.
　　B) It results from high sugar and salt consumption.
　　C) It is attributable to people’s changed lifestyles.
　　D) It has a lot to do with longer working hours.
　　55. What has PepsiCo been doing to achieve its objective?
　　A) Studying WHO’s guidelines.			B) Increasing its research funding.
　　C) Expanding its market overseas.			D) Cutting its production costs.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　A few months ago, I was down with a terrible cold which ended in a persistent bad cough. No matter how many different  26  I tried, I still couldn’t get rid of the cough. Not only did it  27  my teaching but also my life as a whole. Then one day after class, a student came up to me and  28  traditional Chinese medicine. From her description, Chinese medicine sounded as if it had magic power that worked wonders. I was 	29  because I knew so little about it and have never tried it before. Eventually, my cough got so much  30  that I couldn’t sleep at night, so I decided to give it a try. The Chinese doctor took my pulse and asked to see my tongue, both of which were new  31  to me because they are both non-existent in Western medicine. Then the doctor gave me a scraping（刮）treatment known as “Gua Sha”.  I was a little  32  at first because he used a smooth edged tool to scrape the skin on my neck and shoulders. A few minutes later, the  33  strokes started to produce a relieving effect and my body and mind began to  34  deeper into relaxation. I didn’t feel any improvement in my condition in the first couple of days, but after a few more regular visits to the doctor, my cough started to  35  . Then, within a matter of weeks, it was completely gone!
A) deepen                    I)remedies
B) experiences                J) scared

ls it really OK to eat food that’s fallen on the floor?
　　
A) When you drop a piece of food on the floor, is it really OK to eat if you pick it up within five seconds? An urban food myth contends that if food spends just a few seconds on the floor, dirt and germs won’t have much of a chance to contaminate it. Research in my lab has focused on how food becomes contaminated, and we’ve done some work on this particular piece of wisdom.
B) While the “five-second rule” might not seem like the most pressing issue for food scientists to get to the bottom of, it’s still worth investigating food myths like this one because they shape our beliefs about when food is safe to eat.
C) So is five seconds on the floor the critical threshold（门槛）that separates a piece of eatable food from a case of food poisoning? It’s a bit more complicated than that. It depends on just how many bacteria can make it from floor to food in a few seconds and just how dirty the floor is.
D) Wondering if food is still OK to eat after it’s dropped on the floor is a pretty common experience. And it’s probably not a new one either. A well-known, but inaccurate, story about Julia Child may have contributed to this food myth. Some viewers of her cooking show, The French Chef, insist they saw Child drop lamb on the floor and pick it up, with the advice that if they were alone in the kitchen, their guests would never know.
E) In fact it was a potato pancake, and it fell on the stovetop, not on the floor. Child put it back in the pan, saying, “But you can always pick it up and if you’re alone in the kitchen, who’s going to see it?” But the misremembered story persists. It’s harder to pin down the origins of the oft-quoted five-second rule, but a 2003 study reported that 70% of women and 56% of men surveyed were familiar with the five-second rule and that women were more likely than men to eat food that had dropped on the floor.
F) So what does science tell us about what a few moments on the floor means for the safety of your food? The earliest research report on the five-second rule is attributed to Jillian Clarke, a high school student participating in a research project at the University of Illinois. Clarke and her colleagues introduced bacteria to floor tiles（瓷砖）and then placed cookies on the tiles for varying times. They reported bacteria were transferred from the tiles to the cookies within five seconds, but didn’t report the specific amount of bacteria that made it from the tiles to the food.
G) But how many bacteria actually transfer in five seconds? In 2007, my lab at Clemson University published a study in the Journal of Applied Microbiology. We wanted to know if the length of time food is in contact with a contaminated surface affected the rate of transfer of bacteria to the food. To find out, we introduced bacteria to squares of tile, carpet or wood. Five minutes after that, we placed either bacon or bread on the surface for 5,30 or 60 seconds, and then measured the number of bacteria transferred to the food. We repeated this exact procedure after the bacteria had been on the surface for 2,4,8 and 24 hours.
H) We found that the number of bacteria transferred to either kind of food didn’t depend much on how long the food was in contact with the contaminated surface—whether for a few seconds or for a whole minute. The overall number of bacteria on the surface mattered more, and this decreased over time after the initial introduction. It looks like what’s at issue is less how long your food stays on the floor and much more how contaminated with bacteria that patch of floor happens to be.
I) We also found that the kind of surface made a difference as well. Carpets, for instance, seem to be slightly better places to drop your food than wood or tile. When a carpet was contaminated, less than 1% of the bacteria were transferred. But when the food was in contact with tile or wood, 48-70% of bacteria were.
J) Last year, a study from Aston University in the UK used nearly identical parameters（参数）to our study and found similar results. They also reported that 87% of people asked either would eat or had eaten food fallen on the floor.
K) Should you eat food fallen on the floor then? From a food safety standpoint, if you have millions or more bacteria on a surface, 0.1% is still enough to make you sick. Also, certain types of bacteria are extremely harmful, and it takes only a small number to make you sick. For example, 10 bacteria or less of an especially deadly strain of bacteria can cause severe illness and death in people with compromised immune systems. But the chance of these bacteria being on most surfaces is very low.
L）And it’s not just dropping food on the floor that can lead to bacterial contamination. Bacteria are carried by various “media”, which can include raw food, moist surfaces where bacteria have been left, our hands or skin and from coughing or sneezing（打喷嚏）. Hands, foods and utensils（器皿）can carry individual bacteria living in communities contained within a protective film. These microscopic layers of deposits containing bacteria are known as biofilms and they are found on most surfaces and objects. Biofilm communities can harbor bacteria longer and are very difficult to clean. Becteria in these communities also have an enhanced resistance to sanitizers（清洁剂）and antibiotics compared to bacteria living on their own.
M）So the next time you consider eating fallen food, the odds are in your favor that you can eat it without getting sick. But in the rare chance that there is a micro-organism that can make you sick on the exact spot where the food dropped, you can be fairly sure that the bug is on the food you are about to put in your mouth.
N）Research or common sense tells us that the best thing to do is keep your hands, utensils and other surfaces clean.
36. A research project found bacteria made their way to the food on the floor in five seconds.
37. Whether food is contaminated depends much on the number of bacteria that get onto it.
38. Food contamination may result from various factors other than food dropping on the floor.
39. Males are less likely than females to eat food that may have been contaminated.
40. The author’s research centers around how food gets contaminated.
41. Keeping everything clean is the best way to stay healthy.
42. Chances are you will not fall sick because of eating food picked up from the floor.
43. For a long time people have had the experience of deciding whether or not to eat food picked up from the floor.
44. Some strains of bacteria are so harmful that a tiny few can have deadly consequences.
45. Researchers found how many bacteria got onto the food did not have much to do with how long the food stayed on a contaminated floor.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　The latest in cat research reveals that the lovely animal seems to have a basic grasp on both the laws of physics and the ins and outs of cause and effect.
　　According to a newly published study, cats seem to be able to predict the location of hiding prey（猎物）using both their ears and an inborn（天生的）understanding of how the physical world works.
　　In a recent experiment, Japanese researchers taped 30 domestic cats reacting to a container that a team member shook. Some containers rattled（发出响声）；others did not. When the container was tipped over, sometimes an object fell out and sometimes it didn’t.
　　It turns out that the cats were remarkably smart about what would happen when a container was tipped over. When an object did not drop out of the bottom of a rattling container, they looked at it for a longer time than they did when the container behaved as expected.
　　“Cats use a causal-logical understanding of noise or sounds to predict the appearance of invisible objects,” lead researcher Saho Takagi says in a press release. The researchers conclude that cats’ hunting style may have developed based on their common-sense abilities to infer where prey is, using their hearing.
　　Scientists have explored this idea with other endearing creatures: babies. Like cats, babies appear to engage in what’s called “preferential looking”—looking longer at things that are interesting or unusual than things they perceive as normal.
　　When babies’ expectations are violated in experiments like the ones performed with the cats, they react much like their animal friends. Psychologists have shown that babies apparently expect their world to comply with the laws of physics and cause and effect as early as two months of age.
　　Does the study mean that cats will soon grasp the ins and outs of cause and effect? Maybe. Okay, so cats may not be the next physics faculty members at America’s most important research universities. But by demonstrating their common sense, they’ve shown that the divide between cats and humans may not be that great after all.
　　46.What do we learn from a newly published study about cats?
　　A) They can be trained to understand the physical world.
　　B) They know what kind of prey might be easier to hunt.
　　C) They have a natural ability to locate animals they hunt.
　　D) They are capable of telling which way their prey flees.
　　47. What may account for the cats’ response to the noise from the containers?
　　A) Their inborn sensitivity to noise.
　　B) Their unusual sense of direction.
　　C) Their special ability to perceive.
　　D) Their mastery of cause and effect.
　　48. What is characteristic of the way cats hunt, according to the Japanese researchers?
　　A) They depend on their instincts.					C) They wait some time before attack.
　　B)They rely mainly on their hearing.				D) They use both their ears and eyes.
　　49. In what way do babies behave like cats?
　　A) They focus on what appears odd.
　　B) They view the world as normal.
　　C) They do what they prefer to do.
　　D) They are curious about everything.
　　50. What can we conclude about cats from the passage?
　　A) They have higher intelligence than many other animals.
　　B) They interact withe the physical world much like humans.
　　C) They display extraordinarily high intelligence in hunting.
　　D) They can aid physics professors in their research work.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　Imagine you enter a car with no steering wheel, no brake or accelerator padals（踏板）. Under a voice-activated command, you say an address. “The fastest route will take us 15.3 minutes. Should I take it?” You say “yes” and you are on your way. The car responds and starts moving all by itself. All you have to do is sit back and relax.
　　How weird would it be if, one day in the future, everyone had such a car? No crazy driving, no insults, no cutting in; traffic laws would be respected and driving much safer. On the other hand, imagine the cost savings for local police enforcement and town budgets without all those speeding and parking tickets.
　　A new technology has the potential to change modern society in radical ways. There’s no question that self-driving vehicles could be an enormous benefit. The potential for safer cars means accident statistics would drop: some 94% of road accidents in the U.S. involve human error. Older drivers and visually-or physically-impaired people would gain a new level of freedom. Maintaining safe speeds and being electric, self-driving cars would drastically reduce pollution levels and dependency on non-renewable fuels. Roads would be quieter, people safer.
　　But we must also consider the impact of the new technology on those who now depend on driving for their livelihoods. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, in May 2015 there were 505,560 registered school bus drivers. The American Trucking Association lists approximately 3.5 million professional truck drivers in the U.S.
　　The companies developing self-driving vehicles should be partnering with state and federal authorities to offer retraining for this massive workforce, many of whom will be displaced by the new technology. This is similar to what’s happening in the coal and oil industries, a situation that fuels much of the current political discontent in this country.
　　New technologies will, and should, be developed. This is how society moves forward. However, progress can’t be one-sided. It is necessary for the companies and state agencies involved to consider the ethical consequences of these potential changes to build a better future for all.
　　51.What would be the impact of the extensive use of driverless cars?
　　A) People would be driving in a more civilized way.
　　B) It would save local governments a lot of money.
　　C) More policemen would be patrolling the streets.
　　D) Traffic regulations would be a thing of the past.
　　52. How would the elderly and the disabled benefit from driverless cars?
　　A) They could enjoy greater mobility.
　　B) They would suffer no road accidents.
　　C) They would have no trouble driving.
　　D) They could go anywhere they want.
　　53. What would be the negative impact of driverless cars?
　　A) The conflict between labor and management would intensify.
　　B) The gap between various sectors of society would be widened.
　　C) Professional drivers would have a hard time adapting to new road conditions.
　　D) Numerous professional drivers would have to find new ways of earning a living.
　　54. What is the result of the introduction of new technologies in energy industries?
　　A) Political dissatisfaction.
　　B) Retraining of employees.
　　C) Fossil fuel conservation.
　　D) Business restructuring.
　　55. What does the author suggest businesses and the government do?
　　A) Keep pace with technological developments.			
　　B) Make new technologies affordable to everyone.
　　C) Enable everyone to benefit from new technologies.		
　　D) Popularize the use of new technologies and devices.

　　The center of American automobile innovation has in the past decade moved 2,000 miles away. It has  26  from Detroit to Silicon Valley, where self-driving vehicles are coming into life.
    In a  27  to take production back to Detroit, Michigan lawmakers have introduced  28  that could make their state the best place in the country, if not the world, to develop self-driving vehicles and put them on the road.
   “Michigan’s  29  in auto research and development is under attack from several states and countries which desire to  30  our leadership in transportation. We can’t let that happen,” says Senator Mike Kowall, the lead  31  of four bills recently introduced.
    If all four bills pass as written, they would  32  a substantial update of Michigan’s 2013 law that allowed the testing of self-driving vehicles in limited conditions. Manufacturer would have nearly total freedom to test their self-driving technology on public roads. They would be allowed to send groups of self-driving cars on cross-state road trips, and even set up on-demand  33  of self-driving cars, like the one General Motors and Lyft are building.
    Lawmakers in Michigan clearly want to make the state ready for the commercial application of self-driving technology.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

How Work Will Change When Most of Us Live to 100
A. Today in the United States there are 72,000 centenarians（百岁老人）.Worldwide, Probably 450,000. If current trends continue, then by 2050 there will be more than a million in the US alone. According to the work of Professor James Vaupel and his co-researchers, 50% of babies born in the US in 2007 have a life expectancy of 104 or more. Broadly the same holds for the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Canada, and for Japan 50% of 2007 babies can expect to live to 107.
B. Understandably, there are concerns about what this means for public finances given the associated health and pension challenges. These challenges are real, and society urgently needs to address them. But it is also important to look at the wider picture of what happens when so many people live for 100 years. It is a mistake to simply equate longevity (长寿) with issues of old age. Longer lives have implications for all of life, not just the end of it.
C. Our view is that if many people are living for longer, and are healthier for longer, then this will result in an inevitable redesign of work and life. When people live longer, they are not only older for longer, but also younger for longer. There is some truth in the saying that “70 is the new 60” or “40 the new 30.” If you age more slowly over a longer time period, then you are in some sense younger for longer.
D. But the changes go further than that. Take, for instance, the age at which people make commitments such as buying a house, getting married, having children, or starting a career. These are all fundamental commitments that are now occurring later in life. In 1962, 50% of Americans were married by age 21. By 2014, that milestone(里程碑)had shifted to age 29.
E. While there are numerous factors behind these shifts, one factor is surely a growing realization for the young that they are going to live longer. Options are more valuable the longer they can be held. So if you believe you will live longer, then options become more valuable, and early commitment becomes less attractive. The result is that the commitments that previously characterized the beginning of adulthood are now being delayed, and new patterns of behavior and a new stage of life are emerging for those in their twenties.
F. Longevity also pushes back the age of retirement, and not only for financial reasons. Yes, unless people are prepared to save a lot more, our calculations suggest that if you are now in your mid-40s, then you are likely to work until your early 70s; and if you are in your early 20s, there is a real chance you will need to work until your late 70s or possibly even into your 80s. But even if people are able to economically support a retirement at 65, over thirty years of potential inactivity is harmful to cognitive(认知的) and emotional vitality. Many people may simply not want to do it.
G. And yet that does not mean that simply extending our careers is appealing. Just lengthening that second stage of full-time work may secure the financial assets needed for a 100-year life, but such persistent work will inevitably exhaust precious intangible assets such as productive skills, vitality, happiness, and friendship.
H. The same is true for education. It is impossible that a single shot of education, administered in childhood and early adulthood, will be able to support a sustained, 60-year career. If you factor in the projected rates of technological change, either your skills will become unnecessary, or your industry outdated. That means that everyone will, at some point in their life, have to make a number of major reinvestments in their skills.
I. It seems likely, then, that the traditional three-stage life will evolve into multiple stages containing two, three, or even more different careers. Each of these stages could potentially be different. In one the focus could be on building financial success and personal achievement, in another on creating a better work/life balance, still another on exploring and understanding options more fully, or becoming an independent producer, yet another on making a social contribution. These stages will span sectors, take people to different cities, and provide foundation for building a wide variety of skills.
J. Transitions between stages could be marked with sabbaticals (休假) as people find time rest and recharge their health, re-invest in their relationships, or improve their skills. At times, these breaks and transitions will be self-determined, at others they will be forced as existing roles, firms, or industries cease to exist.
K. A multi-stage life will have profound changes not just in how you manage your career, but also in your approach to life. An increasingly important skill will be your ability to deal with change and even welcome it. A three-stage life has few transitions, while a multi-stage life has many. That is why being self-aware, investing in broader networks of friends, and being open to new ideas will become even more crucial skills.
L. These multi-stage lives will create extraordinary variety across groups of people simply because there are so many ways of sequencing the stages. More stages mean more possible sequences.
M. With this variety will come the end of the close association of age and stage. I n a three-stage life, people leave university at the same time and the same age, they tend to start their careers and family at the same age, they proceed through middle management all roughly the same time, and then move into retirement within a few years of each other. In a multi-stage life, you could be an undergraduate at 20, 40, or 60; a manager at 30, 50, or 70; and become an independent producer at any age.
N. Current life structures, career paths, educational choices, and social norms are out of tune with the emerging reality of longer lifespans. The three-stage life of full-time education, followed by continuous work, and then complete retirement may have worked for our parents or even grandparents, but it is not relevant today. We believe that to focus on longevity as primarily an issue of aging is to miss its full implications. Longevity is not necessarily about being older for longer. It is about living longer, being older later, and being younger longer.

36. An extended lifespan in the future will allow people to have more careers than now.
37. Just extending one’s career may have both positive and negative effects.
38. Nowadays, many Americans have on average delayed their marriage by some eight years.
39. Because of their longer lifespan, young people today no longer follow the pattern of life of their parents or grandparents.
40. More people will be expected to live over 100 by the mid-21st century.
41. A longer life will cause radical changes in people’s approach to life.
42. Fast technological change makes it necessary for one to constantly upgrade their skills.
43. Many people may not want to retire early because it would do harm to their mental and emotional well-being.
44. The close link between age and stage may cease to exist in a multi-stage life.
45. People living a longer and healthier life will have to rearrange their work and life.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　In the classic marriage vow（誓约）, couples promise to stay together in sickness and in health. But a new study finds that the risk of divorce among older couples rises when the wife-not the husband—becomes seriously ill.
　　“Married women diagnosed with a serious health condition may find themselves struggling with the impact of their disease while also experiencing the stress of divorce,” said researcher Amelia Karraker.
　　Karraker and co-author Kenzie Latham analyzed 20 years of data on 2,717 marriages from a study conducted by Indiana University since 1992. At the time of the first interview, at least one of the partners was over the age of 50.
　　The researchers examined how the onset（发生）of four serious physical illnesses affected marriages. They found that, overall, 31% of marriages ended in divorce over the period studied. The incidence of new chronic（慢性的）illness onset increased over time as well, with more husbands than wives developing serious health problems.
　　“We found that women are doubly vulnerable to marital break-up in the face of illness,” Karraker said. “They’re more likely to be widowed, and if they’re the ones who become ill, they’re more likely to get divorced.”
　　While the study didn’t assess why divorce is more likely when wives but not husbands become seriously ill, Karraker offers a few possible reasons. “Gender norms and social expectations about caregiving may make it more difficult for men to provide care to sick spouses,” Karraker said. “And because of the imbalance in marriage markets, especially in older ages, divorced men have more choices among prospective partners than divorced women.”
　　Given the increasing concern about health care costs for the aging population, Karraker believes policymakers should be aware of the relationship between disease and risk of divorce.
　　“Offering support services to spouses caring for their other halves may reduce marital stress and prevent divorce at older ages,” she said. “But it’s also important to recognize that the pressure to divorce may be health-related and that sick ex-wives may need additional care and services to prevent worsening health and increased health costs.”

46. What can we learn about marriage vows from the passage?
　　A) They may not guarantee a lasting marriage.
　　B) They are as binding as they used to be.
　　C) They are not taken seriously any more.
　　D) They may help couples tide over hard times.
47. What did Karraker and co-author Kenzie Latham find about elderly husbands?
　　A) They are generally not good at taking care of themselves.
　　B) They can become increasingly vulnerable to serious illnesses.
　　C) They can develop different kinds of illnesses just like their wives.
　　D) They are more likely to contract serious illnesses than their wives.
48. What does Karraker say about women who fall ill?
　　A) They are more likely to be widowed.
　　B) They are more likely to get divorced.
　　C) They are less likely to receive good care.
　　D) They are less likely to bother their spouses.
49. Why is it more difficult for men to take care of their sick spouses according to Karraker?
　　A) They are more accustomed to receiving care.
　　B) They find it more important to make money for the family.
　　C) They think it more urgent to fulfill their social obligations.
　　D) They expect society to do more of the job.
50. What does Karraker think is also important?
　　A) Reducing marital stress on wives.
　　B) Stabilizing old couples’ relations.
　　C) Providing extra care for divorced women.
　　D) Making men pay for their wives’ health costs.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　If you were like most children, you probably got upset when your mother called you by a sibling’s(兄弟姐妹的)name. How could she not know you? Did it mean she loved you less?
　　Probably not. According to the first research to tackle this topic head-on, misnaming the most familiar people in our life is a common cognitive (认知的)error that has to do with how our memories classify and store familiar names.
　　The study, published online in April in the journal Memory and Cognition, found that the “wrong” name is not random but is invariably fished out from the same relationship pond: children, siblings, friends. The study did not examine the possibility of deep psychological significance to the mistake, says psychologist David Rubin, “but it does tell us who’s in and who’s out of the group.”
　　The study also found that within that group, misnamings occurred where the names shared initial or internal sounds, like Jimmy and Joanie or John and Bob. Physical resemblance between people was not a factor. Nor was gender.
　　The researchers conducted five separate surveys of more than 1,700 people. Some of the surveys included only college students; others were done with a mixed-age population. Some asked subjects about incidents where someone close to them—family or friend—had called them by another person’s name. The other surveys asked about times when subjects had themselves called someone close to them by the wrong name. All the surveys found that people mixed up names within relationship groups such as grandchildren, friends and siblings but hardly ever crossed these boundaries.
　　In general, the study found that undergraduates were almost as likely as old people to make this mistake and men as likely as women. Older people and women made this mistake and men as likely as women. Older people and women made the mistake slightly more often, but that may be because grandparents have more grandchildren to mix up than parents have children. Also, mothers may call on their children more often than fathers, given traditional gender norms. There was no evidence that errors occurred more when the misnamer was frustrated, tired or angry.

51.How might people often feel when they were misnamed?
　　A) Unwanted.
　　B) Unhappy.
　　C) Confused.
　　D) Indifferent.
52.What did David Rubin’s research find about misnaming?
　　A) It is related to the way our memories work.
　　B) It is a possible indicator of a faulty memory.
　　C) It occurs mostly between kids and their friends.
　　D) It often causes misunderstandings among people.
53. What is most likely the cause of misnaming?
　　A) Similar personality traits.
　　B) Similar spellings of names.
　　C) Similar physical appearance.
　　D) Similar pronunciation of names.
54. What did the surveys of more than 1,700 subjects find about misnaming?
　　A) It more often than not hurts relationships.
　　B) It hardly occurs across gender boundaries.
　　C) It is most frequently found in extended families.
　　D) It most often occurs within a relationship group.
55. Why do mothers misname their children more often than fathers?
　　A) They suffer more frustrations.
　　B) They become worn out more often.
　　C) They communicate more with their children.
　　D) They generally take on more work at home.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　Just because they can’t sing opera or ride a bicycle doesn’t mean that animals don’t have culture. There’s no better example of this than killer whales. As one of the most __26__ predators（食肉动物），killer whales may not fit the __27__ of a cultured creature. However, these beasts of the sea do display a vast range of highly __28__ behaviors that appear to be driving their genetic development.
　　The word “culture” comes from the Latin “colere,” which __29__ means “to cultivate.” In other words, it refers to anything that is __30__ or learnt, rather than instinctive or natural. Among human populations, culture not only affects the way we live, but also writes itself into our genes, affecting who we are. For instance, having spent many generations hunting the fat marine mammals of the Arctic, the Eskimos of Greenland have developed certain genetic __31__ that help them digest and utilize this fat-rich diet, thereby allowing them to __32__ in their cold climate.
　　Like humans, killer whales have colonized a range of different __33__ across the globe, occupying every ocean basin on the planet, with an empire that __34__ from pole to pole. As such, different populations of killer whales have had to learn different hunting techniques in order to gain the upper hand over their local prey（猎物）. This, in turn, has a major effect on their diet, leading scientists to __35__ that the ability to learn population-specific hunting methods could be driving the animals’ genetic development.

Living with parents edges out other living arrangements for 18-to 34-year-olds
A)Broad demographic (人口的) shifts in marital status, educational attainment and employment have transformed the way young adults in the U.S. are living, and a new Pew Research Center analysis highlights the implications of these changes for the most basic element of their lives—where they call home. In 2014, for the first time in more than 130 years, adults aged 18 to 34 were slightly more likely to be living in their parents’ home than they were to be living with a spouse or partner in their own household.
B) This turn of events is fueled primarily by the dramatic drop in the share of young Americans who are choosing to settle down romantically before age 35. Dating back to 1880, the most common living arrangement among young adults has been living with a romantic partner, whether a spouse or a significant other. This type of arrangement peaked around 1960, when 62% of the nation’s 18-to 34-year-olds were living with a spouse or partner in their own household, and only one-in-five were living with their parents.
C) By 2014, 31.6% of young adults were living with a spouse or partner in their own household, below the share living in the home of their parent(s) (32.1%). Some 14% of young adults lived alone, were a single parent or lived with one or more roommates. The remaining 22% lived in the home of another family member (such as a grandparent, in-law or sibling (兄弟姐妹) , a non-relative, or in group quarters like college dormitories.
D) It’s worth noting that the overall share of young adults living with their parents   was not at a record high in 2014. This arrangement peaked around 1940, when about 35% of the nation’s 18-to 34-year-olds lived with mom and/or dad (compared with 32% in 2014). What has changed, instead, is the relative share adopting different ways of living in early adulthood, with the decline of romantic coupling pushing living at home to the top of a much less uniform list of living arrangements.
E) Among young adults, living arrangements differ significantly by gender. For men aged 18 to 34, living at home with mom and/or dad has been the dominant living arrangement since 2009, In 2014, 28% of young men were living with a spouse of partner in their own home, while 35% were living in the home of their parent(s). Young women, however, are still more likely to be living with a spouse of romantic partner (35%) than they are to be living with their parent (s) (29%).
F) In 2014, more young women (16%) than young men (13%) were heading up a household without a spouse or parther. This is mainly because women are more likely than men to be single parents living with their children. For their part, young men (25%) are more likely than young women (19%) to be living in the home of another family member, a non-relative or in some type of group quarters.
G)A variety of factors contribute to the long-run increase in the share of young adults living with their parents. The first is the postponement of, if not retreat from, marriage.  The average age of first marriage has risen steadily for decades. In addition, a growing share of young adults may be avoiding marriage altogether. A previous Pew Research Center analysis projected that as many as one-in-four of today’s young adults may never marry. While cohabitation（同居）has been on the rise, the overall share of young adults either married or living with an unmarried partner has substantially fallen since 1990.
H) In addition, trends in both employment status and wages have likely contributed to the growing share of young adults who are living in the home of their parent(s), and this is especially true of young men. Employed young men are much less likely to live at   home than young men without a job, and employment among young men has fallen significantly in recent decades. The share of young men with jobs peaked around 1960 at 84%. In 2014, only 71% of 18-to 34-year-old men were employed. Similarly with earnings, young men’s wages (after adjusting for inflation) have been on a downward trajectory (轨迹) since 1970 and fell significantly from 2000 to 2010. As wages have fallen, the share of young men living in the home of their parent(s) has risen.
I) Economic factors seem to explain less of why young adult women are increasingly likely to live at home. Generally, young women have had growing success in the paid  labor market since 1960 and hence might increasingly be expected to be able to afford to afford to live independently of their parents. For women, delayed marriage—which is related, in part, to labor market outcomes for men—may explain more of the increase in their living in the family home.
G) The Great Recession (and modest recovery) has also been associated with an increase in young adults living at home. Initially in the wake of the recession, college enrollments expanded, boosting the ranks of young adults living at home. And given the weak job opportunities facing young adults, living at home was part of the private safety net helping young adults to weather the economic storm.
J) Beyond gender, young adult’s living arrangements differ considerably by education—which is tied to financial means. For young adults without a bachelor’s degree, as of 2008 living at home with their parents was more prevalent than living with a romantic partner. By 2014, 36% of 18-to 34-year-olds who had not completed a bachelor’s degree were living with their parent(s) while 27% were living with a spouse or partner. Among college graduates, in 2014 46% were married or living with a partner, and only 19% were living with their parent(s). Young adults with a college degree have fared much better in the labor market than their less-educated counterparts, which has in turn made it easier to establish their own households.

36.Unemployed young men are more likely to live with their parents than the employed.
37.In 2014, the percentage of men aged 18 to 34 living with their parents was greater than that of their female counterparts.
38.The percentage of young people who are married or live with a partner has greatly decreased in the past three decades or so.
39.Around the mid-20th century, only 20 percent of 18- to 34-year-old lived in their parents’ home.
40.Young adults with a college degree found it easier to live independently of their parents.
41.Young men are less likely to end up as single parents than young women.
42.More young adult women live with their parents than before due to delayed marriage.
43.The percentage of young men who live with their parents has grown due to their decreased pay in recent decades.
44.The rise in the number of college students made more young adults live with their parents.
45.One reason for young adults to live with their parents is that get married late or stay single all their lives.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　According to the majority of Americans, women are every bit as capable of being good political leaders as men. The same can be said of their ability to dominate the corporate boardroom. And according to a new Pew Research Center survey on women and leadership, most Americans find women indistinguishable from men on key leadership traits such as intelligence and capacity for innovation, with many saying they’re stronger than men in terms of being passionate and organized leaders.
　　So why, then, are women in short supply at the top of government and business in the United States? According to the public, at least, it’s not that they lack toughness, management talent or proper skill sets.
　　It’s also not all about work-life balance. Although economic research and previous survey findings have shown that career interruptions related to motherhood may make it harder for women to advance in their careers and compete for top executive jobs, relatively few adults in the recent survey point to this as a key barrier for women seeking leadership roles. Only about one-in-five say women’s family responsibilities are a major reason why there aren’t more females in top leadership positions in business and politics.
　　Instead, topping the list of reasons, about four-in-ten Americans point to a double standard for women seeking to climb to the highest levels of either politics or business, where they have to do more than their male counterparts to prove themselves. Similar shares say the electorate(选民)and corporate America are just not ready to put more women in top leadership positions.
　　As a result, the public is divided about whether the imbalance in corporate America will change in the foreseeable future, even though women have made major advances in the workplace. While 53% believe men will continue to hold more top executive positions in business in the future, 44% say it’s only a matter of time before as many women are in top executive positions as men. Americans are less doubtful when it comes to politics: 73% expect to see a female president in their lifetime.

46.What do most Americans think of women leaders according to a new Pew Research Center survey?
　　A) They have to do more to distinguish themselves.
　　B) They have to strive harder to win their positions.
　　C) They are stronger than men in terms of willpower.
　　D) They are just as intelligent and innovative as men.
47.What do we learn from previous survey findings about women seeking leadership roles?
　　A) They have unconquerable difficulties on their way to success.
　　B) They are lacking in confidence when competing with men.
　　C) Their failures may have something to do with family duties.
　　D) Relatively few are hindered in their career advancement.
48.What is the primary factor keeping women from taking top leadership positions according to the recent survey?
　　A) Personality traits.
　　B) Family responsibilities.
　　C) Gender bias.
　　D) Lack of vacancies.
49.What does the passage say about corporate America in the near future?
　　A) More and more women will sit in the boardroom.
　　B) Gender imbalance in leadership is likely to change.
　　C) The public is undecided about whether women will make good leaders.
　　D) People have opposing opinions as to whether it will have more women leaders.
50.What do most Americans expect to see soon on America’s political stage?
　　A) A woman in the highest position of government.
　　B) More and more women actively engaged in politics.
　　C) A majority of women voting for a female president.
　　D) As many women in top government positions as men.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　People have grown taller over the last century, with South Korean women shooting up by more than 20cm on average, and Iranian men gaining 16.5cm. A global study looked at the average height of 18-year-olds in 200 countries between 1914 and 2014.
　　The results reveal that while Swedes were the tallest people in the world in 1914, Dutch men have risen from 12th place to claim top spot with an average height of 182.5cm. Latvian women， meanwhile, rose from 28th place in 1914 to become the tallest in the world a century later, with an average height of 169.8cm.
　　James Bentham, a co-author of the research from Imperial College, London, says the global trend is likely to be due primarily to improvements in nutrition and healthcare. “An individual’s genetics has a big influence on their height, but once you average over whole populations, genetics plays a less key role,” he added.
　　A little extra height brings a number of advantages, says Elio Riboli of Imperial College. “Being taller is associated with longer life expectancy,” he said. “This is largely due to a lower risk of dying of cardiovascular（心血管的）disease among taller people.”
　　But while height has increased around the world, the trend in many countries of north and sub-Saharan Africa causes concern, says Riboli. While height increased in Uganda and Niger during the early 20th century, the trend has reversed in recent years, with height decreasing among 18-year-olds.
　　“One reason for these decreases in height is the economic situation in the 1980s,” said Alexander Moradi of the University of Sussex. The nutritional and health crises that followed the policy of structural adjustment, he says, led to many children and teenagers failing to reach their full potential in terms of height.
　　Bentham believes the global trend of increasing height has important implications. “How tall we are now is strongly influenced by the environment we grew up in,” he said. “If we give children the best possible start in life now, they will be healthier and more productive for decades to come.”

51. What does the global study tell us about people’s height in the last hundred years?
　　A）There is a remarkable difference across continents.
　　B）There has been a marked increase in most countries.
　　C）The increase in people’s height has been quickening.
　　D）The increase in women’s height is bigger than in men’s.
52. What does James Bentham say about genetics in the increase of people’s height?
　　A）It counts less than generally thought.
　　B）It outweighs nutrition and healthcare.
　　C）It impacts more on an individual than on a population.
　　D）It plays a more significant role in females than in males.
53. What does Elio Riboli say about taller people?
　　A）They tend to live longer.
　　B）They enjoy an easier life.
　　C）They generally risk fewer fatal diseases.
　　D）They have greater expectations in life.
54. What do we learn about 18-year-olds in Uganda and Niger?
　　A) They grow up slower than their peers in other countries.
　　B) They are actually shorter than their earlier generations.
　　C) They find it hard to bring their potential into full play.
　　D) They have experienced many changes of government.
55. What does James Bentham suggest we do?
　　A) Watch closely the global trend in children’s development.
　　B) Make sure that our children grow up to their full height.
　　C) Try every means possible to improve our environment.
　　D) Ensure our children grow up in an ideal environment.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　Ships are often sunk in order to create underwater reefs (暗礁)perfect for scuba diving (水肺式潜泳)and preserving marine  26   Turkish authorities have just sunk something a little different than a ship, and it wouldn’t normally ever touch water, an Airbus A300. The hollowed-out A300 was   27   of everything potentially harmful to the environment and sunk off the Aegean coast today. Not only will the sunken plane   28   the perfect skeleton for artificial reef growth, but authorities hope this new underwater attraction will bring tourists to the area.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Make Stuff, Fail, And Learn While You’re At It
A) We’ve always been a hands-on, do-it-yourself kind of nation. Ben Franklin, one of America’s founding fathers, didn’t just invent the lightning rod. His creations include  glasses, innovative stoves and more.
B) Franklin, who was largely self-taught, may have been a genius, but he wasn’t really an exception when it comes to American making and creativity.
C) The personal computing revolution and philosophy of disruptive innovation of Silicon Valley grew, in part, out of the creations of the Homebrew Computer Club, Which was founded in a garage in Menlo Park, California, in the mid-1970s. Members — including guys named Jobs and Wozniak — started making and inventing things they couldn’t buy.
D) So it’s no surprise that the Maker Movement today is thriving in communities and some schools across America. Making is available to ordinary people who aren’t tied to big companies, big defense labs or research universities. The maker philosophy echoes old ideas advocated by John Dewey, Montessori, and even ancient Greek philosophers, as we pointed out recently.
E) 	These maker spaces are often outside of classrooms, and are serving an important educational function. The Maker Movement is rediscovering learning by doing, which is Dewey’s phrase from 100 years ago. We are rediscovering Dewey and Montessori and a lot of the practices that they pioneered that have been forgotten or at least put aside. A maker space is a place which can be in a school, but it doesn’t look like a classroom. It can be in a library. It can be out in the community. It has tools and materials. It’s a place where you get to make things based on your interest and on what you’re learning to do.
F) 	Ideas about learning by doing have struggled to become mainstream educationally, despite being old concepts from Dewey and Montessori, Plato and Aristotle, and in the American Contcxt, Ralph Emerson, on the value of experience and self-reliance. It’s not necessarily an efficient way to learn. We learn, in a sense, by trial and error. Learning from experience is something that takes time and patience. It’s very individualized. If your goal is to have standardized approaches to learning, where everybody learns the same thing at the same time in the same way, then learning by doing doesn’t really fit that mold anymore. It’s not the world of textbooks. It’s not the world of testing.
G) 	Learning by doing may not be efficient, but it is effective. Project-based learning has grown in popularity with teachers and administrators. However, project-based learning is not making. Although there is a connection, there is also a distinction. The difference lies in whether the project is in a sense defined and developed by the student or whether it’s assigned by a teacher. We’ll all get the kids to build a small boat. We are all going to learn about X, Y, and Z. That tends to be one form of project-based learning.
H) 	I really believe the core idea of making is to have an idea within your head — or you just borrow it from someone—and begin to develop it , repeat it and improve it. Then, realize that idea somehow. That thing that you make is valuable to you and you can share it with others. I’m interested in how these things are expressions of that person, their ideas, and their interactions with the world.
I) 	In some ways, a lot of forms of making in school trivialize（使变得无足轻重）making. The thing that you make has no value to you. Once you are done demonstrating whatever concept was in the textbook, you throw away the pipe cleaners, the straws, the cardboard tubes.
J) 	Making should be student-directed and student-led, otherwise it’s boring. It doesn’t have the motivation of the student. I’m not saying that students should not learn concepts or not learn skills. They do. But to really harness their motivation is to build upon their interest. It’s to let them be in control and to drive the car.
K) Teachers should aim to build a supportive, creative environment for students to do this work. A very social environment, where they are learning from each other. When they have a problem, it isn’t the teacher necessarily coming in to solve it. They are responsible for working through that problem. It might be they have to talk to other students in the class to help get an answer.
L) 	The teacher’s role is more of a coach or observer. Sometimes, to people, it sounds like this is a diminished role for teachers. I think it’s a heightened role. You’re ereating this environment, like a maker space. You have 20 kids doing different things. You are watching them and really it’s the human behaviors you’re looking at. Are they engaged? Are they developing and repeating their project? Are they stumbling (受挫)? Do they need something that they don’t have? Can you help them be aware of where they are?
M)	My belief is that the goal of making is not to get every kid to be hands-on, but it enables us to be good learners. It’s not the knowledge that is valuable; it’s the practice of learning new things and understanding how things work. These are processes that you are developing so that you are able, over time, to tackle more interesting problems, more challenging problems—problems that require many people instead of one person, and many skills instead of one.
N) 	If teachers keep it form-free and student-led, it can still be tied to a curriculum and an educational plan. I think a maker space is more like a library in that there are multiple subjects and multiple things that you can learn. What seems to be missing in school is how these subjects integrate, how they fit together in any meaningful way. Rather than saying, ‘This is science, over here is history,” I see schools taking this idea of projects and looking at: How do they support children in higher level learning?
O) 	I feel like this is a shift away from a subject matter-based curriculum to a more experiential curriculum or learning. It’s still in its early stages, but I think it’s shifting around not what kids learn but how they learn.
36.A maker space is where people make things according to their personal interests.
37.The teachers’ role is enhanced in a maker space as they have to monitor and facilitate during the process.
38.Coming up with an idea of one’s own or improving one from others is key to the concept of making.
39.Contrary to structured learning, learning by doing is highly individualized.
40.America is a nation known for the idea of making things by oneself.
41.Making will be boring unless students are able to take charge.
42.Making can be related to a project, but it is created and carried out by students themselves.
43.The author suggests incorporating the idea of a maker space into a school curriculum.
44.The maker concept is a modern version of some ancient philosophical ideas.
45.Making is not taken seriously in school when students are asked to make something meaningless to them based on textbooks.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　Most kids grow up learning they cannot draw on the walls. But it might be time to unlearn that training—this summer, a group of culture addicts, artists and community organizers are inviting New Yorkers to write all over the walls of an old house on Governor’s Island.
　　The project is called Writing On It All, and it’s a participatory writing project and artistic experiment that has happened on Governor’s Island every summer since 2013.
　　“Most of the participants are people who are just walking by or are on the island for other reasons, or they just kind of happen to be there,” Alexandra Chasin, artistic director of Writing On It All, tells Smithsonian.com.
　　The 2016 season runs through June 26 and features sessions facilitated by everyone from dancers to domestic workers. Each session has a theme, and participants are given a variety of materials and prompts and asked to cover surfaces with their thoughts and art. This year, the programs range from one that turns the house into a collaborative essay to one that explores the meaning of exile.
　　Governor’s Island is a national historic landmark district long used for military purposes. Now known as “New York’s shared space for art and play,” the island, which lies between Manhattan and Brooklyn in Upper New York Bay, is closed to cars but open to summer tourists who flock for festivals, picnics, adventures, as well as these “legal graffiti(涂鸦)” Sessions.
　　The notes and art scribbled(涂画) on the walls are an experiment in self-expression. So far, participants have ranged in age from 2 to 85. Though Chasin says the focus of the work is on the activity of writing, rather than the text that ends up getting written, some of the work that comes out of the sessions has stuck with her.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　Online programs to fight depression are already commercially available. While they sound efficient and cost-saving, a recent study reports that they are not effective, primarily because depressed patients are not likely to engage with them or stick with them.
　　The study looked at computer-assisted cognitive(认知的) behavioral therapy(CBT) and found that it was no more effective in treating depression than the usual care patients receive from a primary care doctor.
　　Traditional CBT is considered an effective form of talk therapy for depression, helping people challenge negative thoughts and change the way they think in order to change their mood and behaviors. However, online CBT programs have been gaining popularity, with the attraction of providing low-cost help wherever someone has access to a computer.
　　A team of researchers from the University of Y ork conducted a randomized(随机的) control trial with 691 depressed patients from 83 physician practices across England. The patients were split into three groups: one group received only usual care from a physician while the other two groups received usual care from a physician plus one of two computerized CBT programs. Participants were balanced across the three groups for age, sex, educational background, severity and duration of depression, and use of antidepressants(抗抑郁药).
　　After four months, the patients using the computerized CBT programs had no improvement in depression levels over the patients who were only getting usual care from their doctors.
　　“It’s an important, cautionary note that we shouldn’t get too carried away with the idea that a computer system can replace doctors and therapists,” says Christopher Dowrick, a professor of primary medical care at the University of Liverpool. “We do still need the human touch or the human interaction, particularly when people are depressed.”
　　Being depressed can mean feeling “lost in your own small, negative, dark world,” Dowrick says. Having a person, instead of a computer, reach out to you is particularly important in combating that sense of isolation. “When you’re emotionally vulnerable, you’re even more in need of a caring human being ,” he says.

51.What does the recent study say about online CBT programs?
　　A) Patients may not be able to carry them through for effective cure.
　　B) Patients cannot engage with them without the use of a computer.
　　C)They can save patients trouble visiting physicians.
　　D)They have been well received by a lot of patients.
52.What has made online CBT programs increasingly popular?
　　A) Their effectiveness in combating depression.
　　B) The low efficiency of traditional talk therapy.
　　C)Their easy and inexpensive access by patients.
　　D)The recommendation by primary care doctors.
53. What is the major finding by researchers at the University of York?
　　A) Online CBT programs are no more effective than regular care from physicians.
　　B) The process of treating depression is often more complicated than anticipated.
　　C) The combination of traditional CBT and computerized CBT is most effective.
　　C) Depression is a mental condition which is to be treated with extreme caution.
54. What is Professor Dowrick’s advice concerning online CBT programs?
　　A) They should not be neglected in primary care.
　　B) Their effectiveness should not be overestimated.
　　C) They should be used by strictly following instructions.
　　D) Their use should be encouraged by doctors and therapists.
55. What is more important to an emotionally vulnerable person?
　　A) A positive state of mind.
　　B) Appropriate medication.
　　C) Timely encouragement.
　　D) Human interaction.

Read the passage through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　When travelling overseas, do you buy water in plastic bottles or take your chances with tap water? Imagine you are wandering about on a Thai island or   26   the ruins of Angkor. It’s hot so you grab a bottle of water from a local vendor. It’s the safe thing to do, right? The bottle is   27  , and the label says “pure water”. But maybe what’s inside is not so   28  . Would you still be drinking it if you knew that more than 90 percent of all bottled water sold around the world   29   microplastics?
　　That’s the conclusion of a recently   30   study, which analysed 259 bottles from 11 brands sold in nine countries,   31   an average of 325 plastic particles per litre of water. These microplastics included a   32   commonly known as PET and widely used in the manufacture of clothing and food and   33   containers. The study was conducted at the State University of New York on behalf of Orb Media, a journalism organisation. About a million bottles are bought every minute, not only by thirsty tourists but also by many of the 2.1 billion worldwide who live with unsafe drinking water.
　　Confronted with this   34  , several bottled-water manufacturers including Nestle and Coca-Cola undertook their own studies using the same methodology. These studies showed that their water did contain microplastics, but far less than the Orb study suggested. Regardless, the World Health Organisation has launched a review into the   35   health risks of drinking water from plastic bottles.
A) adequate	I) natural
B) admiring	J) potential
C) contains	K) released
D) defending	L) revealing
E) evidence	M) sealed
F) instant	N) solves
G) liquid	O) substance
H) modified	

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
The quiet heroism of mail delivery
A)On Wednesday, a polar wind brought bitter cold to the Midwest. Overnight, Chicago reached a low of 21 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, making it slightly colder than Antarctica (南极洲）, Alaska, and the North Pole Wind chills were 64 degrees below zero in Park Rapids, Minnesota and 45 degrees below zero in Buffalo, North Dakota, according to the National Weather Service. Schools, restaurants, and businesses closed, and more than 1,000 flights were canceled.

B)Even the United States Postal Service (USPS) suspended mail delivery. “Due to this arctic outbreak and concerns for the safety of USPS employees,” USPS announced Wednesday morning, “the Postal Service is suspending delivery Jan. 30 in some 3-digit ZIP Code locations.” Twelve regions were listed as unsafe on Wednesday, on Thursday, eight remained.

C)As global surface temperatures increase, so does the likelihood of extreme weather. In 2018 alone, wildfires, volcanic, eruptions, hurricanes, mudslides, and other natural disasters cost at least $49 billion in the United States. As my colleague Vann Newkirk reported, Puerto Rico is still confronting economic and structural destruction and resource scarcity from 2017’s Hurricane Maria. Natural disasters can wreck a community’s infrastructure, disrupting systems for months or years. Some services, however, remind us that life will eventually return, in some form, to normal.
D)Days after the deadly 2017 wildfires in Santa Rosa, California, a drone (无人机）caught footage (连续镜头）of a USPS worker, Trevor Smith, driving through burned homes in that familiar white van, collecting mail in an affected area. The video is striking: The operation is familiar, but the scene looks like the end of the world. According to Rae Ann Haight, the program manager for the national-preparedness office at USPS, Smith was fulfilling a request made by some of the home owners to pick up any mail that was left untouched. For Smith, this was just another day on the job. “I followed my route like I normally do,” Smith told a reporter. “As I came across a box that was up but with no house, I checked, and there was mail—outgoing mail—in it. And so we picked those up and carried on.”

E)USPS has sophisticated emergency plans for natural disasters. Across the country, 285 emergency management teams are devoted to crisis control. These teams are trained annually using a framework known as the three Ps: people, property, product. After mail service stops due to weather, the agency’s top priority is ensuring that employees are safe. Then it evaluates the health of infrastructure, such as the roads that mail carriers drive on. Finally, it decides when and how to re-open operations. If the destruction is extreme, mail addressed to the area will get sent elsewhere. In response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, USPS redirected incoming New Orleans mail to existing mail facilities in Houston. Mail that was already processed in New Orleans facilities was moved to an upper floor so it would be protected from water damage.

F)As soon as it’s safe enough to be outside, couriers (邮递员) start distributing accumulated mail on the still-accessible routes. USPS urges those without standing addresses to file change-of-address forms with their new location. After Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, mail facilities were set up in dozens of locations across the country in the two weeks that USPS was unable to provide street delivery.

G)Every day, USPS processes, on average, 493.4 million pieces of mail—anything from postcards to Social Security checks to medicine. Spokespeople from both USPS and UPS told me all mail is important. But some mail can be extremely sensitive and timely. According to data released in January 2017, 56 percent of bills are paid online, which means that just under half of payments still rely on delivery services to be completed.

H)It can be hard to identify which parcels are carrying crucial items such as Social Security checks, but USPS and UPS try their best to prioritize sensitive material. They will coordinate with the Social Security Administration to make sure that Social Security checks reach the right people in a timely fashion. After Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael last fall, USPS worked with state and local election boards to make sure that absentee ballots were available and received or time.

I)Mail companies are logistics (物流）companies, which puts them in a special position to help when disaster strikes. In a 2011 USPS case study, the agency emphasized its massive infrastructure as a “unique federal asset” to be called upon in a disaster or terrorist attack. “I think we’re unique as a federal agency,” USPS official Mike Swigart told me, “because we’re in literally every community in this country…We’re obligated to deliver to that point on a daily basis.”

J)Private courier companies, which have more dollars to spend, use their expertise in logistics to help revitalize damaged areas after a disaster. For more than a decade, FedEx has supported the American Red Cross in its effort to get emergency supplies to areas affected by disasters, both domestically and internationally. In 2012, the company distributed more than 1,200 MedPacks to Medical Reserve Corps groups in California. They also donated space for 3.1 million pounds of charitable shipping globally. Last October, the company pledged $1 million in cash and transportation support for Hurricanes Florence and Michael. UPS's charitable arm, the UPS Foundation, uses the company’s logistics to help disaster-struck areas rebuild. “We realize that as a company with people, trucks, warehouses, we needed to play a larger role,” said Eduardo Martinez, the president of the UPS Foundation. The company employs its trucks and planes to deliver food, medicine, and water. The day before I spoke to Martinez in November, he had been touring the damage from Hurricane Michael in Florida with the American Red Cross. “We have an obligation to make sure our communities are thriving,” he said.

K)Rebuilding can take a long time, and even then, impressions of the disaster may still remain. Returning to a normal life can be difficult, but some small routines—mail delivery being one of them—may help residents remember that their communities are still their communities. “When they see that carrier back out on the street,” Swigart said, “that’s the first sign to them that life is starting to return to normal.”

36.The United States Postal Service has a system to ensure its employees’ safety.

37.One official says USPS is unique in that it has more direct reach to communities compared with other federal agencies.

38.Natural disasters can have a long-lasting impact on community life.

39. Mail delivery service is still responsible for the completion of almost half of payments.

40.The sight of a mailman on the street is a reassuring sign of life becoming normal again.

41.After Hurricane Katrina interrupted routine delivery, temporary mail service points were set up.

42.Postal service in some regions in the U.S. was suspended due to extreme cold weather.

43.Private postal companies also support disaster relief efforts by distributing urgent supplies.

44.A dedicated USPS employee was on the job carrying out duties in spite of extreme conditions.

45.Postal services work hard to identify items that require priority treatment.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　Professor Ashok Goel of Georgia Tech developed an artificially intelligent teaching assistant to help handle the enormous number of student questions in the online class, Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence. This online course is a core requirement of Georgia Tech’s online Master of Science in Computer Science program Professor Goel already had eight teaching assistants, but that wasn’t enough to deal with the overwhelming number of daily questions from students.
　　Many students drop out of online courses because of the lack of teaching support. When students feel isolated or confused and reach out with questions that go unanswered, their motivation to continue begins to fade. Professor Goel decided to do something to remedy this situation and his solution was to create a virtual assistant named Jill Watson, which is based on the IBM Watson platform.
　　Goel and his team developed several versions of Jill Watson before releasing her to the online forums. At first, the virtual assistant wasn’t too great. But Goel and his team sourced the online discussion forum to find all 40,000 questions that had ever been asked since the class was launched. Then they began to feed Jill with the questions and answers. After some adjustments, and sufficient time, Jill was able to answer the students’ questions correctly 97% of the time. The virtual assistant became so advanced and realistic that the students didn’t know she was a computer. The students, who were studying artificial intelligence, were interacting with the virtual assistant and couldn’t tell it apart from a real human being. Goel didn’t inform them about Jill’s true identity until April 26. The students were actually very positive about the experience.
　　The goal of Professor Goel’s virtual assistant next year is to take over answering 40% of all the questions posed by students on the online forum. The name Jill Watson will, of course, change to something else next semester. Professor Goel has a much rosier outlook on the future of artificial intelligence than, say, Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates or Steve Wozniak.

46. What do we learn about Knowledge-Based Artificial Intelligence?
A) It is a robot that can answer students' questions.
B) It is a course designed for students to learn online.
C) It is a high-tech device that revolutionizes teaching.
D) It is a computer program that aids student learning.

47. What problem did Professor Goel meet with?
A) His students were unsatisfied with the assistants.
B) His course was too difficult for the students.
C) Students' questions were too many to handle.
D) Too many students dropped out of his course.

48. What do we learn about Jill Watson?
A) She turned out to be a great success.   
B) She got along pretty well with students.
C) She was unwelcome to students at first.  
D) She was released online as an experiment.

49. How did the students feel about Jill Watson?
A) They thought she was a bit too artificial.
B) They found her not as capable as expected.
C) They could not but admire her knowledge.
D) They could not tell her from a real person.

50. What does Professor Goel plan to do next with Jill Watson?
A) Launch different versions of her online.
B) Feed her with new questions and answers.
C) Assign her to answer more of students’ questions.
D) Encourage students to interact with her more freely.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Thinking small, being engaging, and having a sense of humor don’t hurt. Those are a few of the traits of successful science crowdfunding efforts that emerge from a recent study that examined nearly 400 campaigns. But having a large network and some promotional skills may be more crucial.
　　Crowdfunding, raising money for a project through online appeals, has taken off in recent years for everything from making movies to producing water-saving gadgets. Scientists have tried to tap Internet donors, too, with mixed success. Some raised more than twice their goals, but others have fallen short of reaching even modest targets.
　　To determine what separates science crowdfunding triumphs from failures, a team led by science communications scholar Mike Schafer of the University of Zurich examined the content of the webpages for 371 recent campaigns.
　　Four traits stood out for those that achieved their goals, the researchers report in Public Understanding of Science. For one, they use a crowdfunding platform that specializes in raising money for science, and not just any kind of project. Although sites like Kickstarter take all comers, platforms such as Experiment. corn and Petridish org only present scientific projects. For another, they present the project with a funny video because good visuals and a sense of humor improved success. Most of them engage with potential donors, since projects that answered questions from interested donors fared better. And they target a small amount of money. The projects included in the study raised $4000 on average, with 30% receiving less than $1000. The more money a project sought, the lower the chance it reached its goal, the researchers found.
　　Other factors may also significantly influence a project’s success, most notably, the size of a scientist's personal and professional networks, and how much a researcher promotes a project on their own. Those two factors are by far more critical than the content on the page. Crowdfunding can be part of researchers’ efforts to reach the public, and people give because “they feel a connection to the person” who is doing the fundraising—not necessarily to the science.

51. What do we learn about the scientists trying to raise money online for their projects?
A) They did not raise much due to modest targets.
C) Not all of them achieved their anticipated goals.
B) They made use of mixed fundraising strategies.
D) Most of them put movies online for the purpose.
52. What is the purpose of Mike Schafer’s research of recent crowdfunding campaigns?
A) To create attractive content for science websites.
C) To help scientists to launch innovative projects.
B) To identify reasons for their different outcomes.
D) To separate science projects from general ones.
53. What trait contributes to the success of a crowdfunding campaign?
A) The potential benefit to future generations.
C) Its originality in addressing financial issues.
B) Its interaction with prospective donors.
D) The value of the proposed project.
54. What did the researchers think of the financial targets of crowdfunding projects?
A) They should be small to be successful.
C) They should be assessed with great care.
B) They should be based on actual needs.
D) They should be ambitious to gain notice.
55. What motivates people to donate in a crowdfunding campaign? 
A) The ease of access to the content of the webpage.
B) Their desire to contribute to the cause of science.
C) The significance and influence of the project itself.
D) Their feeling of connection to the scientists themselves.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.

　　Finally, some good news about airplane travel. If you are on a plane with a sick passenger, you are unlikely to get sick. That is the 26	 of a new study that looked at how respiratory (呼吸道）viruses    27   on airplanes. Researchers found that only people who were seated in the same row as a passenger with the flu, for example—or one row in front of or behind that individual—had a high risk of catching the illness. All other passengers had only a very    28   chance of getting sick, according to the findings. Media reports have not necessarily presented    29   information about the risk of getting infected on an airplane in the past. Therefore, these new findings should help airplane passengers to feel less    30   to catching respiratory infections while traveling by air.
　　Prior to the new study, little was known about the risks of getting    31   infected by common respiratory viruses, such as the flu or common cold, on an airplane, the researchers said. So, to    32   the risks of infection, the study team flew on 10 different    33   in the U.S. during the flu season. The researchers found that passengers sitting within two seats on    34   side of a person infected with the flu, as well as those sitting one row in front of or behind this individual, had about an 80 percent chance of getting sick. But other passengers were    35   safe from infection. They had a less than 3 percent chance of catching the flu.
A) accurate	I) nearby
B) conclusion	J) respond
C) directly	K) slim
D) either	L) spread
E) evaluate	M) summit
F) explorations	N) vividly
G) flights	O) vulnerable
H) largely	

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs.

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Is Breakfast Really the Most Important Meal of the Day?
L)Along with old classics like “carrots give you night vision” and “Santa doesn’t bring toys to misbehaving children”, one of the most well-worn phrases of tired parents everywhere is that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Many of us grow up believing that skipping breakfast is a serious mistake, even if only two thirds of adults in the UK eat breakfast regularly, according to the British Dietetic Association, and around three-quarters of Americans.

M)“The body uses a lot of energy stores for growth and repair through the night,” explains diet specialist Sarah Elder. “Eating a balanced breakfast helps to up our energy, as well as make up for protein and calcium used throughout the night.” But there’s widespread disagreement over whether breakfast should keep its top spot in the hierarchy (等级）of meals. There have been concerns around the sugar content of cereal and the food industry’s involvement in pro-breakfast research—and even one claim from an academic that breakfast is “dangerous”.

N)What’s the reality? Is breakfast a necessary start to the day or a marketing tactic by cereal companies? The most researched aspect of breakfast (and breakfast-skipping) has been its links to obesity. Scientists have different theories as to why there’s a relationship between the two. In one US study that analysed the health data of 50,000 people over seven years, researchers found that those who made breakfast the largest meal of the day were more likely to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than those who ate a large lunch or dinner. The researchers argued that breakfast helps reduce daily calorie intake and improve the quality of our diet—since breakfast foods are often higher in fibre and nutrients.

O) But as with any study of this kind, it was unclear if that was the cause—or if breakfast-skippers were just more likely to be overweight to begin with. To find out, researchers designed a study in which 52 obese women took part in a 12-weck weight loss programme. All had the same number of calories over the day, but half had breakfast, while the other half did not. What they found was that it wasn’t breakfast itself that caused the participants to lose weight: it was changing their normal routine.

P)If breakfast alone isn’t a guarantee of weight loss, why is there a link between obesity and breakfastskipping? Alexandra Johnstone, professor of appetite research at the University of Aberdeen, argues that it may simply be because breakfast-skippers have been found to be less knowledgeable about nutrition and health. “There are a lot of studies on the relationship between breakfast eating and possible health outcomes, but this may be because those who eat breakfast choose to habitually have health-enhancing behaviours such as regular exercise and not smoking,” she says.

Q)A 2016 review of 10 studies looking into the relationship between breakfast and weight management concluded there is “limited evidence” supporting or refuting (反驳）the argument that breakfast influences weight or food intake, and more evidence is required before breakfast recommendations can be used to help prevent obesity.

R)Researchers from the University of Surrey and University of Aberdeen are halfway through research looking into the mechanisms behind how the time we eat influences body weight. Early findings suggest that a bigger breakfast is beneficial to weight control. Breakfast has been found to affect more than just weight. Skipping breakfast has been associated with a 27% increased risk of heart disease, a 21% higher risk of type 2 diabetes in men, and a 20% higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women. One reason may be breakfast’s nutritional value partly because cereal is fortified (增加营养价值）with vitamins. In one study on the breakfast habits of 1,600 young people in the UK, researchers found that the fibre and micronutrient intake was better in those who had breakfast regularly. There have been similar findings in Australia, Brazil, Canada and the US.

S)Breakfast is also associated with improved brain function, including concentration and language use. A review of 54 studies found that eating breakfast can improve memory, though the effects on other brain functions were inconclusive. However, one of the review’s researchers, Mary Beth Spitznagel, says there is “reasonable” evidence breakfast does improve concentration—there just needs to be more research. “Looking at studies that tested concentration the number of studies showing a benefit was exactly the same as the number that found no benefit,” she says. “And no studies found that eating breakfast was bad for concentration.”

T)What’s most important, some argue, is what we eat for breakfast. High-protein breakfasts have been found particularly effective in reducing the Ionging for food and consumption later in the day, according to research by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. While cereal remains a firm favourite among breakfast consumers in the UK and US, a recent investigation into the sugar content of ‘adult’ breakfast cereals found that some cereals contain more than three-quarters of the recommended daily amount of free sugars in each portion, and sugar was the second or third highest ingredient in cereals.”

U)But some research suggests if we’re going to eat sugary foods, it's best to do it early. One study recruited 200 obese adults to take part in a 16-week-long diet, where half added dessert to their breakfast, and half didn’t. Those who added dessert lost an average of 40 pounds more—however, the study was unable to show the long-term effects. A review of 54 studies found that there is no consensus yet on what type of breakfast is healthier, and conclude that the type of breakfast doesn’t matter as much as simply eating something.

G)While there’s no conclusive evidence on exactly what we should be eating and when, the consensus is that we should listen to our own bodies and eat when we’re hungry. “Breakfast is most important for people who are hungry when they wake up,” Johnstone says. “Each body starts the day differently—and those individual differences need to be researched more closely,” Spitznagel says. “A balanced breakfast is really helpful, but getting regular meals throughout the day is more important to leave blood sugar stable through the day, which helps control weight and hunger levels,” says Elder. “Breakfast isn’t the only meal we should be getting right.”

46.According to one professor, obesity is related to a lack of basic awareness of nutrition and health.

47.Some scientists claim that people should consume the right kind of food at breakfast.

48.Opinions differ as to whether breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

49.It has been found that not eating breakfast is related to the incidence of certain diseases in some countries.

50.Researchers found it was a change in eating habits rather than breakfast itself that induced weight loss.

51.To keep oneself healthy, eating breakfast is more important than choosing what to eat.

52.It is widely considered wrong not to eat breakfast.

53.More research is needed to prove that breakfast is related to weight loss or food intake.

54.People who prioritise breakfasts tend to have lower calorie but higher nutritional intake.

55.Many studies reveal that eating breakfast helps people memorise and concentrate.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　Textbooks represent an 11 billion dollar industry, up from $8 billion in 2014. Textbook publisher Pearson is the largest publisher—of any kind—in the world.
　　It costs about $1 million to create a new textbook. A freshman textbook will have dozens of contributors, from subject-matter experts through graphic and layout artists to expert reviewers and classroom testers. Textbook publishers connect professors, instructors and students in ways that alternatives, such as open e-textbooks and open educational resources, simply do not. This connection happens not only by means of collaborative development, review and testing, but also at conferences where faculty regularly decide on their textbooks and curricula for the coming year.
　　It is true that textbook publishers have recently reported losses, largely due to students renting or buying used print textbooks. But this can be chalked up to the excessively high cost of their books—which has increased over 1, 000 percent since 1977. A restructuring of the textbook industry may well be in order. But this does not mean the end of the textbook itself.
　　While they may not be as dynamic as an iPad, textbooks are not passive or lifeless. For example, over the centuries, they have simulated (模拟）dialogues in a number of ways. From 1800 to the resent day, textbooks have done this by posing questions for students to answer inductively (归纳性地）. That means students are asked to use their individual experience to come up with answers to general questions. Today’s psychology texts, for example, ask: “How much of your personality do you think you inherited?” while ones in physics say: “How can you predict where the ball you tossed will land?”
　　Experts observe that “textbooks come in layers, something like an onion”. For an active learner, engaging with a textbook can be an interactive experience: Readers proceed at their own pace. They “customize” their books by engaging with different layers and linkages. Highlighting, Post-It notes, dog-ears and other techniques allow for further customization that students value in print books over digital forms of books.

46. What does the passage say about open educational resources?
A) They contribute to teaching as much as to learning.
B) They don’t profit as much as traditional textbooks do.
C) They can’t connect professors and students as textbooks do.
D) They compete fiercely for customers with textbook producers.

47. What is the main cause of the publishers’ losses?
A) Failure to meet student need.     C) Emergence of e-books.
B) Industry restructuring.          D) Falling sales.

48. What does the textbook industry need to do?
A) Reform its structures.            C) Find replacements for printed textbooks.
B) Cut its retail prices.              D) Change its business strategy periodically.

49. What are students expected to do in the learning process?
A) Think carefully before answering each question.
B) Ask questions based on their own understanding.
C) Answer questions using their personal experience.
D) Give answers showing their respective personality.

50. What do experts say about students using textbooks? 
A) They can digitalize the prints easily.
C) They can purchase customized versions.
B) They can learn in an interactive way.
D) They can adapt the material themselves.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　When we think of animals and plants, we have a pretty good way of dividing them into two distinct groups: one converts sunlight into energy and the other has to eat food to make its energy. Well, those dividing lines come crashing down with the discovery of a sea slug(海姑蛹）that’s truly half animal and half plant. It’s pretty incredible how it has managed to hijack the genes of the algae (藻类）on which it feeds. 
　　The slugs can manufacture chlorophyll, the green pigment (色素）in plants that captures energy from sunlight, and hold these genes within their body. The term kleptoplasty is used to describe the practice of using hijacked genes to create nutrients from sunlight. And so far, this green sea slug is the only known animal that can be truly considered solar-powered, although some animals do exhibit some plant-like behaviors. Many scientists have studied the green sea slugs to confirm that they are actually able to create energy from sunlight.
　　In fact, the slugs use the genetic material so well that they pass it on to their future generations . Their babies retain the ability to produce their own chlorophyll, though they can’t generate energy from sunlight until they’ve eaten enough algae to steal the necessary genes, which they can’t yet produce on their own.
　　“There’s no way on earth that genes from an alga should work inside an animal cell,” says Sidney Pierce from the University of South Florida. “And yet here, they do. They allow the animal to rely on sunshine for its nutrition. So if something happens to their food source, they have a way of not starving to death until they find more algae to eat.”
　　The sea slugs are so good at gathering energy from the sun that they can live up to nine months without having to eat any food. They get all their nutritional needs met by the genes that they’ve hijacked from the algae.

51.What is the distinctive feature of a sea slug?
A) It looks like both a plant and animal.
C) It converts some sea animals into plants.
B) It lives half on animals and half on plants.
D) It gets energy from both food and sunlight.

52. What enables the sea slug to live like a plant?
A) The genes it captures from the sea plant algae.
C) The mechanism by which it conserves energy.
B) The nutrients it hijacks from other species.
D) The green pigment it inherits from its ancestors.

53. What does the author say about baby sea slugs?
A) They can live without sunlight for a long time.   
B) They can absorb sunlight right after their birth.
C) They can survive without algae for quite some time.
D) They can produce chlorophyll on their own.

54. What does Sidney Pierce say about genes from an alga?
A) They are stolen from animals like the sea slug.
B) They can't function unless exposed to sunlight.
C) They don't usually function inside animal cells.
D) They can readily be converted to sea slug genes.

55. What do we learn about sea slugs from the passage? 
A) They behave the way most plant species do.
B) They can survive for months without eating.
C) They will turn into plants when they mature.
D) They will starve to death without sunlight.

A South Korean city designed for the future takes on a life of its own
[A] Getting around a city is one thing—and then there’s the matter of getting from one city to another. One vision of the perfect city of the future is a place that offers easy access to air travel. In 2011, a University of North Carolina business professor named John Kasarda published a book called Aerotropolis: The Way We’ll Live Next. Kasarda says future cities should be built intentionally around or near airports. The idea, as he has put it, is to offer businesses “rapid, long-distance connectivity on a massive scale.”

[B]“The 18th century really was a waterborne（水运的）century, the 19th century a rail century, the 20th century a highway, car, truck century—and the 21st century will increasingly be an aviation century, as the globe becomes increasingly connected by air,” Kasarda says. Songdo, a city built from scratch in South Korea, is one of Kasarda’s prime examples. It has existed for just a few years. “From the outset, it was designed on the basis of connectivity and competitiveness,” says Kasarda. “The government built the bridge directly from the airport to the Songdo International Business District. And the surface infrastructure was built at the same time as the new airport.

[C]Songdo is a stone’s throw from South Korea’s Incheon Airport, its main international hub (枢纽）. But it takes a lot more than a nearby airport to be a city of the future. Just building a place as an “international business district” doesn’t mean it will become one. Park Yeon Soo conceived (构想）this city of the future back in 1986. He considers Songdo his baby. Park sees himself as a visionary. Thirty years after he imagined the city, Park’s baby is close to 70 percent built, with 36,000 people living in the business district and 90,000 residents in greater Songdo. It’s about an hour outside Seoul, built on former tidal flats along the Yellow Sea. There’s a Coast Guard building and a tall trade tower, as well as a park, golf course and university.

[D]Chances are you’ve actually seen this place. Songdo appears in the most famous music video ever to come out of South Korea. “Gangnam Style” refers to the fashionable Gangnam district in Seoul. But some of the video was filmed in Songdo. “I don’t know if you remember, there was a scene in a subway station. That was not Gangnam. That was actually Songdo,” says Jung Won Son, a professor of urban development at London’s Bartlett School of Planning. “Part of the reason to shoot there is that it’s new and nice.”

[E]The city was supposed to be a hub for global companies, with employees from all over the world. But that’s not how it has turned out. Songdo’s reputation is as a futuristic ghost town. But the reality is more complicated. A bridge with big, light-blue loops leads into the business district. In the center of the main road, there’s a long line of flags of the world. On the comer, there’s a Starbucks and a 7-Eleven—all of the international brands that you see all over the world nowadays.

[F]The city is not empty. There are mothers pushing baby carriages, old women with walkers—even in the middle of the day, when it’s 90 degrees out. Byun Young-Jin chairs the Songdo real estate association and started selling property here when the first phase of the city opened in 2005. He says demand has boomed in the past couple of years. Most of his clients are Korean. In fact, the developer says, 99 percent of the homes here are sold to Koreans. Young families move here because the schools are great. And that’s the problem: Songdo has become a popular Korean city more popular as a residential area than a business one. It’s not yet the futuristic international business hub that planners imagined. “It’s a great place to live. And it’s becoming a great place to work,” says Scott Summers, vice president of Gale International, the developer of the city. The floor-to-ceiling windows of his company’s offices overlook Songdo Central Park, with a canal full of small boats and people fishing. Shimmering (闪烁的）glass towers line the canal’s edge.

[G]“What’s happened is that our focus on creating that quality of life first has enabled the residents to live here,” Summers says. But there needs to be strong economic incentives for companies to locate here. The city is still unfinished, and it feels a bit like a theme park. It doesn’t feel all that futuristic. There’s a high-tech underground trash disposal system. Buildings are environmentally friendly. Everybody’s television set is connected to a system that streams personalized language or exercise classes.

[H] But this is not Star Trek. And to some of the residents, Songdo feels hollow. “I’m, like, in prison for weekdays. That’s what we call it in the workplace,” says a woman in her 20s. She doesn’t want to use her name for fear of being fired from her job. She goes back to Seoul every weekend. “I say I’m prison-breaking on Friday nights.” But she has to make the prison break in her own car. There’s no high-speed train connecting Songdo to Seoul, just over 20 miles away.

[I] Park Y eon Soo, the man who first imagined Songdo, feels frustrated, too. He says he built South Korea a luxury vehicle, “like Mercedes or BMW. It’s a good car now. But we’re waiting for a good driver to accelerate.” But there are lots of other good cars out there, too. The world is dotted with futuristic, high-tech cities trying to attract the biggest international companies.

[J]Songdo’s backers contend that it’s still early, and business space is filling up—about 70 percent of finished offices are now occupied. Brent Ryan, who teaches urban design at MIT, says Songdo proves a universal principle. “There have been a lot of utopian (乌托邦的）cities in history. And the reason we don’t know about a lot of them is that they have vanished entirely.” In other words, when it comes to cities—or anything else—it is hard to predict the future.

36. Songdo’s popularity lies more in its quality of life than its business attraction.

37. The man who conceived Songdo feels disappointed because it has fallen short of his  expectations.

38.A scene in a popular South Korean music video was shot in Songdo.

39.Songdo still lacks the financial stimulus for businesses to set up shop there.

40.Airplanes will increasingly become the chief means of transportation, according to a professor.

41.Songdo has ended up different from the city it was supposed to be.

42.Some of the people who work in Songdo complain about boredom in the workplace.

43.A business professor says that a future city should have easy access to international transportation.

44.According to an urban design professor, it is difficult for city designers to foresee what will happen in the future.

45.Park Y eon Soo, who envisioned Songdo, feels a parental connection with the city.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　The fifth largest city in the US passed a significant soda tax proposal that will levy (征税) 1.5 cents per liquid ounce on distributors.
　　Philadelphia’s new measure was approved by a 13 to 4 city council vote. It sets a new bar for similar initiatives across the country. It is proof that taxes on sugary drinks can win substantial support outside super­liberal areas. Until now, the only city to successfully pass and implement a soda tax was Berkeley, California, in 2014.
　　The tax will apply to regular and diet sodas, as well as other drinks with added sugar, such as Gatorade and iced teas. It’s expected to raise $410 million over the next five years, most of which will go toward funding a universal prekindergarten program for the city.
　　While the city council vote was met with applause inside the council room, opponents to the measure, including soda lobbyists, made sharp criticisms and a promise to challenge the tax in court.
　　“The tax passed today unfairly singles out beverages—including low-and no-calorie choices,” said Lauren Kane, spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association. “But most importantly , it is against the law. So we will side with the majority of the people of Philadelphia who oppose this tax and take legal action to stop it.” 
　　An industry-backed anti-tax campaign has spent at least $4 million on advertisements. The ads criticized the measure, characterizing it as a “grocery tax.”
　　Public health groups applauded the approved tax as a step toward fixing certain lasting health issues that plague Americans. “The move to recapture a small part of the profits from an industry that pushes a product that contributes to diabetes, obesity and heart disease in poorer communities in order to reinvest in those communities will sure be inspirational to many other places,” said Jim Krieger, executive director of Healthy Food America. “Indeed, we are already hearing from some of them. It’s not ‘just Berkeley’ anymore.”
　　Similar measures in California’s Albany, Oakland, San Francisco and Colorado’s Boulder are becoming hotbutton issues. Health advocacy groups have hinted that even more might be coming.

46.What does the passage say about the newly-approved soda tax in Philadelphia?
A) It will change the lifestyle of many consumers.
B) It may encourage other US cities to follow suit.
C) It will cut soda consumption among low-income communities.
D) It may influence the marketing strategies of the soda business.

47. What will the opponents probably do to respond to the soda tax proposal?
A) Bargain with the city council.   B) Refuse to pay additional tax.
C) Take legal action against it.     D) Try to win public support.

48. What did the industry-backed anti-tax campaign do about the soda tax proposal?
A) It tried to arouse hostile feelings among consumers. 
B) It tried to win grocers’ support against the measure.
C) It kept sending letters of protest to the media. 
D) It criticized the measure through advertising.

49. What did public health groups think the soda tax would do?
A) Alert people to the risk of sugar induced diseases. 
B) Help people to fix certain long-time health issues.
C) Add to the fund for their research on diseases. 
D) Benefit low-income people across the country.

50. What do we learn about similar measures concerning the soda tax in some other cities?
A) They are becoming rather sensitive issues.
B) They are spreading panic in the soda industry.
C) They are reducing the incidence of sugar-induced diseases.
D) They are taking away a lot of profit from the soda industry.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　Popping food into the microwave for a couple of minutes may seem utterly harmless, but Europe’s stock of these quick-cooking ovens emit as much carbon as nearly 7 million cars, a new study has found. And the problem is growing. With costs falling and kitchen appliances becoming “status” items, owners are throwing away microwaves after an average of eight years. This is pushing sales of new microwaves which are expected to reach 135 million annually in the EU by the end of the decade.
　　A study by the University of Manchester calculated the emissions of CO2—the main greenhouse gas responsible for climate change—at every stage of microwaves, from manufacture to waste disposal. “It is electricity consumption by microwaves that has the biggest impact on the environment,” say the authors. The authors also calculate that the emissions from using 19 microwaves over a year are the same as those from using a car. According to the same study, efforts to reduce consumption should focus on improving consumer awareness and behaviour. For example, consumers could use appliances in a more efficient way by adjusting the time of cooking to the type of food.
　　However, David Reay, professor of carbon management, argues that, although microwaves use a great deal of energy, their emissions are minor compared to those from cars. In the UK alone, there are around 30 million cars. These cars emit more than all the microwaves in the EU. Backing this up, recent data show that passenger cars in the UK emitted 69 million tons of CO2 in 2015. This is 10 times the amount this new microwave oven study estimates for annual emissions for all the microwave ovens in the EU. Further, the energy used by microwaves is lower than any other form of cooking. Among common kitchen appliances used for cooking, microwaves are the most energy efficient, followed by a stove and finally a standard oven. Thus, rising microwave sales could be seen as a positive thing.

51. What is the finding of the new study?
A) Quick-cooking microwave ovens have become more popular.
B) The frequent use of microwaves may do harm to our health.
C) CO2 emissions constitute a major threat to the environment.
D) The use of microwaves emits more CO2 than people think.

52. Why are the sales of microwaves expected to rise?
A) They are becoming more affordable.
B) They have a shorter life cycle than other appliances.
C) They are getting much easier to operate.
D) They take less time to cook than other appliances.

53. What recommendation does the study by the University of Manchester make?
A) Cooking food of different varieties.      B) Improving microwave users’ habits.
C) Eating less to cut energy consumption.    D) Using microwave ovens less frequently.

54. What does Professor David Reay try to argue?
A) There are far more emissions from cars than from microwaves.
B) People should be persuaded into using passenger cars less often.
C) The UK produces less CO2 than many other countries in the EU.
D) More data are needed to show whether microwaves are harmful.

55. What does Professor David Reay think of the use of microwaves?
A) It will become less popular in the coming decades.
B) It makes everyday cooking much more convenient.
C) It plays a positive role in environmental protection.
D) It consumes more power than conventional cooking.

How to Eat Well
A)Why do so many Americans eat tons of processed food, the stuff that is correctly called junk (垃圾) and should really carry warning labels?

B)It’s not because fresh ingredients are hard to come by. Supermarkets offer more variety than ever, and there are over four times as many farmers markets in the US as there were 20 years ago. Nor is it for lack of available information. There are plenty of recipes (食谱), how-to videos and cooking classes available to anyone who has a computer, smartphone or television. If anything, the information is overwhelming.

C)And yet we aren’t cooking. If you eat three meals a day and behave like most Americans, you probably get at least a third of your daily calories (卡路里) outside the home. Nearly two-thirds of us grab fast food once a week, and we get almost 25% of our daily calories from snacks. So we’re eating out or taking in, and we don’t sit down—or we do, but we hurry.

D)Shouldn’t preparing—and consuming—food be a source of comfort, pride, health, well-being, relaxation, sociability? Something that connects us to other humans? Why would we want to outsource（外包）this basic task, especially when outsourcing it is so harmful?

E)When I talk about cooking, I’m not talking about creating elaborate dinner parties or three-day science projects. I’m talking about simple, easy, everyday meals. My mission is to encourage green hands and those lacking time or memory to feed themselves. That means we need modest, realistic expectations, and we need to teach people to cook food that’s good enough to share with family and friends.

F)Perhaps a return to real cooking needn’t be far off. A recent Harris poll revealed that 79% of Americans say they enjoy cooking and 30% “love it”; 14% admit to not enjoying kitchen work and just 7% won’t go near the stove at all. But this doesn’t necessarily translate to real cooking, and the result of this survey shouldn’t surprise anyone: 52% of those 65 or older cook at home five or more times per week; only a third of young people do.

G)Back in the 1950s most of us grew up in households where Mom cooked virtually every night. The intention to put a home-cooked meal on the table was pretty much universal. Most people couldn’t afford to do otherwise.

H)Although frozen dinners were invented in the ’40s, their popularity didn’t boom until televisions became popular a decade or so later. Since then, packaged, pre-prepared meals have been what’s for dinner. The microwave and fast-food chains were the biggest catalysts（催化剂）, but the big food companies—which want to sell anything except the raw ingredients that go into cooking—made the home cook an endangered species.

I)Still, I find it strange that only a third of young people report preparing meals at home regularly. Isn’t this the same crowd that rails against processed junk and champions craft cooking? And isn’t this the generation who say they’re concerned about their health and the well-being of the planet? If these are truly the values of many young people, then their behavior doesn’t match their beliefs.

J)There have been half-hearted but well-publicized efforts by some food companies to reduce calories in their processed foods, but the Standard American Diet is still the polar opposite of the healthy, mostly plant-based diet that just about every expert says we should be eating. Considering that the government’s standards are not nearly ambitious enough, the picture is clear: by not cooking at home, we’re not eating the right things, and the consequences are hard to overstate.

K)To help quantify (量化) the costs of a poor diet, I recently tried to estimate this impact in terms of a most famous food, the burger（汉堡包）. I concluded that the profit from burgers is more than offset by the damage they cause in health problems and environmental harm.

L)Cooking real food is the best defense—not to mention that any meal you’re likely to eat at home contains about 200 fewer calories than one you would eat in a restaurant.

M)To those Americans for whom money is a concern, my advice is simple: Buy what you can afford, and cook it yourself. The common prescription is to primarily shop the grocery store, since that’s where fresh produce, meat and seafood, and dairy are. And to save money and still eat well you don’t need local, organic ingredients; all you need is real food. I’m not saying local food isn’t better; it is. But there is plenty of decent food in the grocery stores.

N)The other sections you should get to know are the frozen foods and the canned goods. Frozen produce is still produce; canned tomatoes are still tomatoes. Just make sure you’re getting real food without tons of added salt or sugar. Ask yourself, would Grandma consider this food? Does it look like something that might occur in nature? It’s pretty much common sense: you want to buy food, not unidentifiable foodlike objects.

O)You don’t have to hit the grocery store daily, nor do you need an abundance of skill. Since fewer than half of Americans say they cook at an intermediate level and only 20% describe their cooking skills as advanced, the crisis is one of confidence. And the only remedy for that is practice. There’s nothing mysterious about cooking the evening meal. You just have to do a little thinking ahead and redefine what qualifies as dinner. Like any skill, cooking gets easier as you do it more: every time you cook, you advance your level of skills. Someday you won’t even need recipes. My advice is that you not pay attention to the number of steps and ingredients, because they can be deceiving.

P)Time, I realize, is the biggest obstacle to cooking for most people. You must adjust your priorities to find time to cook. For instance, you can move a TV to the kitchen and watch your favorite shows while you’re standing at the sink. No one is asking you to give up activities you like, but if you’re watching food shows on TV, try cooking instead.

56.Cooking benefits people in many ways and enables them to connect with one another.

57.Abundant information about cooking is available either online or on TV.

58.Young people do less cooking at home than the elderly these days.

59. Cooking skills can be improved with practice.

60.In the mid-20th century, most families ate dinner at home instead of eating out.

61.Even those short of time or money should be encouraged to cook for themselves and their family.

62.Eating food not cooked by ourselves can cause serious consequences.

63.To eat well and still save money, people should buy fresh food and cook it themselves.

64.We get a fairly large portion of calories from fast food and snacks.

65.The popularity of TV led to the popularity of frozen food.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.

Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　The wallet is heading for extinction. As a day-to-day essential, it will die off with the generation who read print newspapers. The kind of shopping where you hand over notes and count out change in return now happens only in the most minor of our retail encounters, like buying a bar of chocolate or a pint of milk, from a corner shop. At the shops where you spend any real money, that money is increasingly abstracted. And this is more and more true, the higher up the scale you go. At the most cutting-edge retail stores Victoria Beckham on Dover Street, for instance you don’t go and stand at any kind of cash register, when you decide to pay. The staff are equipped with ipads to take your payment while you relax on a sofa. 
　　Which is nothing more or less than excellent service, if you have the money. But across society, the abstraction of the idea of cash makes me uneasy. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned. But earning money isn’t quick or easy for most of us. Isn’t it a bit weird that spending it should happen in half a blink（眨眼）of an eye? Doesn’t a wallet—that time-honoured Friday-night feeling of pleasing, promising fatness—represent something that matters?
　　But I’ll leave the economics to the experts. What bothers me about the death of the wallet is the change it represents in our physical environment. Everything about the look and feel of a wallet—the way the fastenings and materials wear and tear and loosen with age, the plastic and paper and gold and silver, and handwritten phone numbers and printed cinema tickets—is the very opposite of what our world is becoming. The opposite of a wallet is a smartphone or an iPad. The rounded edges, cool glass, smooth and unknowable as a pebble（鹅卵石）. Instead of digging through pieces of paper and peering into corners, we move our fingers left and right. No more counting out coins. Show your wallet, if you still have one. It may not be here much longer.

46. What is happening to the wallet?
A) It is disappearing.             C) It is becoming costly.
B) It is being fattened.            D) It is changing in style.

47. How are business transactions done in big modern stores?
A) Individually.                  C) In the abstract.
B) Electronically.                 D) Via cash register.

48. What makes the author feel uncomfortable nowadays?
A) Saving money is becoming a thing of the past.   
B) The pleasing Friday-night feeling is fading.
C) Earning money is getting more difficult.  
D) Spending money is so fast and easy.

49. Why does the author choose to write about what’s happening to the wallet?
A) It represents a change in the modern world.
B) It has something to do with everybody’s life.
C) It marks the end of a time-honoured tradition.
D) It is the concern of contemporary economists.

50. What can we infer from the passage about the author?
A) He is resistant to social changes.
B) He is against technological progress.
C) He feels reluctant to part with the traditional wallet.
D) He feels insecure in the ever-changing modern world.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　It’s late in the evening: time to close the book and turn off the computer. You’re done for the day. What you may not realize, however, is that the learning process actually continues—in your dreams.
　　It might sound like science fiction, but researchers are increasingly focusing on the relationship between the knowledge and skills our brains absorb during the day and the fragmented, often bizarre imaginings they generate at night. Scientists have found that dreaming about a task we’ve learned is associated with improved performance in that activity (suggesting that there’s some truth to the popular notion that we’re “getting” a foreign language once we begin dreaming in it). What’s more, researchers are coming to recognize that dreaming is an essential part of understanding, organizing and retaining what we learn.
　　While we sleep, research indicates, the brain replays the patterns of activity it experienced during waking hours, allowing us to enter what one psychologist calls a neural（神经的）virtual reality. A vivid example of such replay can be seen in a video researchers made recently about sleep disorders. They taught a series of dance moves to a group of patients with conditions like sleepwalking, in which the sleeper engages in the kind physical movement that does not normally occur during sleep. They then videotaped the subjects as they slept, Lying in bed, eyes closed, one female patient on the tape performs the dance moves she learned earlier.
　　This shows that while our bodies are at rest, our brains are drawing what’s important from the information and events we’ve recently encountered, then integrating that data into the vast store of what we already know. In a 2010 study, researchers at Harvard Medical School reported that college students who dreamed about a computer maze（迷宫）task they had learned showed a 10-fold improvement in their ability to find their way through the maze compared with participants who did not dream about the task.
　　Robert Stickgold, one of the Harvard researchers, suggests that studying right before bedtime or taking a nap following a study session in the afternoon might increase the odds of dreaming about the material. Think about that as your head hits the pillow tonight.

51. What is scientists’ finding about dreaming?
A) It involves disconnected weird images.
B) It resembles fragments of science fiction.
C) Dreaming about a learned task betters its performance.
D) Dreaming about things being learned disturbs one’s sleep.

52. What happens when one enters a dream state?
A) The body continues to act as if the sleeper were awake.
B) The neural activity of the brain will become intensified.
C) The brain behaves as if it were playing a virtual reality video game.
D) The brain once again experiences the learning activities of the day.

53. What does the brain do while we are sleeping?
A) It systematizes all the data collected during the day.
B) It substitutes old information with new data.
C) It processes and absorbs newly acquired data.
D) It classifies information and places it in different files.

54. What does Robert Stickgold suggest about enhancing learning?
A) Having a little sleep after studying in the day.
B) Staying up late before going to bed.
C) Having a dream about anything.
D) Thinking about the odds of dreaming about the material.

55. What can be inferred about dreaming from the passage? 
A) We may enhance our learning through dreaming.
B) Dreaming improves your language ability.
C) All sleepwalkers perform dance moves when they are sleeping.
D) Taking a nap after learning can help you find the way through the maze.

　　There’re three main types of financial stress people encounter. The first type is apparent in people being stressed about the 26 ups and downs of investment markets—actually not so much the ups, but 27 the downs. These people are usually unable or unprepared to endure the long haul.
　　The next common type of financial stress is that caused by debt. In a 28 percentage of cases of debt-induced financial stress, credit cards and loans will be a central element. Often there’ll be a car loan and perhaps a mortgage, but credit cards often seem to be the gateway to debt-related financial difficulties for many.
　　The third type of stress and 29 the least known is inherited financial stress, which is the most destructive. It is experienced by those who have grown up in households where their parents regularly 30 and fought about money. Money therefore becomes a stressful topic, and so the thought of sitting down and planning is an unattractive 31.
　　Those suffering inherited financial anxiety 32 to follow one of two patterns. Either they put their head in the sand: they would 33 examining their financial statements, budgeting and discussing financial matters with those closest to them. Alternatively, they would go to the other 34, and micro-analyze everything, to the point of complete 35. They are convinced that whatever decision they make will be the wrong one.

Section B
Directions：In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by making the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.

Doctor’s Orders: Let Children Just Play
[A] Imagine a drug that could enhance a child’s creativity and critical thinking. Imagine that this drug were simple to make, safe to take, and could be had for free. The nation’s leading pediatricians（儿科医生）say this miracle compound exists. In a new clinical report, they are urging doctors to prescribe it liberally to the children in their care.

[B] “This may seem old-fashioned, but there are skills to be learned when kids aren’t told what to do,” said Dr. Michael Yogman, a Harvard Medical School pediatrician who led the drafting of the call to arms. Whether it’s rough physical play, outdoor play or social or pretend play, kids derive important lessons from the chance to make things up as they go, he said.

[C] The advice, issued Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics, may come as a shock to some parents. After spending years fretting（烦恼）over which toys to buy, which apps to download and which skill-building programs to send their kids to after school, letting them simply play—or better yet, playing with them—could seem like a step backward. The pediatricians insist that it’s not. The academy’s guidance does not include specific recommendations for the dosing of play. Instead, it asks doctors to advise parents before their babies turn two that play is essential to healthy development. 

[D] “Play is not silly behavior,” the academy’s report declares. It fosters children’s creativity, cooperation and problem-solving skills—all of which are critical for a 21st-century workforce. When parents engage in play with their children, it builds a wall against the harmful effects of all kinds of stress, including poverty, the academy says. In the pediatricians’ view, essentially every life skill that’s valued in adults can be built up with play. “Collaboration, negotiation, decision-making, creativity, leadership, and increased physical activity are just some of the skills and benefits children gain through play,” they wrote. The pediatricians’ appeal comes as kids are being squeezed by increasing academic demands at school and the constant invasion of digital media.

[E] The trends have been a long time coming. Between 1981 and 1997, detailed time-use studies showed that the time children spent at play declined by 25 percent. Since the adoption of sweeping education reforms in 2001, public schools have steadily increased the amount of time devoted to preparing for standardized tests. The focus on academic “skills and drills” has cut deeply into recess（课间休息）and other time for free play.

[F] By 2009, a study of Los Angeles kindergarten classrooms found that five-year-olds were so burdened with academic requirements that they were down to an average of just 19 minutes per day of “choice time,” when they were permitted to play freely with blocks, toys or other children. One in four Los Angeles teachers reported there was no time at all for “free play.” Increased academic pressures have left 30 percent of U.S. kindergarten classes without any recess. Such findings prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics to issue a policy statement in 2013 on the “crucial role of recess in school.”

[G] Pediatricians aren’t the only ones who have noticed. In a report titled “Crisis in the Kindergarten,” a group of educators, health professionals and child advocates called the loss of play in early childhood “a tragedy, both for the children themselves and for our nation and world.” Kids in play-based kindergartens “end up equally good or better at reading and other intellectual skills, and they are more likely to become well-adjusted healthy people,” the Alliance for Childhood said in 2009. Indeed, new research demonstrates why playing with blocks might have been time better spent, Yogman said. The trial assessed the effectiveness of an early mathematics intervention（干预）aimed at preschoolers. The results showed almost no gains in math achievement.

[H] Another playtime thief: the growing proportion of kids’ time spent in front of screens and digital devices, even among preschoolers. Last year, Common Sense Media reported that children up through age eight spent an average of two hours and 19 minutes in front of screens each day, including an average of 42 minutes a day for those under two. This increase of digital use comes with rising risks of obesity, sleep deprivation and cognitive（认知的）, language and social-emotional delays, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned in 2016.

[I] “I respect that parents have busy lives and it’s easy to hand a child an iPhone,” Yogman said. “But there’s a cost to that. For young children, it’s much too passive. And kids really learn better when they’re actively engaged and have to really discover things.”

[J] The decline of play is a special hazard for the roughly 1 in 5 children in the United States who live in poverty. These 14 million children most urgently need to develop the resilience（韧劲）that is cultivated with play. Instead, Yogman said, they are disproportionately affected by some of the trends that are making play scarce: academic pressures at schools that need to improve test scores, outside play areas that are limited or unsafe, and parents who lack the time or energy to share in playtime.

[K] Yogman also worries about the pressures that squeeze playtime for more affluent kids. “The notion that as parents we need to schedule every minute of their time is not doing them a great service,” he said. Even well-meaning parents may be “robbing them of the opportunity to have that joy of discovery and curiosity—the opportunity to find things out on their own.”

[L]Play may not be a hard sell to kids. But UCLA pediatrician Carlos Lerner acknowledged that the pediatricians’ new prescription may meet with skepticism（怀疑） from parents, who are anxious for advice on how to give their kids a leg up in the world. They should welcome the simplicity of the message, Lerner said. “It’s liberating to be able to offer them this advice: that you spending time with your child and letting him play is one of the most valuable things you can do,” he said. “It doesn’t have to involve spending a lot of money or time, or joining a parenting group. It’s something we can offer that’s achievable. They just don’t recognize it right now as particularly valuable.”

36. Increased use of digital devices steals away children’s playtime.

37. Since the beginning of this century, an increasing amount of time has been shifted in public schools from recess to academic activities.

38. It has been acknowledged that while kids may welcome pediatrician’s recommendation, their parents may doubt its feasibility.

39. According to some professionals, deprivation of young children’s playtime will do harm not only to children themselves but to the country and the world.

40. By playing with children, parents can prevent them from being harmed by stress.

41. Playing with digital device discourages kids from active discovery, according to pediatrician Dr. Michael Yogman.

42. The suggestion of letting children simply play may sound like going backwards to parents who want to help build their children’s skills.

43. Dr. Michael Yogman believes the idea that parents should carefully schedule children’s time may not be helpful to their growth.

44. One quarter of teachers in an American city said that children in kindergartens had no time for playing freely.

45. According to a pediatrician, no matter what kind of play children engage in, they are learning how to create things.

Section C
Directions：There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D) .You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
 
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
    Americans spend billions of dollars each year trying to change our weight with diets, gym memberships and plastic surgery.
    Trying to live up to the images of “perfect” models and movie heroes has a dark side: anxiety and depression, as well as unhealthy strategies for weight loss or muscle gain. It also has a financial cost. Having an eating disorder boosts annual health care costs by nearly US$2,000 per person.
    Why is there both external and internal pressure to look “perfect”? One reason is that society rewards people who are thin and healthy looking. Researchers have shown that body mass index is related to wages and income. Especially for women, there is a clear penalty at work for being overweight or obese. Some studies have also found an impact for men, though a less noticeable one.
    While the research literature is clear that labor market success is partly based on how employers and customers perceive your body image, no one had explored the other side of question. Does a person's own perception of body image matter to earnings and other indicators of success in the workplace?
    Our recently published study answered this question by tracking a large national random sample of Americans over a critical time period when bodies change from teenage shape into adult form and when people build their identities.
    As in other research, women in our sample tend to over-perceive their weight—they think they're heavier than they are—while men tend to under-perceive theirs.
　　We found no relationship between the average person's self- perception of weight and labor market outcomes, although self-perceived weight can influence self-esteem（自尊心）, mental health and health behaviors.
    While the continued gender penalty in the labor market is frustrating, our finding that misperceived weight does not harm workers is more heartening. 
　　Since employers’ perception of weight is what matters in the labor market, changing discrimination laws to include body type as a category would also help. Michigan is the only state that prohibits discrimination on the basis of weight and height. We believe expanding such protections would make the labor market more fair and efficient.

46. What does the author say may have an adverse impact on people?
A) Undergoing plastic surgeries in pursuit of beauty.
B) Imitating the lifestyles of heroes and role models.
C) Striving to achieve perfection regardless of financial cost.
D) Attempting to meet society’s expectation of appearance.

47. What have researchers found out about people’s earnings?
A) They are closely related to people’s social status.
B) They have to do with people’s body weight and shape.
C) They seem to matter much less to men than to women.
D) They may not be equal to people’s contributions.

48. What does the author’s recent study focus on?
A) Previous literature on indicators of competitiveness in the workplace.
B) Traits that matter most in one’s pursuit of success in the labor market.
C) Whether self-perception of body image impacts one’s workplace success.
D) How bosses’ perception of body image impacts employees’ advancement.

49. What is the finding of the author’s recent research?
A) Being overweight actually does not do much harm to the overall well-being of employees.
B) People are not adversely affected in the workplace by false self-perception of body weight.
C) Self-esteem helps to combat gender inequality in the workplace.
D) Gender inequality continues to frustrate a lot of female employees.

50. What does the author think would help improve the condition in the labor market?
A) Banning discrimination on the basis of employees’ body image.
B) Expanding protection of women against gender discrimination.
C) Helping employees change their own perception of beauty.
D) Excluding body shape as a category in the labor contract.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　The work-life balance is dead. By this, I'm not advocating that you should give up your pursuit of having a fulfilling career and a thriving personal life, and I’m definitely not saying that you have to give up one to have the other. I also acknowledge that we have a work-life problem, but I'm arguing that the concept of balance has never been helpful, because it's too limiting. You see, our language makes a difference, and how we refer to things matters because it affects our thinking and therefore our actions. 
　　At the minimum, most of us work because we want to be able to support ourselves, our families, and the people around us. In the ideal world, we're all doing work that we're proud of and that provides meaning and purpose to us. But even if your job doesn't give you shivers of joy each new day, working is a part of what each of us does and the contribution we make to society. When you separate work and life, it’s a little bit harder to make that connection. But when you think of work as part of a full life and a complete experience, it becomes easier to see that success in one aspect often supports another.
　　Losing your balance and falling isn’t pleasant. A goal to balance suggests that things could quickly get off the balance, and that causes terrible outcomes. It’s more constructive to think of solutions that continue to evolve over shifts in life and work. Rather than falling or failing, you may have good days or better days or not-so-good days. These variations are normal, and it’s more useful to think of life as something that is ever evolving and changing, rather than a high-risk enterprise where things could go wrong with one misstep.
　　How we talk to ourselves matters, and how we talk about issues makes a difference. Let’s bury “work-life balance” and think bigger and better about work-life fulfillment to do a little less balancing and a lot more living.

Why Are Asian Americans Missing From Our Textbooks?
[A] I still remember my fourth-grade social studies project. Our class was studying the Gold Rush, something all California fourth-graders learned. I was excited because I had asked to research Chinese immigrants during that era. Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, I had always known that “San Francisco” translated to “Gold Mountain” in Chinese. The name had stuck ever since Chinese immigrants arrived on the shores of Northern California in the 1850s, eager to try their luck in the gold mines. Now I’d have the chance to learn about them.

[B] My excitement was short-lived. I remember heading to the library with my class and asking for help. I remember the librarian’s hesitation. She finally led me past row after row of books, to a corner of the library where she pulled an oversized book off the shelf. She checked the index and turned over to a page about early Chinese immigrants in California. That was all there was in my entire school library in San Francisco, home of the nation’s first Chinatown. That was it.

[C] I finally had the opportunity to learn about Asian Americans like myself, and how we became part of the fabric of the United States when I took an introductory class on Asian-American history in college. The class was a revelation. I realized how much had been missing in my textbooks as I grew up. My identity had been shaped by years of never reading, seeing, hearing, or learning about people who had a similar background as me. Why, I wondered, weren’t the stories, histories, and contributions of Asian Americans taught in K-12 schools, especially in the elementary schools? Why are they still not taught? 

[D] Our students—Asian, Latino, African American, Native American, and, yes, white—stand to gain from a multicultural curriculum. Students of color are more engaged and earn better grades when they see themselves in their studies. Research has also found that white students benefit by being challenged and exposed to new perspectives.

[E] For decades, activists have called for schools to offer anti-racism or multicultural curricula. Yet a traditional American K-12 curriculum continues to be taught from a Eurocentric point of view. Being multicultural often falls back on weaving children of color into photographs, or creating a few supporting characters that happen to be ethnic—an improvement, but superficial nonetheless. Elementary school classrooms celebrate cultural holidays—Lunar New Year! Red envelopes! Lion dancers!—but they’re quick to gloss over(掩饰)the challenges and injustices that Asian Americans have faced. Most students don’t, for example, learn about the laws that for years excluded Asians from immigrating to the U.S. They don't hear the narratives of how and why Southeast Asian refugees(难民) had to rebuild their lives here.

[F] Research into what students learn in school has found just how much is missing in their studies. In an analysis, Christine Sleeter, a professor in the College of Professional Studies at California State University, Monterey Bay, reviewed California’s history and social studies framework, the curriculum determined by state educators that influences what is taught in K-12 classrooms. Of the nearly 100 Americans recommended to be studied, 77% were white, 18% were African American, 4% were Native American, and 1% were Latino. None were Asian American.

[G] Worse, when Asian Americans do make an appearance in lesson books, it is often laced with problems. “There hasn’t been much progress,” says Nicholas Hartlep, an assistant professor at Metropolitan State University. His 2016 study of K-12 social studies textbooks and teacher manuals found that Asian Americans were poorly represented at best, and subjected to racist caricatures（拙劣的模仿）at worst. The wide diversity of Asian Americans was overlooked; there was very little mention of South Asians or Pacific Islanders, for example. And chances were, in the images, Asian Americans appeared in stereotypical（模式化的）roles, such as engineers.

[H] Teachers with a multicultural background or training could perhaps overcome such curriculum challenges, but they’re few and far between. In California, 65% of K-12 teachers are white, compared with a student population that is 75% students of color. Nationwide, the gap is even greater. It isn’t a requirement that teachers share the same racial or ethnic background as their students, but the imbalance poses challenges, from the potential for unconscious bias to a lack of knowledge or comfort in discussing race and culture.

[I] How race and ethnicity is taught is crucial, says Allyson Tintiangco-Cubales, an Asian-American studies professor at San Francisco State University. She added that it’s not so much about the teacher’s background, but about training. “You can have a great curriculum but if you don’t have teachers dedicated（专注于） to teaching it well,” she says, “it won’t work as well as you want it to.

[J] Some teachers are finding ways to expose students to Asian-American issues — if not during school hours, then outside of them. This summer, Wilson Wong will lead a class of rising fifth-graders at a day camp dedicated to Chinese culture and the Chinese-American community in Oakland, California. His students, for instance, will learn about how Chinese immigrants built the railroads in California, and even have a chance to “experience” it themselves: They will race each other to build a railroad model on the playground, with some students being forced to “work” longer and faster and at cheaper wages. Wong, a middle school teacher during the school year, hopes he’s exposing the students to how Chinese Americans contributed to the U.S., something that he didn’t get as a student growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area. “I planted the seeds early,” he says. “That’s what I’m hoping for.

[K] And, despite setbacks, the tide may finally be turning. California legislators passed a bill last year that will bring ethnic studies to all its public high schools. Some school districts, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, already offer ethnic studies at its high schools. High schools in Portland, Chicago, and elsewhere have either implemented or will soon introduce ethnic studies classes. And, as more high schools begin teaching it, the door could crack open for middle schools, and, perhaps inevitably, elementary schools, to incorporate a truly more multicultural curriculum. Doing so will send an important message to the nation’s youngest citizens: Whatever your race or ethnicity, you matter. Your history matters. Your story matters.

36. While cultural holidays are celebrated, the injustices experienced by Asian Americans are not exposed in elementary school classrooms.

37. Little information can be found about Chinese immigrants in the author’s school library.

38. A middle school teacher is making a great effort to help students learn about the contributions made by Chinese immigrants to America.

39. No Asian Americans were included in the list of historical figures recommended for study in K-12 classrooms.

40. There is an obvious lack of teachers with a multicultural perspective to meet the curriculum challenges in America.

41. Students of ethnic backgrounds learn better from a multicultural curriculum.

42. Now more and more high schools in America are including ethnic studies in their curriculums.

43. A study of some K-12 textbooks and teacher manuals showed that Asian Americans were inadequately and improperly represented in them.

44. When taking a class in college, the author realized that a lot of information about Asian Americans was left out of the textbooks he studied.

45. An Asian-American studies professor placed greater emphasis on teacher training than on teachers’ background.

Section C
Directions：There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D) .You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
 
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.

　　When is cleaning was a crime? When you’re doing it to create art, obviously. A number of street artists around the world have started expressing themselves through a practice known as reverse graffiti (涂鸦). They find dirty surfaces and paint them with images or messages using cleaning brushes or pressure hoses (高压水管) . Either way, it's the same principle: the image is made by cleaning away the dirt. Each artist has their own individual style but all artists share a common aim: to draw attention to the pollution in our cities. The UK’s Paul Curtis, better known as Moose, operates around Leeds and London and has been commissioned by a number of companies to make reverse graffiti advertisements.
　　Brazilian artist, Alexandre Orion, turned one of Sao Paulo's transport tunnels into an amazing wall painting in 2006 by getting rid of the dirt. Made up of a series of white skulls (颅骨), the painting reminds drivers of the effect their pollution is having on the planet. “Every motorists sits in the comfort of their car, but they don't give any consideration to the price their comfort has for the environment and consequently for themselves,” says Orion.
　　The anti-pollution message of the reverse graffiti artists confuses city authorities since the main argument against graffiti is that it spoils the appearance of both types of property: public and private. This was what Leeds City Council said about Moose's work: “Leeds residents want to live in clean and attractive neighbourhoods. We view this kind of advertising as environmental damage and will take strong action against it.” Moose was ordered to “clean up his act.” How was he supposed to do this: by making all property he had cleaned dirty again?
　　As for the Brazilian artist’s work, the authorities were annoyed but could find nothing to charge him with. They had no other option but to clean the tunnel—but only the parts Alexandre had already cleaned. The artist merely continued his campaign on the other side. The city officials then decided to take drastic action. They not only cleaned the whole tunnel but every tunnel in Sao Paulo.

46. What do we learn from the passage about reverse graffiti?
A) It uses paint to create anti-pollution images.
B) It creates a lot of trouble for local residents.
C) It causes lots of distraction to drivers.
D) It turns dirty walls into artistic works.

47. What do reverse graffiti artists try to do?
A) Publicise their artistic pursuit.
B) Beautify the city environment.
C) Raise public awareness of environmental pollution.
D) Express their dissatisfaction with local governments.

48. What do we learn about Brazilian artist Alexandre Orion?
A) He was good at painting white skulls.
B) He chose tunnels to do his graffiti art.
C) He suggested banning all polluting cars.
D) He was fond of doing creative artworks.

49. What does the author imply about Leeds City Council’s decision?
A) It is simply absurd.
B) It is well-informed.
C) It is rather unexpected.
D) It is quite sensible.

50. How did Sao Paulo city officials handle Alexandre Orion’s reverse graffiti?
A) They made him clean all the tunnels in Sao Paulo.
B) They took drastic action to ban all reverse graffiti.
C) They charged him with polluting tunnels in the city.
D) They made it impossible for him to practice his art.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　The practice of paying children an allowance became popular in America about 100 years ago. Nowadays, American kids on average receive about $800 per year in allowance. But the vast majority of American parents who pay allowance tie it to the completion of housework. Although many parents believe that paying an allowance for completing chores benefits their children, a range of experts expressed concern that tying allowance very closely to chores may not be ideal. In fact, the way chores work in many households worldwide points to another way.
　　Suniya Luthar, a psychologist, is against paying kids for chores. Luthar is not opposed to giving allowances, but she thinks it’s important to establish that chores are done not because they will lead to payment, but because they keep the household running. Luthar’s suggested approach to allowance is compatible with that of writer Ron Lieber, who advises that allowances be used as a means of showing children how to save, give, and spend on things they care about. Kids should do chores, he writes, “for the same reason adults do, because the chores need to be done, and not with the expectation of compensation.”
　　This argument has its critics, but considering the way chores are undertaken around the world may change people’s thinking. Professor David Lancy of Utah State University has studied how families around the world handle chores. At about 18 months of age, Lancy says, most children become eager to help their parents, and in many cultures, they begin helping with housework at that age. They begin with very simple tasks, but their responsibilities gradually increase. And they do these tasks without payment. Lancy contrasts this with what happens in America. “We deny our children’s bids to help until they are 6 or 7 years old,” Lancy says, “when many have lost the desire to help and then try to motivate them with payment. The solution to this problem is not to try to use money as an incentive to do housework, but to get children involved in housework much earlier, when they actually want to do it.”

51. What do some experts think about paying children for doing chores?
A) It may benefit children in more ways than one.
B) It may help children learn the worth of labor.
C) It may not turn out to be the best thing to do.
D) It may not be accepted by low-income parents.

52. According to Suniya Luthar, doing chores will help children learn to ____.
A) share family responsibilities
B) appreciate the value of work
C) cultivate the spirit of independence
D) manage domestic affairs themselves

53. What does Ron Lieber think should be the goal of giving children allowances?
A) To help to strengthen family ties.
B) To teach them how to manage money.
C) To motivate them to do more housework.
D) To show parents’ appreciation of their help.

54. What does David Lancy say about 18-month-olds?
A) They have a natural instinct to help around the house.
B) They are too young to request money for what they do.
C) They should learn to understand family responsibilities.
D) They need a little incentive to get involved in housework.

55. What does David Lancy advise American parents to do?
A) Set a good example for children in doing housework.
B) Make children do housework without compensation.
C) Teach children how to do housework.
D) Accept children’s early bids to help.

The Place Where the Poor Once Thrived 

This is the land of opportunity. If that weren’t already implied by the landscape—rolling green hills, palm trees,sun-kissed flowers—then it’s evident in the many stories of people who grew up poor in these sleepy neighborhoods and rose to enormous success. People like Tri Tran,who fled Vietnam on a boat in 1986,showed up in San Jose with nothing,made it to MIT,and then founded the food-delivery start-up Munchery, which is valued at $ 300 million.
Indeed, data suggests that this is one of the best places to grow up poor in America. A child born in the early 1980s into a low-income family in San Jose had a 12.9 percent chance of becoming a high earner as an adult,according to a landmark study released in 2014 by the economist Raj Chetty and his colleagues from Harvard and Berkeley. That number—12.9 percent—may not seem remarkable, but it was：Kids in San Jose whose families fell in the bottom quintile（五分位数）of income nationally had the best shot in the country at reaching the top quintile.
By contrast, just 4.4 percent of poor kids in Charlotte moved up to the top; in Detroit the figure was 5.5 percent.San Jose had social mobility comparable to Denmark’s and Canada's and higher than other progressive cities such as Boston and Minneapolis.
The reasons kids in San Jose performed so well might seem obvious. Some of the world’s most innovative companies are located here, providing opportunities such as the one seized by a 12-year-old Mountain View resident named Steve Jobs when he called William Hewlett to ask for spare parts and subsequently received a summer job. This is a city of immigrants—38 percent of the city's population today is foreign-born—and immigrants and their children have historically experienced significant upward mobility in America. The city has long had a large foreign-born population (26.5 percent in 1990), leading to broader diversity,,which,the Harvard and Berkeley economists say,is a good predictor of mobility.
Indeed,the streets of San Jose seem,in some ways,to embody the best of America. It's possible to drive in a matter of minutes from sleek（光亮的）office towers near the airport where people pitch ideas to investors,to single-family homes with orange trees in their yards,or to a Vietnamese mall. The libraries here offer programs in 17 languages,and there are areas filled with small businesses owned by Vietnamese immigrants,Mexican immigrants,Korean immigrants,and Filipino immigrants, to name a few.
But researchers aren’t sure exactly why poor kids in San Jose did so well. The city has a low prevalence of children growing up in single-parent families,and a low level of concentrated poverty, both factors that usually mean a city allows for good intergenerational mobility. But San Jose also performs poorly on some of the measures correlated with good mobility.It is one of the most unequal places out of the 741 that the researchers measured，and it has high degrees of racial and economic segregation（隔离）. Its schools underperform based on how much money there is in the area,said Ben Scuderi,a predoctoral fellow at the Equality of Opportunity Project at Harvard,which uses big data to study how to improve economic opportunities for low-income children. “There’s a lot going on here which we don't totally understand,” he said. “ It’s interesting, because it kind of defies our expectations.”
G)The Chetty data shows that neighborhoods and places mattered for children born in the San Jose area of the 1980s.Whether the city still allows for upward mobility of poor kids today, though, is up for debate. Some of the indicators such as income inequality,measured by the Equality of Opportunity Project for the year 2000, have only worsened in the past 16 years.
H)Some San Jose residents say that as inequality has grown in recent years,upward mobility has become much more difficult to achieve. As Silicon Valley has become home to more successful companies, the flood of people to the area has caused housing prices to skyrocket.By most measures,San Jose is no longer a place where low-income,or even middle-income families,can afford to live.Rents in San Jose grew 42.6 percent between 2006 and 2014,which was the largest increase in the country during that time period. The city has a growing homelessness problem,which it tried.to address by shutting down “The Jungle,” one of the largest homeless encampments（临时住地）in the nation, in 2014. Inequality is extreme. The Human Development Index—a measure of life expectancy,education and per capita（人均的）income—gives East San Jose a score of 4.85 out of 10，while nearby Cupertino, where Apple’s headquarters sits, receives a 9.26. San Jose used to have a happy mix of factors—cheap housing,closeness to a rapidly developing industry,tightly-knit immigrant communities—that together opened up the possibility of prosperity for even its poorest residents. But in recent years,housing prices have skyrocketed, the region's rich and poor have segregated,and middle-class jobs have disappeared. Given this, the future for the region's poor doesn't look nearly as bright as it once did.
I)Leaders in San Jose are determined to make sure that the city regains its status as a place where even poor kids can access the resources to succeed. With Silicon Valley in its backyard, it certainly has the chance to do so. “ I think there is a broad consciousness in the Valley that we can do better than to leave thousands of our neighbors behind through a period of extraordinary success,” San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said.
J) But in today’s America—a land of rising inequality，increasing segregation，and stagnating（不增长的）middle-class wages—can the San Jose region really once again become a place of opportunity?
K)The idea that those at the bottom can rise to the top is central to America's ideas about itself. That such mobility has become more difficult in San Jose raises questions about the endurance of that foundational belief. After all, if the one-time land of opportunity can't be fixed,what does that say for the rest of America?

36.According to some people living in San Jose,it has become much harder for the poor to get ahead due to the increased inequality.

37.In American history,immigrants used to have a good chance to move upward in society.
38.If the problems of San Jose can’t be solved, one of America’s fundamental beliefs about itself can be shaken.
39.San Jose was among the best cities in America for poor kids to move up the social ladder.
40.Whether poor kids in San Jose today still have the chance to move upward is questionable. 
41.San Jose’s officials are resolved to give poor kids access to the resources necessary for success in life. 
42.San Jose appears to manifest some of the best features of America.
43.As far as social mobility is concerned,San Jose beat many other progressive cities in America. 
44.Due to some changes like increases in housing prices in San Jose, the prospects for its poor people have dimmed.
45.Researchers do not have a clear idea why poor children in San Jose achieved such great success several decades ago. 
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Three children in every classroom have a diagnosable mental health condition. Half of these are behavioural disorders,while one third are emotional disorders such as stress,anxiety and depression, which often become outwardly apparent through self-harm. There was an astonishing 52 per cent jump in hospital admissions for children and young people who had harmed themselves between 2009 and 2015.
　　　Schools and teachers have consistently reported the scale of the problem since 2009.Last year, over half of teachers reported that more of their pupils experience mental health problems than in the past. But teachers also consistently report how ill-equipped they feel to meet pupils’ mental health needs,and often cite a lack of training，expertise and support from the National Health Service（英国国家医疗服务体系）.
　　　Part of the reason for the increased pressure on.schools is that there are now fewer ‘early intervention （干预）’and low-level mental health services based in the community. Cuts to local authority budgets since 2010 have resulted in a significant decline of these services, despite strong evidence of their effectiveness in preventing crises further down the line.
　　　The only way to break the pressures on both mental health services and schools is to reinvest in early intervention services inside schools.
　　　There are strong arguments for why schools are best placed to provide mental health services. Schools see young people more than any other service,which gives them a unique ability to get to hard-to-reach children and young people and build meaningful relationships with them over time. Recent studies have shown that children and young people largely prefer to see a counsellor in school rather than in an.outside environment. Young people have reported that for low-level conditions such as stress and anxiety,a clinical setting can sometimes be daunting（令人却步的）.
　　　There are already examples of innovative schools which combine mental health and wellbeing provision with a strong academic curriculum. This will,though,require a huge cultural shift. Politicians, policymakers,commissioners and school leaders must be brave enough to make the leap towards reimagining schools as providers of health as well as education services. 
　　　
46.What are teachers complaining about?
A)There are too many students requiring special attention. 
B)They are under too much stress counselling needy students.
C)Schools are inadequately equipped to implement any intervention.
D)They lack the necessary resources to address pupils’ mental problems.

47.What do we learn from the passage about community health services in Britain?
A)) They have deteriorated due to budget cuts. 
B)They facilitate local residents’ everyday lives. 
C)They prove ineffective in helping mental patients. 
D)They cover preventative care for the local resident.

48.Where does the author suggest mental health services be placed?
A)At home.   B)At school.   C) In hospitals.    D) In communities.    
    
49. What do we learn from the recent studies?
A) Students prefer to rely on peers to relieve stress and anxiety. 
B) Young people are keen on building meaningful relationships. 
C) Students are more comfortable seeking counselling in school. 
D) Young people benefit from various kinds of outdoor activities. 

50. What does the author mean by a cultural shift (Line 2, Para. 6)?
A) Simplification of schools’ academic curriculums. 
B) Parents’ involvement in schools’ policy-making. 
C) A change in teachers’ attitudes to mental health. 
D)A change in the conception of what schools are. 

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　　Picture this: You’re at a movie theater food stand loading up on snacks. You have a choice of a small, medium or large soda. The small is $3.50 and the large is $5.50. It’s a tough decision: The small size may not last you through the whole movie,but $5.50 for some sugary drink seems ridiculous. But there’s a third option,a medium soda for $5.25. Medium may be the perfect amount of soda for you, but the large is only a quarter more.If you’re like most people, you end up buying the large(and taking a bathroom break midshow).
　　　If you’re wondering who would buy the medium soda, the answer is almost.no one.In fact, there’s a good chance the marketing department purposely priced the medium soda as a decoy（诱饵），making you more likely to buy the large soda rather than the small. 
　　　I have written about this peculiarity in human nature before with my friend Dan Ariely, who studied this phenomenon extensively after noticing pricing for subscriptions（订阅）to The Economist. The digital subscription was $59, the print subscription was $125, and the print plus digital subscription was also $125. No one in their right mind would buy the print subscription when you could get digital as well for the same price,so why was it even an option? Ariely ran an experiment and found that when only the two"real"choices were offered,more people chose the less-expensive digital subscription. But the addition of the bad option made people much more likely to choose the more expensive print plus digital option.
　　　Brain scientists call this effect “asymmetric dominance” and it means that people gravitate toward the choice nearest a clearly inferior option. Marketing professors call it the decoy effect,which is certainly easier to remember. Lucky for consumers,almost no one in the business community understands it.
　　　The decoy effect works because of the way our brains.assign value when making choices. Value is almost never absolute; rather,we decide an object's value relative to our other choices. If more options are introduced, the value equation changes.
　　　
51.Why does the author ask us to imagine buying food in the movie theater?
A)To illustrate people's peculiar shopping behavior. 
B)To illustrate the increasing variety of snacks there.
C)To show how hard it can be to choose a drink there.
D)To show how popular snacks are among movie fans.

52.Why is the medium soda priced the way it is? 
A)To attract more customers to buy it. 
B)To show the price matches the amount.
C)To ensure customers drink the right amount of soda.
D)To make customers believe they are getting a bargain. 

53.What do we learn from Dan Ariely’s experiment?
A)Lower-priced goods attract more customers. 
B)The Economist’s promotional strategy works.
C)The Economist’s print edition turns out to sell the best. 
D)More readers choose the digital over the print edition.

54.For what purpose is “the bad option” (Line 7, Para.3)added?
A)To cater to the peculiar needs of some customers. 
B)To help customers to make more rational choices.
C)To trap customers into buying the more pricey item. 
D)To provide customers with a greater variety of goods.

55.How do we assess the value of a commodity, acording to the passage?  淘宝店铺：光速考研工作室
A) By considering its usefulness. 
B) By comparing it with other choices.
C) By taking its quality into account.  
D) By examining its value equation.

　　　When my son completes a task, I can’t help but praise him. It’s only natural to give praise where praise is due, right? But is there such a thing as too much praise?
　　　According to psychologist Katherine Phillip, children don’t benefit from   26   praise as much as we’d like to think. “Parents often praise, believing they are building their child’s self-confidence. However, over-praising can have a   27   effect,” says Phillip. “When we use the same praise   28  , it may become empty and no longer valued by the child. It can also become an expectation that anything they do must be   29   with praise. This may lead to the child avoiding taking risks due to fear of   30   their parents.”
　　　Does this mean we should do away with all the praise?Phillip says no.“The key to healthy praise is to focus on the process rather than the   31  . It is the recognition of a child’s attempt, or the process in which they achieved something, that is essential,”she says. “Parents should encourage their child to take the risks needed to learn and grow.”
　　　So how do we break the   32   of praise we’re all so accustomed to? Phillip says it’s important         to   33   between “person praise” and “process praise”. “Person praise is   34   saying how great someone is. Its a form of personal approval. Process praise is acknowledgement of the efforts the person has just   35  . Children who receive person praise are more likely to feel shame after losing,” says Phillip.
　　
A) choose	I) pattern
B) constant	J)plural
C) disappointing	K) repeatedly
D) distinguish	L) rewarded
E) exhausting	M) separately
F) experienced	N) simply
G) negative	O) undertaken
H) outcome

Answer the questions by making the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Poverty Is a Story About Us, Not Them

A) Too often still, we think we know what poverty looks like. It’s the way we’ve been taught, the images we’ve been force-fed for decades. The chronically homeless. The undocumented immigrant. The urban poor, usually personified as a woman of color, the“ welfare queen” politicians still too often reference.

B)But as income inequality rises to record levels in the United States, even in the midst of a record economic expansion, those familiar images are outdated,hurtful, and counterproductive to focusing attention on solutions and building ladders of opportunity.

C) Today’s faces of income inequality and lack of opportunity look like all of us. Its Anna Landre, a disabled Georgetown University student fighting to keep health benefits that allow her the freedom to live her life.It’s Tiffanie Standard, a counselor for young women of color in Philadelphia who want to be tech entrepreneurs—but who must work multiple jobs to stay afloat. It’s Ken Outlaw, a welder in rural North Carolina whose dream of going back to school at a local community college was dashed by Hurricane Florence—just one of the extreme weather events that have tipped the balance for struggling Americans across the nation.

D) If these are the central characters of our story about poverty, what layers of perceptions, myths,and realities must we unearth to find meaningful solutions and support? In pursuit of revealing this complicated reality, Mothering Justice, led by women of color, went last year to the state capital in Lansing, Michigan, to lobby on issues that affect working mothers.One of the Mothering Justice organizers went to the office of a state representative to talk about the lack of affordable childcare—the vestiges(痕迹) of a system that expected mothers to stay home with their children while their husbands worked. A legislative staffer dismissed the activists concerns, telling her“my husband took care of that—l stayed home.”

E) That comment, says Mothering Justice director Danielle Atkinson,“was meant to shame” and relied on the familiar notion that a woman of color concerned about income inequality and programs that promote mobility must by definition be a single mom, probably with multiple kids. In this case,the Mothering Justice activist happened to be married. And in most cases in the America of 2019, the images that come to mind when we hear the words poverty or income inequality fail miserably in reflecting a complicated reality: poverty touches virtually all of us. The face of income inequality, for all but a very few of us, is the one we each see in the mirror.

F) How many of us are poor in the U.S.? It depends on who you ask. According to the Census Bureau, 38 million people in the U.S. are living below the official poverty thresholds. Taking into account economic need beyond that absolute measure,the Institute for Policy Studies found that140 million people are poor or low-income. That’s almost half the U.S. population.

G) Whatever the measure,within that massive group, poverty is extremely diverse. We know that some people are more affected than others, like children, the elderly, people with disabilities, and people of color.
H) But the fact that 4 in 10 Americans can’t come up with $ 400 in an emergency is a commonly cited statistic for good reason: economic instability stretches across race, gender,and geography. It even reaches into the middle classes, as real wages have stagnated (不增长)for all but the very wealthy and temporary spells of financial instability are not uncommon.

I) Negative images remain of who is living in poverty as well as what is needed to move out of it. The big American myth is that you can pull yourself up by your own efforts and change a bad situation into a good one.The reality is that finding opportunity without help from families, friends, schools, and community is virtually impossible. And the playing field is nothing close to level.

J) The FrameWorks Institute, a research group that focuses on public framing of issues, has studied what sustains stereotypes and narratives of poverty in the United Kingdom.“People view economic success and wellbeing in life as a product of choice,willpower，and drive,”says Nat Kendall-Taylor, CEO of FrameWorks. “When we see people who are struggling,” he says, those assumptions “lead us to the perception that people in poverty are lazy, they don’t care, and they haven’t made the right decisions.”

K) Does this sound familiar?Similar ideas surround poverty in the U.S. And these assumptions give a false picture of reality. “When people enter into that pattfern of thinking,”says Kendall-Taylor, “it’s cognitively comfortable to make sense of issues of poverty in that way. It creates a kind of cognitive blindness—all of the factors external to a person’s drive and choices that they’ve made become invisible and fade from view.”

L) Those external factors include the difficulties accompanying low-wage work or structural discrimination based on race,gender, or ability.Assumptions get worse when people who are poor use government benefits to help them survive. There is a great tension between “the poor” and those who are receiving what has become a dirty word: “welfare.”

M) According to the General Social Survey,71 percent of respondents believe the country is spending too little on “assistance to the poor”.On the other hand, 22 percent think we are spending too little on “welfare” : 37 percent believe we are spending too much.
N)“Poverty has been interchangeable with people of color—specifically black women and black mothers,”says Atkinson of Mothering Justice. It’s true that black mothers are more affected by poverty than many other groups, yet they are disproportionately the face of poverty.For example, Americans routinely overestimate the share of black recipients of public assistance programs.

O) In reality, most people will experience some form of financial hardship at some point in their lives. Indeed, people tend to dip in and out of poverty, perhaps due to unexpected obstacles like losing a job, or when hours of a low-wage job fluctuate.

P) Something each of us can do is to treat each other with the dignity and sympathy that is deserved and to understand deeply that the issue of poverty touches all of us.

36.One legislative staffer assumed that a woman of color who advocated affordable childcare must be a single mother.

37.People from different races, genders and regions all suffer from a lack of financial security.

38.According to a survey, while the majority believe too little assistance is given to the poor, more than a third believe too much is spent on welfare.,

39.A research group has found that Americans who are struggling are thought to be lazy and to have made the wrong decisions.

40.Under the old system in America, a mother was supposed to stay home and take care of her children.

41. It was found that nearly 50% of Americans are poor or receive low pay.

42.Americans usually overestimate the number of blacks receiving welfare benefits.

43. It is impossible for Americans to lift themselves out of poverty entirely on their own.

44.Nowadays, it seems none of us can get away from income inequality.

45.Assumptions about poor people become even more negative when they live on welfare.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　
　　　Boredom has, paradoxically, become quite interesting to academics lately. In early May, London’s Boring Conference celebrated seven years of delighting in dullness. At this event, people flocked to talks about weather , traffic jams and vending-machine sounds, among other sleep-inducing topics.
　　　What, exactly, is everybody studying? One widely accepted psychological definition of boredom is“the distasteful experience of wanting, but being unable, to engage in satisfying activity.” But how can you quantify a person’s boredom level and compare it with someone else’s? In 1986,psychologists introduced the Boredom Proneness Scale,designed to measure an individual’s overall tendency to feel bored.By contrast,the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale, developed in 2008, measures a person’s feelings of boredom in a given situation.
　　　Boredom has been linked to behavior issues including inattentive driving, mindless snacking, excessive drinking, and addictive gambling. In fact,many of us would choose pain over boredom. One team of psychologists discovered that two-thirds of men and a quarter of women would rather self-administer electric shocks than sit alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes. Researching this phenomenon, another team asked volunteers to watch boring, sad, or neutral films, during which they could self-administer electric shocks. The bored volunteers shocked themselves more and harder than the sad or neutral ones did.
　　　But boredom isn’t all bad. By encouraging self-reflection and daydreaming, it can spur creativity. An early study gave participants abundant time to complete problem-solving and word-association exercises. Once all the obvious answers were exhausted, participants gave more and more inventive answers to combat boredom.A British study took these findings one step further, asking subjects to complete a creative challenge (coming up with a list of alternative uses for a household item). One group of subjects did a boring activity first,while the others went straight to the creative task. Those whose boredom pumps had been primed were more productive.
　　　In our always-connected world, boredom may be a hard-to-define state, but it is a fertile one.Watch paint dry or water boil, or at least put away your smartphone for a while, and you might unlock your next big idea.
　　　
46. When are people likely to experience boredom, according to an accepted psychological definition?
A) When they don’t have the chance to do what they want.
B) When they don’t enjoy the materials they are studying.C)When they experience something unpleasant.
D) When they engage in some routine activities.

47. What does the author say boredom can lead to?
A) Determination.
C)Mental deterioration.
B) Concentration.
D) Harmful conduct.

48. What is the finding of one team of psychologists in their experiment?
A) Volunteers prefer watching a boring movie to sitting alone deliberating.
B) Many volunteers choose to hurt themselves rather than endure boredom.
C)Male volunteers are more immune to the effects of boredom than females.
D) Many volunteers are unable to resist boredom longer than fifteen minutes.

49. Why does the author say boredom isn’t all bad?
A ) It stimulates memorization.
C) It may promote creative thinking.
B) It allows time for relaxation.
D) It may facilitate independent learning.

50. What does the author suggest one do when faced with a challenging problem?
A) Stop idling and think big.
C) Look around oneself for stimulation.
B)Unlock one’s smartphone.
D)Allow oneself some time to be bored.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.

　　　Forests in countries like Brazil and the Congo get a lot of attention from environmentalists,and it is easy to see why. South America and sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing deforestation on an enormous scale: every year almost 5 million hectares are lost. But forests are also changing in rich Western countries. They are growing larger, both in the sense that they occupy more land and that the trees in them are bigger. What is going on?
　　　Forests are spreading in almost all Western countries,with the fastest growth in places that historically had rather few trees. In 1990 28% of Spain was forested;now the proportion is 37%. In both Greece and Italy, the growth was from 26% to 32% over the same period.Forests are gradually taking more land in America and Australia.Perhaps most astonishing is the trend in Ireland. Roughly 1% of that country was forested when it became independent in 1922. Now forests cover 11% of the land,and the government wants to push the proportion to 18% by the 2040s.
　　　Two things are fertilising this growth. The first is the abandonment of farmland, especially in high, dry places where nothing grows terribly well. When farmers give up trying to earn a living from farming or herding,trees simply move in. The second is government policy and subsidy. Throughout history, governments have protected and promoted forests for diverse reasons,ranging from the need for wooden warships to a desire to promote suburban house-building. Nowadays forests are increasingly welcome because they suck in carbon pollution from the air. The justifications change, the desire for more trees remains constant.
　　　The greening of the West does not delight everyone.Farmers complain that land is being taken out of use by generously subsidised tree plantations.Parts of Spain and Portugal suffer from terrible forest fires. Others simply dislike the appearance of forests planted in neat rows.They will have to get used to the trees, however. The growth of Western forests seems almost as unstoppable as deforestation elsewhere.
　　　
51. What is catching environmentalists’ attention nowadays?
A) Rich countries are stripping poor ones of their resources.
B)Forests are fast shrinking in many developing countries.
C)Forests are eating away the fertile farmland worldwide.
D)Rich countries are doing little to address deforestation.

52.Which countries have the fastest forest growth?
A) Those that have newly achieved independence.
B) Those that have the greatest demand for timber.
C) Those that used to have the lowest forest coverage.
D) Those that provide enormous government subsidies.

53. What has encouraged forest growth historically?
A) The government’s advocacy.						C) The favourable climate.
B) The use of wood for fuel.						D) The green movement.

54. What accounts for our increasing desire for forests?
A) Their unique scenic beauty.						C) Their capability of improving air quality.
B) Their use as fruit plantations.					D) Their stable supply of building materials.

55. What does the author conclude about the prospects of forestation?
A) Deserts in sub-Saharan Africa will diminish gradually.
B) It will play a more and more important role in people’s lives.
C) Forest destruction in the developing world will quickly slow down.
D) Developed and developing countries are moving in opposite directions.

　　　The things people make,and the way they make them, determine how cities grow and decline,and influence how empires rise and fall. So, any disruption to the world’s factories   26  .And that disruption is surely coming. Factories are being digitised, filled with new sensors and new computers to make them quicker, more   27  , and more efficient.
　　　Robots are breaking free from the cages that surround them, learning new skills and new ways of working.And 3D printers have long   28   a world where you can make anything, anywhere, from a computerised design. That vision is _ 29 _ closer to reality. These forces will lead to cleaner factories, producing better goods at lower prices, personalised to our individual needs and desires. Humans will  be   30   many of the dirty，repetitive,and dangerous jobs that have long been a   31   of factory life.
　　　Greater efficiency   32   means fewer people can do the same work. Yet factory bosses in many developed countries are worried about a lack of skilled human workers—and see   33   and robots as a solution. But economist Helena Leurent says this period of rapid change in manufacturing is a   34  opportunity to make the world a better place. “ Manufacturing is the one system where you have got the biggest source of innovation, the biggest source of economic growth, and the biggest source of great jobs in the past. You can see it changing.That’s an opportunity to   35   that system differently, and if we can, it will have tremendous significance.”

The History of the Lunch Box

A) It was made of shiny, bright pink plastic with a Little Mermaid sticker on the front, and I carried it with me nearly every single day. My lunch box was one of my first prized possessions, a proud statement to everyone in my kindergarten:“l love Mermaid-Ariel on my lunch box.”

B) That bulky container served me well through my first and second grades, until the live-action version of 101 Dalmatians hit theaters, and I needed the newest red plastic box with characters like Pongo and Perdita on the front. I know I’m not alone here—I bet you loved your first lunchbox, too.
C) Lunch boxes have been connecting kids to cartoons and TV shows and super-heroes for decades. But it wasn’t always that way.Once upon a time,they weren’t even boxes. As schools have changed in the past century, the midday meal container has evolved right along with them.

D) Let’s start back at the beginning of the 20th century—the beginning of the lunch box story, really. While there were neighborhood schools in cities and suburbs，one-room schoolhouses were common in rural areas. As grandparents have been saying for generations, kids would travel miles to school in the countryside (often on foot).

E) “You had kids in rural areas who couldn’t go home from school for lunch, so bringing your lunch wrapped in a cloth, in oiled paper,in a little wooden box or something like that was a very long-standing rural tradition,” says Paula Johnson, head of food history section at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.

F) City kids, on the other hand, went home for lunch and came back.Since they rarely carried a meal, the few metal lunch buckets on the market were mainly for tradesmen and factory workers.

G) After World War ll, a bunch of changes reshaped schools—and lunches.More women joined the workforce. Small schools consolidated into larger ones, meaning more students were farther away from home.And the National School Lunch Act in 1946 made cafeterias much more common. Still, there wasn’t much of a market for lunch containers—yet.Students who carried their lunch often did so in a re-purposed bucket or tin of some kind.

H) And then everything changed in the year of 1950.You might as well call it the Year of the Lunch Box, thanks in large part to a genius move by a Nashville-based manufacturer，Aladdin Industries.The company already made square metal meal containers, the kind workers carried, and some had started to show up in the hands of school kids.

I) But these containers were really durable, lasting years on end. That was great for the consumer, not so much for the manufacturer. So executives at Aladdin hit on an idea that would harness the newfound popularity of television. They covered lunch boxes with striking red paint and added a picture of TV and radio cowboy Hopalong Cassidy on the front.

J) The company sold 600,000 units the first year. It was a major “Ah-ha!” moment, and a wave of other manufacturers jumped on board to capitalize on new TV shows and movies. “The Partridge Family, the Addams Family, the Six Million Dollar Man, the Bionic Woman—everything that was on television ended up on a lunch box,”says Allen Woodall.He’s the founder of the Lunch Box Museum in Columbus, Georgia.“It was a great marketing tool because kids were taking that TV show to school with them, and then when they got home they had them captured back on TV,” he says.

K) And yes, you read that right: There is a lunch box museum, right near the Chattahoochee River. Woodall has more than 2,000 items on display. His favorite? The Green Hornet lunch box, because he used to listen to the radio show back in the 1940s.

L) The new trend was also a great example of planned obsolescence, that is, to design a product so that it will soon become unfashionable or impossible to use and will need replacing. Kids would beg for a new lunch box every year to keep up with the newest characters, even if their old lunchbox was perfectly usable.

M) The metal lunch box craze lasted until the mid-1980s,when plastic took over. Two theories exist as to why. The first—and most likely—is that plastic had simply become cheaper. The second theory—possibly an urban myth—is that concerned parents in several states proposed bans on metal lunch boxes,claiming kids were using them as “weapons” to hit one another. There’s a lot on the internet about a state-wide ban in Florida, but a few days worth of digging by a historian at the Florida State Historical Society found no such legislation. Either way,the metal lunch box was out.

N) The last few decades have brought a new lunch box revolution, of sorts. Plastic boxes changed to lined cloth sacks, and eventually,globalism brought tiffin containers from India and bento boxes from Japan. Even the old metal lunch boxes have regained popularity. “I don’t think the heyday(鼎盛时期) has passed,” says D.J.Jayasekara, owner and founder of lunchbox.com, a retailer in Pasadena, California. “I think it has evolved. The days of the ready-made, ‘you stick it in a lunchbox and carry it to school’ are kind of done.”

O) The introduction of backpacks changed the lunch box scene a bit, he adds. Once kids started carrying book bags，that bulky traditional lunch box was hard to fit inside.“But you can’t just throw a sandwich in a backpack ,” Jayasekara says. “It still has to go into a container.”That is, in part,why smaller and softer containers have taken off—they fit into backpacks.

P) And don’t worry—whether it’s a plastic bento box or a cloth bag, lunch containers can still easily be covered with popular culture.“We keep pace with the movie industries so we can predict which characters are going to be popular for the coming months,”Jayasekara says. “ You know, kids are kids.”

36. Lunch containers were not necessary for school kids in cities.

37.Putting TV characters on lunch boxes proved an effective marketing strategy.

38.Smaller lunch boxes are preferred because they fit easily into backpacks.

39.Lunch boxes have evolved along with the transformation of schools.

40.Around the beginning of the nineteen fifties, some school kids started to use metal meal containers.

41 . School kids are eager to get a new lunch box every year to stay in fashion.

42.Rural kids used to walk a long way to school in the old days.

43.The author was proud of using a lunch box in her childhood.

44.The most probable reason for the popularity of plastic lunch boxes is that they are less expensive.

45.The durability of metal meal containers benefited consumers.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D).You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　
　　　A growing number of U.S. bike riders are attracted to electric bikes for convenience, health benefits and their fun factor. Although ebikes first appeared in the 90s, cheaper options and longer-lasting batteries are breathing new life into the concept.
　　　Established bike companies and startups are embracing ebikes to meet demand. About 34 million ebikes were sold worldwide last year, according to data from eCycleElectric Consultants. Most were sold in Europe and China,where the bikes already have exploded in popularity.Recently, the U.s. market has grown to 263,000 bikes, a 25% gain from the prior year.
　　　The industry is benefiting from improved batteries as suppliers over the years developed technology for laptops, smartphones and electric cars. In 2004, the price of batteries used on ebikes fell, spurring European sales.
　　　But lower cost options are emerging, too. This month, three U.S. bikeshare companies, Motivate, LimeBike and Spin, announced electric bicycles will be added to their fleets. New York-based Jump Bikes is already operating an electric bikeshare in Washington，D.C.， and is launching in San Francisco Thursday. Rides cost $ 2 for 30 minutes.
　　　The system works like existing dockless bikeshare systems,where riders unlock bikes through a smartphone app.“This is the beginning of a long-term shift away from regular pedal(踏板) to electric bikes,”said Jump Bikes CEO Ryan Rzepecki. “When people first jump on an ebike, their face lights up. It’s exciting and joyful in a way that you don’t get from a regular bike.”
　　　Two years ago, CEO Chris Cocalis of Pivot Cycles,which sells high-end mountain bikes,found that U.S. bike shops weren’t interested in stocking ebikes. Some retailers warned Cocalis that they’d drop the brand if it came out with an electric bike.
　　　Now that sales are taking off,the vast majority of bike dealers are asking Cocalis when he’ll make an ebike available. “There’s tremendous opportunity to get a generation of people for whom suffering isn’t their thing,” Cocalis said. “Ebike riders get the enjoyable part of cycling without themassive suffering of climbing huge hills.”

46. What do we learn from the passage about ebikes?
A) Their health benefits and fun values outweigh their cost.
B) They did not catch public attention in the United States until the 1990s.
C) They did not become popular until the emergence of improved batteries.
D) Their widespread use is attributable to people’s environmental awareness.

47. What brought about the boost in ebike sales in Europe at the beginning of the century?
A) Updated technology of bike manufacture.
B) The falling prices of ebike batteries.
C) Changed fashion in short-distance travel.
D) The rising costs for making electric cars.

48. What is the prospect of the bike industry according to Ryan Rzepecki?
A) More will be invested in bike battery research.
B) The sales of ebikes will increase.
C) It will profit from ebike sharing.
D) It will make a difference in people’s daily lives.

49. What prevented Chris Cocalis from developing ebikes sooner?
A) Retailers’ refusal to deal in ebikes.
B) High profits from conventional bikes.
C) Users’concern about risks of ebike riding.
D) His focus on selling costly mountain bikes.

50. What makes Chris Cocalis believe there is a greater opportunity for ebike sales?
A) The further lowering of ebike prices.
B) The public’s concern for their health.
C) The increasing interest in mountain climbing.
D) The younger generation’s pursuit of comfortable riding.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　The terms “global warming” and “climate change” are used by many, seemingly interchangeably. But do they really mean the same thing?
　　　Scientists shaped the history of the terms while attempting to accurately describe how humans continue to alter the planet. Later, political strategists adopted the terms to influence public opinion.
　　　In 1975，geochemist Wallace Broecker introduced the term “climate change” in an article published by Science. In 1979, a National Academy of Sciences report used the term “global warming” to define increases in the Earth’s average surface temperature, while “climate change” more broadly referred to the numerous effects of this increase，such as sea-level rise and ocean acidification(酸化).
　　　During the following decades,some industrialists and politicians launched a campaign to sow doubt in the minds of the American public about the ability of fossil-fuel use, deforestation and other human activities to influence the planet’s climate.
　　　Word use played a critical role in developing that doubt. For example,the language and polls expert Frank Luntz wrote a memo encouraging the use of “climate change” because the phrase sounded less scary than “global warming,” reported the Guardian.
　　　However, Luntz’s recommendation wasn’t necessary.A Google Ngram Viewer chart shows that by 1993 climate change was already more commonly used in books than global warming. By the end of the next decade both words were used more frequently, and climate change was used nearly twice as often as global warming.
　　　NASA used the term “climate change” because it more accurately reflects the wide range of changes to the planet caused by increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
　　　The debate isn’t new. A century ago, chemist Svante Arrhenius started one of the first debates over the potential for humans to influence the planet’s climate. Arrhenius calculated the capability of carbon dioxide to trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, but other chemists disagreed. Some argued that humans werent producing enough greenhouse gases,while others claimed the effects would be tiny. Now, of course, we know that whatever you call it, human behavior is warming the planet, with grave consequences ahead.
　　　

51. Why did politicians use the two terms “global warming” and “climate change”?
A) To sway public opinion of the impact of human activities on Earth.
B) To more accurately describe the consequences of human activities.
C)To win more popular votes in their campaign activities.
D) To assure the public of the safety of existing industries.

52.As used in a National Academy of Sciences report, the term “climate change” differs from “global warming” in that     .
A) it sounds less vague
B) it looks more scientific
C) it covers more phenomena
D) it is much closer to reality

53. What did industrialists of the late 20th century resort to in order to mislead Americans?
A)Made-up survey results.
C) False research findings.
B) Hired climate experts.
D) Deliberate choice of words.

54. Why did NASA choose the term “climate change”?
A) To obtain more funds.
B) For greater precision.
C) For political needs.
D) To avoid debate.

55. What is the author’s final conclusion?
A) Global warming is the more accurate term.
B) Accuracy of terminology matters in science.
C)Human activities have serious effects on Earth.
D) Politics interferes with serious scientific debate.

　　　Most animals seek shade when temperatures in the Sahara Desert soar to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. But for the Saharan silver ant,   26  from their underground nests into the sun’s brutal rays to   27   for food, this is the perfect time to seek lunch. In 2015 these ants were joined in the desert by scientists from two Belgian universities, who spent a month in the   		28	   heat tracking the ants and digging out their nests. The goal was simple, to discover how the  	 29   adapted to the kind of heat that can   30	   melt the bottom of shoes.
　　　Back in Belgium, the scientists looked at the ants under an electronic microscope and found that their   31   , triangular hair reflects light like a prism(棱镜), giving them a metallic reflection and protecting them from the sun’s awful heat. When Ph.D. student Quentin Willot 	  32		     the hair from an ant with a    33   knife and put it under a heat lamp, its temperature jumped.
　　　The ants’ method of staying cool is   34   among animals. Could this reflective type of hair protect people? Willot says companies are interested in  		35  these ants’ method of heat protection for human use, including everything from helping to protect the lives of firefighters to keeping homes cool in summer.

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
The start of high school doesn’t have to be stressful
A) This month, more than 4 million students across the nation will begin high school. Many will do well. But many will not. Consider that nearly two-thirds of students will experience the “ninth-grade shock,” which refers to a dramatic drop in a student’s academic performance. Some students cope with this shock by avoiding challenges. For instance, they may drop difficult coursework. Others may experience a hopelessness that results in failing their core classes, such as English, science and math.
B) This should matter a great deal to parents, teachers and policymakers.Ultimately it should matter to the students themselves and society at large,because students’ experience of transitioning(过渡) to the ninth grade can have long-term consequences not only for the students themselves but for their home communities. We make these observations as research psychologists who have studied how schools and families can help young people thrive.
C) In the new global economy, students who fail to finish the ninth grade with passing grades in college preparatory coursework are very unlikely to graduate on time and go on to get jobs. One study has calculated that the lifetime benefit to the local economy for a single additional student who completes high school is half a million dollars or more. This is based on higher earnings and avoided costs in health care, crime, welfare dependence and other things.
D) The consequences of doing poorly in the ninth grade can impact more than students’ ability to find a good job. It can also impact the extent to which they enjoy life. Students lose many of the friends they turned to for support when they move from the eighth to the ninth grade. One study of ninth-grade students found that 50 percent of friendships among ninth graders changed from one month to the next, signaling striking instability in friendships.
E) In addition,studies find the first year of high school typically shows one of the greatest increases in depression of any year over the lifespan.Researchers think that one explanation is that ties to friends are broken while academic demands are rising. Furthermore,most adult cases of clinical depression first emerge in adolescence (青春期). The World Health Organization reports that depression has the greatest burden of disease worldwide, in terms of the total cost of treatment and the loss of productivity.
F) Given all that’s riding on having a successful ninth grade experience, it pays to explore what can be done to meet the academic, social and emotional challenges of the transition to high school. So far, our studies have yielded one main insight: Students’ beliefs about change—their beliefs about whether people are stuck one way forever, or whether people can change their personalities and abilities—are related to their ability to cope, succeed academically and maintain good mental health. Past research has called these beliefs “mindsets (思维模式),” with a “fixed mindset” referring to the belief that people cannot change and a “growth mindset” referring to the belief that people can change.
G) In one recent study, we examined 360 adolescents’ beliefs about the nature of “smartness”—that is, their fixed mindsets about intelligence. We then assessed biological stress responses for students whose grades were dropping by examining their stress hormones(荷尔蒙). Students who believed that intelligence is fixed—that you are stuck being “not smart” if you struggle in school—showed higher levels of stress hormones when their grades were declining at the beginning of the ninth grade. If students believed that intelligence could improve—that is to say, when they held more of a growth mindset of intelligence—they showed lower levels of stress hormones when their grades were declining. This was an exciting result because it showed that the body’s stress responses are not determined solely by one’s grades. Instead, declining grades only predicted worse stress hormones among students who believed that worsening grades were a permanent and hopeless state of affairs.
H) We also investigated the social side of the high school transition. In this study, instead of teaching students that their smartness can change, we taught them that their social standing—that is, whether they are bullied or excluded or left out—can change over time. We then looked at high school students’ stress responses to daily social difficulties. That is, we taught them a growth mindset about their social lives. In this study, students came into the laboratory and were asked to give a public speech in front of upper-year students.The topic of the speech was what makes one popular in high school. Following this, students had to complete a difficult mental math task in front of the same upper-year students.
I) Experiment results showed that students who were not taught that people can change showed poor stress responses.When these students gave the speech, their blood vessels contracted and their hearts pumped less blood through the body—both responses that the body shows when it is preparing for damage or defeat after a physical threat. Then they gave worse speeches and made more mistakes in math. But when students were taught that people can change, they had better responses to stress, in part because they felt like they had the resources to deal with the demanding situation. Students who got the growth mindset intervention(干预) showed less-contracted blood vessel and their hearts pumped more blood—both of which contributed to more oxygen getting to the brain, and, ultimately,better performance on the speech and mental math tasks.
J) These findings lead to several possibilities that we are investigating further. First, we are working to replicate(复制) these findings in more diverse school communities.We want to know in which types of schools and for which kinds of students these growth mindset ideas help young people adapt to the challenges of high school. We also hope to learn how teachers, parents or school counselors can help students keep their ongoing academic or social difficulties in perspective. We wonder what would happen if schools helped to make beliefs about the potential for change and improvement a larger feature of the overall school culture, especially for students starting the ninth grade.

Section C
 Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Educators and business leaders have more in common than it may seem. Teachers want to prepare students for a successful future. Technology companies have an interest in developing a workforce with the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) skills needed to grow the company and advance the industry. How can they work together to achieve these goals? Play may be the answer.
　　　Focusing on STEM skills is important, but the reality is that STEM skills are enhanced and more relevant when combined with traditional, hands-on creative activities. This combination is proving to be the best way to prepare today’s children to be the makers and builders of tomorrow. That is why technology companies are partnering with educators to bring back good, old-fashioned play.
　　　In fact many experts argue that the most important 21st-century skills aren’t related to specific technologies or subject matter, but to creativity; skills like imagination, problem-finding and problem-solving, teamwork, optimism, patience and the ability to experiment and take risks. These are skills acquired when kids tinker(鼓捣小玩意). High-tech industries such as NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory have found that their best overall problem solvers were master tinkerers in their youth.
　　　There are cognitive(认知的）benefits of doing things the way we did as children—building something, tearing it down, then building it up again. Research shows that given 15 minutes of free play, four- and five-year-olds will spend a third of this time engaged in spatial, mathematical, and architectural activities. This type of play—especially with building blocks—helps children discover and develop key principles in math and geometry.
　　　If play and building are critical to 21st-century skill development, that’s really good news for two reasons: Children are born builders, makers, and creators, so fostering (培养)21st-century skills may be as simple as giving kids room to play, tinker and try things out, even as they grow older. Secondly, it doesn’t take 21st-century technology to foster 21st-century skills. This is especially important for under-resourced schools and communities. Taking whatever materials are handy and tinkering with them is a simple way to engage those important “maker” skills. And anyone, anywhere, can do it.
46. What does the author say about educators?
	A) They seek advice from technology companies to achieve teaching goals.
	B) They have been successful in preparing the workforce for companies.
	C) They help students acquire the skills needed for their future success.
	D) They partner with technology companies to enhance teaching efficiency.
47. How can educators better develop students’ STEM skills, according to the author?
	A) By blending them with traditional, stimulating activities.
	B) By inviting business leaders to help design curriculums.
	C) By enhancing students’ ability to think in a critical way.
	D) By showing students the best way to learn is through play.
48. How do children acquire the skills needed for the 21st century?
	A) By engaging in activities involving specific technologies.
	B) By playing with things to solve problems on their own. 
	C) By familiarizing themselves with high-tech gadgets.
	D) By mastering basic principles through teamwork.
49.What can we do to help children learn the basics of math and geometry?
	A) Stimulate their interest as early as possible.
	B) Spend more time playing games with them.
	C) Encourage them to make things with hands.

50. What does the author advise disadvantaged schools and communities to do?
	A) Train students to be makers to meet future market demands.
	B) Develop students’ creative skills with the resources available. 
	C) Engage students with challenging tasks to foster their creativity.
	D) Work together with companies to improve their teaching facilities.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Being an information technology, or IT, worker is not a job I envy. They are the ones who, right in the middle of a critical meeting, are expected to instantly fix the projector that’s no longer working. They have to tolerate the bad tempers of colleagues frustrated at the number of times they’ve had to call the help desk for the same issue. They are also the ones who know there are systems that are more powerful,reliable and faster, but their employer simply will not put up the funds to buy them.
　　　According to a recent survey, employees who have a job reliant on IT support consider IT a major source of job dissatisfaction. Through no fault of their own, they can suddenly find their productivity deteriorating or quality control non-existent. And there’s little they can do about it.
　　　The experience of using IT penetrates almost the entire work field. It has become a crucial part of employees’ overall work experience. When IT is operating as it should, employee self-confidence swells. Their job satisfaction, too, can surge when well-functioning machines relieve them of dull tasks or repetitive processes. But if there’s one thing that triggers widespread employee frustration, it’s an IT transformation project gone wrong, where swollen expectations have been popped and a long list of promised efficiencies have been reversed. This occurs when business leaders implement IT initiatives with little consideration of how those changes will impact the end user.
　　　Which is why managers should appreciate just how influential the IT user experience is to their employees, and exert substantial effort in ensuring their IT team eliminates programming errors and application crashes. Adequate and timely IT support should also be available to enable users to cope with technological issues at work. More importantly, IT practitioners need to understand what employees experience mentally when they use IT.
　　　Therefore, businesses need to set up their IT infrastructure so that it is designed to fit in with their employees’ work, rather than adjust their work to fit in with the company’s IT limitations.
51. What does the author say about working in IT?
　　A) It is envied by many.
　　B) It does not appeal to him.
　　C) It is financially rewarding.
　　D) It does not match his abilities.
52. What is the finding of a recent survey on employees who have a job reliant on IT support?
　　A) IT helps boost productivity.
　　B) IT helps improve quality control.
　　C) Many employees are deeply frustrated by IT.
　　D) Most employees rely heavily on IT in their work.
53. What is said to happen when IT is functioning properly?
　　A) There is a big boost in employees’ work efficiency.
　　B) Employees become more dependent on machines.
　　C) There are no longer any boring or repetitive tasks.
　　D) Employees become more confident in their work.
54. What should business leaders do before implementing new IT initiatives?
　　A) Consider the various expectations of their customers.
B) Draw up a list of the efficiencies to be promised.
　　C) Assess the swollen cost of training the employees.
　　D) Think about the possible effects on their employees.
55.How can a business help improve its employees’ experience in using IT?
　　A) By designing systems that suit their needs.
B) By ensuring that their mental health is sound.
　　C) By adjusting their work to suit the IT system.
　　D) By offering them regular in-service training.

　　　Social isolation poses more health risks than obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day, according to research published by Brigham Young University. The   		26   is that loneliness is a huge, if silent, risk factor.
　　　Loneliness affects physical health in two ways. First, it produces stress hormones that can lead to many health problems. Second, people who live alone are less likely to go to the doctor   27				  , to exercise or to eat a healthy diet. 
　　　Public health experts in many countries are   28			   how to address widespread loneliness in our society. Last year Britain even appointed a minister for loneliness. “Loneliness   		29   almost every one of us at some point,” its minister for loneliness Baroness Barran said. “It can lead to very serious health   		30   for individuals who become isolated and disconnected.”
　　　Barran started a “Let’s Talk Loneliness” campaign that   31		   difficult conversations across Britain. He is now supporting “  32 		  benches,” which are public seating areas where people are encouraged to go and chat with one another. The minister is also   33 				  to stop public transportation from being cut in ways that leave people isolated.
　　　More than one-fifth of adults in both the United States and Britain said in a 2018   34 									  that they often or always feel lonely. More than half of American adults are unmarried, and researchers have found that even among those who are married, 30% of relationships are   		35								   strained. A quarter of Americans now live alone, and as the song says, one is the loneliest number.

Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
What happens when a language has no words for numbers?
A)	Numbers do not exist in all cultures. There are numberless hunter-gatherers in Amazonia, living along branches of the world’s largest river tree. Instead of using words for precise quantities, these people rely exclusively on terms similar to “a few” or “some.” In contrast, our own lives are governed by numbers. As you read this, you are likely aware of what time it is, how old you are, your checking account balance, your weight and so on. The exact numbers we think with impact everything in our lives.
B)	But, in a historical sense, number-conscious people like us are the unusual ones. For the bulk of our species’ approximately 200,000-year lifespan, we had no means of precisely representing quantities. What’s more, the 7,000 or so languages that exist today vary dramatically in how they utilize numbers. 
C)	Speakers of anumeric, or numberless, languages offer a window into how the invention of numbers reshaped the human experience. Cultures without numbers, or with only one or two precise numbers, include the Munduruku and Piraha in Amazonia. Researchers have also studied some adults in Nicaragua who were never taught number words.Without numbers, healthy human adults struggle to precisely distinguish and recall quantities as low as four. In an experiment, a researcher will place nuts into a can one at a time and then remove them one by one. The person watching is asked to signal when all the nuts have been removed. Responses suggest that anumeric people have some trouble keeping track of how many nuts remain in the can, even if there are only four or five in total.
D)	This and many other experiments have led to a simple conclusion: When people do not have numbers word, they struggle to make quantitative distinctions that probably seem natural to someone like you or me. While only a small portion of the world’s languages are anumeric or nearly anumeric, they demonstrate that number words are not a human universal.
E)	It is worth stressing that these anumeric people are cognitively (在认知方面) normal, well-adapted to the surroundings they have dominated for centuries. As a child, I spent some time living with anumeric people, the Piraha who live along the banks of the black Maici River. Like other outsiders, I was continually impressed by their superior understanding of the ecology we shared. Yet numberless people struggle with tasks that require precise discrimination between quantities. Perhaps this should be unsurprising. After all, without counting, how can someone tell whether there are, say, seven or eight coconuts(椰子)in a tree? Such seemingly straightforward distinctions become blurry through numberless eyes.
F)	This conclusion is echoed by work with anumeric children in industrialized societies. Prior to being spoon-fed number words, children can only approximately discriminate quantities beyond three. We must be handed the cognitive tools of numbers before we can consistently and easily recognize higher quantities. In fact, acquiring the exact meaning of number words is a painstaking process that takes children years. Initially, kids learn numbers much like they learn letters. They recognize that numbers are organized sequentially, but have little awareness of what each individual number means. With time, they start to understand that a given number represents a quantity greater by one than the number coming before it. This “successor principle” is part of the foundation of our numerical(数字的)cognition, but requires extensive practice to understand.
G)	None of us, then, is really a “numbers person.” We are not born to handle quantitative distinctions skillfully. In the absence of the cultural traditions that fill our lives with numbers from infancy, we would all struggle with even basic quantitative distinctions. Number words and their written forms transform our quantitative reasoning as they are introduced into our cognitive experience by our parents, peers and school teachers. The process seems so normal that we sometimes think of it as a natural part of growing up, but it is not.Human brains come equipped with certain quantitative instincts that are refined with age, but these instincts are very limited.
H)	Compared with other mammals, our numerical instincts are not as remarkable as many assume. We even share some basic instinctual quantitative reasoning with distant non-mammalian relatives like birds. Indeed, work with some other species suggests they too can refine their quantitative thought if they are introduced to the cognitive power tools we call numbers.
I)	So, how did we ever invent “unnatural” numbers in the first place? The answer is, literally, at your fingertips. The bulk of the world’s languages use base-10, base-20 or base-5 number systems. That is, these smaller numbers are the basis of larger numbers. English is a base-10 or decimal (十进制的) language, as evidenced by words like 14(“four”+“10”) and 31 (“three”x “10”+“one”). We speak a decimal language because an ancestral tongue, proto-Indo-European, was decimally based. Proto-Indo-European was decimally oriented because, as in so many cultures, our ancestors’ hands served as the gateway to the realization that “five fingers on one hand is the same as five fingers on the other.” Such momentary thoughts were represented in words and passed down across generations. This is why the word “five” in many languages is derived from the word for “hand.” Most number systems, then, are the by-product of two key factors: the human capacity for language and our inclination for focusing on our hands and fingers. This manual fixation—an indirect by-product of walking upright on two legs—has helped yield numbers in most cultures, but not all.
J)	Cultures without numbers also offer insight into the cognitive influence of particular numeric traditions. Consider what time it is. Your day is ruled by minutes and seconds, but these concepts are not real in any physical sense and are nonexistent to numberless people. Minutes and seconds are the verbal and written representations of an uncommon base-60 number system used in ancient Mesopotamia. They reside in our minds, numerical artifacts (人工制品) that not all humans inherit conceptually.
K) Research on the language of numbers shows, more and more, that one of our species’ key characteristics is tremendous linguistic (语言的) and cognitive diversity. If we are to truly understand how much our cognitive lives differ cross-culturally, we must continually explore the depths of our species’ linguistic diversity.
36. It is difficult for amumeric people to keep track of the change in numbers even when the total is very small.
37.	Human numerical instincts are not so superior to those of other mammals as is generally believed.
38.	The author emphasizes being anumeric does not affect one’s cognitive ability.

Section C
Directions:There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Sugar shocked. That describes the reaction of many Americans this week following revelations that,50 years ago, the sugar industry paid Harvard scientists for research that shifted the focus away from sugar’s role in heart disease—and put the spotlight(注意的中心) squarely on dietary fat.
　　　What might surprise consumers is just how many present-day nutrition studies are still funded by the food industry. Nutrition scholar Marion Nestle of New York University spent a year informally tracking industry-funded studies on food. “Roughly 90% of nearly 170 studies favored the sponsor’s interest,”Nestle tells us. Other systematic reviews support her conclusions.
　　　For instance, studies funded by Welch Foods—the brand behind Welch’s 100% Grape Juice—found that drinking Concord grape juice daily may boost brain function. Another, funded by Quaker Oats, concluded, as a Daily Mail story put it, that “hot oatmeal（燕麦粥)breakfast keeps you full for longer.”
　　　Last year, The New York Times revealed how Coca-Cola was funding well-known scientists and organizations promoting a message that, in the battle against weight gain, people should pay more attention to exercise and less to what they eat and drink. Coca-Cola also released data detailing its funding of several medical institutions and associations between 2010 and 2015.
　　　“It’s certainly a problem that so much research in nutrition and health is funded by industry,”says Bonnie Liebman, director of nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “When the food industry pays for research, it often gets what it pays for.”And what it pays for is often a pro-industry finding.
　　　Given this environment, consumers should be skeptical (怀疑的) when reading the latest finding in nutrition science and ignore the latest study that pops up on your news feed. “Rely on health experts who’ve reviewed all the evidence,” Liebman says, pointing to the official government Dietary Guidelines, which are based on reviews of hundreds of studies.
　　　“And that expert advice remains pretty simple,” says Nestle. “We know what healthy diets are—lots of vegetables, not too much junk food, balanced calories. Everything else is really difficult to do experimentally.”
46. What did Harvard scientists do 50 years ago?
A) They raised public awareness of the possible causes of heart disease.
B) They turned public attention away from the health risks of sugar to fat.
C) They placed the sugar industry in the spotlight with their new findings.
　　D) They conducted large-scale research on the role of sugar in people’s health.
47. What does Marion Nestle say about present-day nutrition studies?
A)They took her a full year to track and analyze.
B) Most of them are based on systematic reviews. 
C) They depend on funding from the food industries.
　　D) Nearly all of them serve the purpose of the funders.
48. What did Coca-Cola-funded studies claim?
A) Exercise is more important to good health than diet.
B) Choosing what to eat and drink is key to weight control.
C) Drinking Coca-Cola does not contribute to weight gain.
　　D) The food industry plays a major role in fighting obesity.
49. What does Liebman say about industry-funded research?
A) It simply focuses on nutrition and health.
B) It causes confusion among consumers.
C) It rarely results in objective findings.
　　D) It runs counter to the public interest.
50. What is the author’s advice to consumers?
A) Follow their intuition in deciding what to eat.
B) Be doubtful of diet experts’ recommendations.
C) Ignore irrelevant information on their news feed.
　　D) Think twice about new nutrition research findings.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Success was once defined as being able to stay at a company for a long time and move up the corporate ladder. The goal was to reach the top, accumulate wealth and retire to a life of ease. My father is a successful senior executive. In 35 years, he worked for only three companies.
　　　When I started my career, things were already different. If you weren’t changing companies every three or four years, you simply weren’t getting ahead in your career. But back then, if you were a consultant or freelancer (自由职业者), people would wonder what was wrong with you. They would assume you had problems getting a job.
　　　Today, consulting or freelancing for five businesses at the same time is a badge of honor. It shows how valuable an individual is. Many companies now look to these “ultimate professionals” to solve problems their full-time teams can’t. Or they save money by hiring “ top-tier(顶尖的) experts” only for particular projects.
　　　Working at home or in cafes, starting businesses of their own, and even launching business ventures that eventually may fail, all indicate “initiative,” “creativity,” and “adaptability,” which are desirable qualities in today’s workplace. Most important, there is a growing recognition that people who balance work and play, and who work at what they are passionate about, are more focused and productive, delivering greater value to their clients.
　　　Who are these people? They are artists, writers, programmers, providers of office services and career advice: What’s needed now is a marketplace platform specifically designed to bring freelancers and clients together. Such platforms then become a place to feature the most experienced, professional, and creative talent, This is where they conduct business, where a sense of community reinforces the culture and values of the gig economy(零工经济), and where success is rewarded with good reviews that encourage more business.
　　　Slowly but surely, these platforms create a bridge between traditional enterprises and this emerging economy. Perhaps more important, as the global economy continues to be disrupted by technology and other massive change, the gig economy will itself become an engine of economic and social transformation.
51. What does the author use the example of his father to illustrate?
A) How long people took to reach the top of their career.
B) How people accumulated wealth in his father’s time.
C) How people viewed success in his father’s time.
　　D) How long people usually stayed in a company.
52. Why did people often change jobs when the author started his career?
A) It was considered a fashion at that time.
B) It was a way to advance in their career.
C) It was a response to the changing job market.
　　D) It was difficult to keep a job for long.
53. What does the author say about people now working for several businesses at the same time?
A) They are often regarded as most treasured talents.
B) They are.able to bring their potential into fuller play.
C) They have control over their life and work schedules.
　　D) They feel proud of being outstanding problem solver.
54. What have businesses come to recognize now?
A) Who is capable of solving problems with ease.
B) How people can be more focused and productive.
C) What kind of people can contribute more to them.
　　D) Why some people are more passionate about work.
55. What does the author say about the gig economy?
A) It may force companies to reform their business practice.
B) It may soon replace the traditional economic model.
C) It will drive technological progress on a global scale.
　　D) It will bring about radical economic and social changes.

Section A
　　Nowadays you can’t buy anything without then being asked to provide a rating of a company’s performance on a five-star scale.
　　I’ve been asked to rate my “store   26  ” on the EFTPOS terminal before I can pay. Even the most   27   activities, such as calling Telstra or picking up a parcel from Australia Post, are followed by texts or emails with surveys asking, “How did we do?”
　　Online purchases are   28   followed up by a customer satisfaction survey. Companies are so
  29   for a hit of stars that if you delete the survey the company sends you another one.
　　We’re   30   to rate our apps when we’ve barely had a chance to use them. One online course provider I use asks you what you think of the course after you’ve only completed   31   2 per cent of it. 
　　Economist Jason Murphy says ,that companies use customer satisfaction ratings because a  32  
display of star feedback has become the nuclear power sources of the modern economy.
　　However, you can’t help but   33   if these companies are basing their business on fabrications(捏造的东西). I   34   that with online surveys 1 just click the   35   that’s closest to my mouse cursor (光标) to get the damn thing off my screen. Often the star rating I give has far more to do with the kind of day I’m having than the purchase 1 just made.

Section B
　　　 Science of setbacks:How failure can improve career prospects
　　　A) How do early career setbacks affect our long-term success?Failures can help us learn and overcome our fears. But disasters can still wound us. They can screw us up and set us back.Wouldn’t it be nice if there was genuine, scientifically documented truth to the expression “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger”?
　　　B)	One way social scientists have probed the effects of career setbacks is to look at scientists of very similar qualifications. These scientists, for reasons that are mostly arbitrary, either just missed getting a research grant or just barely made it. In social sciences, this is known as examining “near misses” and “narrow wins” in areas where merit is subjective. That allows researchers to measure only the effects of being chosen or not. Studies in this area have found conflicting results. In the competitive game of biomedical science,research has been done on scientists who narrowly lost or won grant money. It suggests that narrow winners become even bigger winners down the line. In other words, the rich get richer.
　　　C)	A 2018 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, for example, followed researchers in the Netherlands.Researchers concluded that those who just barely qualified for a grant. were able to get twice as much money within the next eight years as those who just missed out. And the narrow winners were 50 percent more likely to be given a professorship.
　　　D)	Others in the US have found similar effects with National Institutes of Health early-career fellowships launching narrow winners far ahead of close losers. The phenomenon is often referred to as the Matthew effect, inspired by the Bible’s wisdom that to those who have, more will be given. There’s a good explanation for the phenomenon in the book The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success by Albert Laszlo Barabasi. According to Barabasi, it’s easier and less risky for those in positions of power to choose to hand awards and funding to those who’ve already been so recognized.
　　　E)	This is bad news for the losers.Small early career setbacks seem to have a disproportionate effect down the line. What didn’t kill them made them weaker. But other studies using the same technique have shown there’s sometimes no penalty to a near miss. Students who just miss getting into top high schools or universities do just as well later in life as those who just manage to get accepted. In this case, what didn’t kill them simply didn’t matter. So is there any evidence that setbacks might actually improve our career prospects? There is now.
　　　F)	In a study published in Nature Communications, Northwestern University sociologist Dashun Wang, tracked more than 1,100 scientists who were on the border between getting a grant and missing out between 1990 and 2005. He followed various measures of performance over the next decade. These included how many papers they authored and how influential those papers were, as measured by the number of subsequent citations. As expected, there was a much higher rate of attrition (减员) among scientists who didn’t get grants. But among those who stayed on, the close losers performed even better than the narrow winners. To make sure this wasn’t by chance, Wang conducted additional tests using different performance measures. He examined how many times people were first authors on influential studies, and the like.
　　　G)	One straightforward reason close losers might outperform narrow winners is that the two groups have comparable ability. In Wang’s study, he selected the most determined, passionate scientists from the loser group and culled (剔除) what he deemed the weakest members of the winner group. Yet the persevering losers still came out on top.He thinks that being a close loser might give people a psychological boost, or the proverbial kick in the pants.
　　　H)	Utrecht University sociologist Arnout van de Rijt was the lead author on the 2018 paper showing the rich get richer. He said the new finding is apparently reasonable and worth some attention. His own work showed that although the narrow winners did get much more money in the near future, the actual performance of the close losers was just as good.
　　　I)	He said the people who should be paying regard to the Wang paper are the funding agents who distribute government grant money. After all, by continuing to pile riches on the narrow winners, the taxpayers are not getting the maximum bang for their buck if the close losers are performing just as well or even better. There’s a huge amount of time and effort that goes into the process of selecting who gets grants, he said, and the latest research shows that the scientific establishment is not very good at distributing money. “Maybe we should spend less money trying to figure out who is better than who,” he said, suggesting that some more equal dividing up of money might be more productive and more efficient. Van de Rijt said he’s not convinced that losing out gives people a psychological boost. It may yet be a selection effect. Even though Wang tried to account for this by culling the weakest winners, it’s impossible to know which of the winners would have quit had they found themselves on the losing side.
　　　J)	For his part, Wang said that in his own experience, losing did light a motivating fire. He recalled a recent paper he submitted to a journal, which accepted it only to request extensive editing, and then reversed course and rejected it. He submitted the unedited version to a more respected journal and got accepted.
　　　K)	In sports and many areas of life, we think of failures as evidence of something we could have done better. We regard these disappointments as a fate we could have avoided with more careful preparation, different training, a better strategy, or more focus. And there it makes sense that failures show us the road to success. These papers deal with a kind of failure people have little control over—rejection. Others determine who wins and who loses. But at the very least, the research is starting to show that early setbacks don’t have to be fatal. They might even make us better at our jobs. Getting paid like a winner, though? That’s a different matter.
　　　36.	Being a close loser could greatly motivate one to persevere in their research.
　　　37.	Grant awarders tend to favor researchers already recognized in their respective fields.
　　　38.	Suffering early setbacks might help people improve their job performance.
　　　39.	Research by social scientists on the effects of career setbacks has produced contradictory findings.
　　　40.	It is not to the best interest of taxpayers to keep giving money to narrow winners.
　　　41.	Scientists who persisted in research without receiving a grant made greater achievements than those who got one with luck, as suggested in one study.
　　　42.	A research paper rejected by one journal may get accepted by another.
　　　43.	According to one recent study, narrow winners of research grants had better chances to be promoted to professors.
　　　44.	One researcher suggests it might be more fruitful to distribute grants on a relatively equal basis.
　　　45.	Minor setbacks in their early career may have a strong negative effect on the career of close losers.
Section C
Directions:There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.（淘宝店铺：光速考研工作室）
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Boredom has become trendy. Studies point to how boredom is good for creativity and innovation, as well as mental health. It is found that people are more creative following the completion of a tedious task. When people are bored, they have an increase in “associative thought”—the process of making new connections between ideas, which is linked to innovative thinking. These studies are impressive, but in reality, the benefits of boredom may be related to having time to clear your mind, be quiet, or daydream.
　　　In our stimulation-rich world, it seems unrealistic that boredom could occur at all. Yet, there are valid reasons boredom may feel so painful. As it turns out, boredom might signal the fact that you have a need that isn’t being met.
　　　Our always-on world of social media may result in more connections, but they are superficial and can get in the way of building a real sense of belonging. Feeling bored may signal the desire for a greater sense of community and the feeling that you fit in with others around you. So take the step of joining an organization to build face-to-face relationships. You’ll find depth that you won’t get from your screen no matter how many likes you get on your post.
　　　Similar to the need for belonging, bored people often report that they feel a limited sense of meaning. It’s a fundamental human need to have a larger purpose and to feel like we’re part of something bigger than ourselves. When people are bored, they’re more likely to feel less meaning in their lives. If you want to reduce boredom and increase your sense of meaning, seek work where you can make a unique contribution, or find a cause you can support with your time and talent.
　　　If your definition of boredom is being quiet, mindful, and reflective, keep it up. But if you’re struggling with real boredom and the emptiness it provokes, consider whether you might seek new connections and more significant challenges. These are the things that will genuinely relieve boredom and make you more effective in the process.
46. What have studies found about boredom?
A) It facilitates innovative thinking.
B) It is a result of doing boring tasks.
C) It helps people connect with others.
　　D) It does harm to one’s mental health.
47. What does the author say boredom might indicate?
A) A need to be left alone.
B) A desire to be fulfilled.
C) A conflict to be resolved.
　　D) A feeling to be validated.
48. What do we learn about social media from the passage?
A) It may be an obstacle to expanding one’s connections.
B) It may get in the way of enhancing one’s social status.
C) It may prevent people from developing a genuine sense of community.
　　D) It may make people feel that they ought to fit in with the outside world.
49. What does the author suggest people do to get rid of boredom?
A) Count the likes they get on their posts.
B) Reflect on how they relate to others.
C) Engage in real-life interactions.
　　D) Participate in online discussions.
50. What should people do to enhance their sense of meaning?
A) Try to do something original.
B) Confront significant challenges.
C) Define boredom in their unique way.
　　D) Devote themselves to a worthy cause.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Can you remember what you ate yesterday? If asked, most people will be able to give a vague description of their main meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner. But can you be sure you’ve noted every snack bar in your car, or every handful of nuts at your desk? Most people will have a feeling that they’ve missed something out.
　　　We originally had this suspicion back in 2016, puzzled by the fact that national statistics showed calorie consumption falling dramatically over past decades. We found reliable evidence that people were drastically under-reporting what they ate.
　　　Now the Office for National Statistics has confirmed that we are consuming 50% more calories than our national statistics claim.
　　　Why is this happening? We can point to at least three potential causes. One is the rise in obesity levels itself. Under-reporting rates are much higher for obese people, because they simply consume more food, and thus have more to remember.
　　　Another cause is that the proportion of people who are trying to lose weight has been increasing over time. People who want to lose weight are more likely to under-report their eating—regardless of whether they are overweight or not. This may be driven partly by self-deception or “wishful thinking”.
　　　The final potential cause is an increase in snacking and eating out over recent decades —both in terms of how often they happen and how much they contribute to our overall energy intake. Again, there is evidence that food consumed out of the home is one of the most poorly recorded categories in surveys.
　　　So, what’s the message conveyed? For statistics, we should invest in more accurate measurement options. For policy, we need to focus on options that make it easy for people to eat fewer calories. If people do not know how much they are eating, it can be really hard for them to stick to a diet. Also, we should be looking for new ways to ensure what people eat wouldn’t have much impact on their waistlines. If this works, it won’t matter if they can’t remember what they ate yesterday.
51. What did the author suspect back in 2016?
A) Calorie consumption had fallen drastically over the decades.
B) Most people surveyed were reluctant to reveal what they ate.
C) The national statistics did not reflect the actual calorie consumption.
　　D) Most people did not include snacks when reporting their calorie intake.
52. What has the Office for National Statistics verified?
A) People’s calorie intake was far from accurately reported.
B) The missing out of main meals leads to the habit of snacking.
C) The nation’s obesity level has much to do with calorie intake.
　　D) Calorie consumption is linked to the amount of snacks one eats.
53. What do we learn about obese people from the passage?
A) They usually keep their eating habits a secret.
They overlook the potential causes of obesity.
C) They cannot help eating more than they should.
　　D) They have difficulty recalling what they have eaten.
54. What often goes unnoticed in surveys on food consumption?
A) The growing trend of eating out.
B) The potential causes of snacking.
C) People’s home energy consumption.
　　D) People’s changing diet over the years.
55. What does the author suggest policymakers do about obesity?
A) Remind people to cut down on snacking.
B) Make sure people eat non-fattening food.
C) Ensure people don’t miss their main meals.
　　D) See that people don’t stick to the same diet.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　Many people believe that passion and commitment are the foundations of strong romantic relationships. But a relationship is made of two 			26					individuals. And the personality traits (特性) these individuals   27   or lack can often make a relationship more- or less- likely to  	28  . Recent research has found that one trait in particular—humility(谦逊)—	is an important indicator of successful relationships.
　　Humility can sometimes be   29   with a lack of confidence. But researchers have come to realize that being humble generally indicates the   		30   of deeply admirable personal qualities. Being humble means you have the ability to accurately   31   your deficiencies without denying your skills and strengths. For example, you might recognize that you are intelligent, but realize that you are not a  			32	 . Thus, humility leads to    an honest view of one’s own advantages and shortcomings. Humble people do not ignore, avoid, or try to deny their limits or deficiencies. They can	  33		  	mistakes, see value in things that are far from perfect and identify areas for improvement.
　　Perhaps it is not   34		  , then, that humility appears to be a huge asset to relationships. One study found that people tend to rate this quality  		 35   in their spouse. The study also found that someone who is humble is more likely to initiate a romantic relationship, perhaps because they are less likely to see themselves as “too good” for someone else. Thus, a humble partner might be your ideal partner.

Section B
There’s a stress gap between men and women 
A) 	“I used to work very hard. I love to create things, grow them and solve problems, “said Meng Li, a successful app developer in San Francisco. “I didn’t really care about my mind and my body until they decided to go on strike.” 
B) 	Ms. Li said her stress led to sleeplessness. When she did sleep, she experienced “problem-solving dreams,” which left her feeling unrested when she woke up. “After I became a first-time mother, I quickly realized I was so busy caring for other people and work that I felt like I’d lost myself,” she said.
C) 	It’s a common story- one we frequently ridicule and readily dismiss, for example,    by claiming that women tend to complain more than men, despite the growing sum    of research that underlines the problem. Women are twice as likely to suffer from  severe stress and anxiety as men, according to a 2016 study published in The Journal  of Brain & Behavior. The American Psychological Association reports a gender gap year after year showing that women consistently report higher stress levels. Clearly,   a stress gap exists.
D)	“The difference is not really news to me, as a clinical psychologist,” said Erin Joyce,   a women and couples therapist in Los Angeles. “It’s been well documented in extensive research over the years that prevalence rates for the majority of the anxiety disorders are higher in women than men.” Some people may argue that this is merely reported data, and they say many men feel the same pressures as women in terms of fulfilling responsibilities at work and home. In other words, we’re all really, really stressed.
E) 	“The difference, however, is in the nature and scope of these responsibilities in the home environment in particular,” Dr. Joyce said. For example, the United Nations reported that women do nearly three times as much unpaid domestic work as men. The problem is, housework is often overlooked as work, even though it is often as laborious (or in some cases, more so) as any paid job. As the scholar Silvia Federici put it in 1975, the unpaid nature of domestic work reinforces the assumption that “housework is not work, thus preventing women from struggling against it.”
F) 	It’s not just inside the home, though. Research from Nova Southeastern University found that female managers were more likely than male managers to display “surface acting,” or forcing emotions that are not wholly felt. “They expressed optimism, calmness and sympathy even when these were not the emotions that they were actually feeling,” the study said.
G) 	Surface acting is a prime example of “emotional labor,” a concept that the writer Jess Zimmerman made familiar in a 2015 essay. The essay sparked a massive thread on the internet community blog MetaFilter. Hundreds of women spoke up about their own experience with emotional labor: the duties that are expected of them, but go unnoticed. These invisible duties become apparent only when you don’t do them. Like domestic labor, emotional labor is generally dismissed and not labeled work. But research shows it can be just as exhausting as paid work. Emotional labor can lead to difficulty in sleeping and family conflict. Sure, circumstantial stress, like losing a job, may lead to these same issues. But emotional labor is not circumstantial. It’s an enduring responsibility based on the socialized gender role of women.
H) 	Like Ms. Li, many women try to manage the added stress to reach what Dr. Joyce said was an unattainable ideal. “Some professional women aim to do it all. They want to reach the top of the corporate ladder and fly like supermom,” she said. When women don’t reach this ideal, they feel guilty; and even more stressed. After her own struggle with this, Ms. Li took a step back and used her experience to build Sanity & Self, a self-care app and platform for overworked women. "The realizations I had in that process helped me gain insights and ultimately got me ready to integrate self- care into my daily life,“ she said.
I) 	The stress problem extends beyond mental health when you consider the link between stress, anxiety and heart health. Worse, most of what we know about heart disease comes from studies involving men. However, “there are many reasons to think that  it’s different in women,” Harvard Medical School reported. For example, women are more likely to experience disturbed sleep, anxiety and unusual fatigue before a heart attack. Stress is so normalized that it is easy for women to shrug off those symptoms as simply the consequences of stress. Many women also do not experience chest pain before a heart attack the way men do, which leads to fewer women discovering problematic heart issues. Harvard reports that women are “much more likely than men to die within a year of having a heart attack” and “many women say their physicians sometimes don’t even recognize the symptoms.” 
J) 	The good news is, women are more likely than men to take charge of their stress and manage it, the American Psychological Association reports. The concept of self-care,  at its core, is quite simple. “The basics of adequate sleep, healthy diet and exercise are  a good place to start,” Dr. Joyce said. “Support from trusted relationships is vital.   This includes professional support from various health and wellness providers if stress is becoming increasingly overwhelming.”
K) 	Disconnecting from work and home responsibilities is also obviously important.    But it’s much easier said than done. It is important to understand what causes your stress in the first place. “Get really specific with what’s stressing you out,” Ms. Li said.     “We often chalk up our stress to broad experiences like work. But work stress can take many different forms. Is a colleague being disrespectful of your time? Is a boss undermining your day-to-day control over decision making? These are different causes of stress and can benefit from different kinds of self-care.”
L） Ideally, your spouse or partner will be supportive, rather than dismissive, of your stress. It is important to talk through these issues before they come to a head. “Women working outside of the home should make an effort to have a conscious conversation with their partners about more equitable sharing of household and family responsibilities,” Dr. Joyce said. 
36. 	Some career women who aim high tend to feel guilty if they fail to achieve their goals.
37. 	The unpaid housework done by women is triple that done by men. 
38.	It is reported that women consistently suffer more from severe stress than men. 
39. 	Women are advised to identify the specific causes of their stress so that steps can be taken to deal with it. 
40. 	One study showed that women managers often expressed positive emotions that they didn’t really feel. 
41. 	Women tend to mistake signs of heart attacks for symptoms of stress. 
42. 	For a time an app developer in America was so busy attending to work and family that she suffered from sleeplessness. 
43. 	The emotional labor women do is noticed only when it is not done. 
44. 	Dr. Joyce suggests that apart from self-care, women should seek professional support if they experience severe stress. 
45. 	Some people believe that there may not exist a stress gap between men and women.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　As many office workers adapt to remote work, cities may undergo fundamental change if offices remain under-utilized. Who will benefit if working from home becomes the norm?
　　Employers argue they make considerable savings on real estate when workers shift from office to home work. However, these savings result from passing costs on to workers.
　　Unless employees are fully compensated, this could become a variant of parasitic  (寄生的)capitalism, whereby corporate profits increasingly rely on extracting value from the public—and now personal—realm, rather than on generating new value.
　　Though employers are backed by a chorus of remote work advocates, others note the loneliness, reduced productivity and inefficiencies of extended remote work.
　　If working from home becomes permanent, employees will have to dedicate part of their private space to work. This requires purchasing desks, chairs and office equipment.
　　It also means having private space dedicated to work: the space must be heated, cleaned, maintained and paid for. That depends on many things, but for purposes of illustration, I have run some estimates for Montreal. The exercise is simple but   important, since it brings these costs out of the realm of speculation into the realm of meaningful discussion.
　　Rough calculations show that the savings made by employers when their staff works from home are of similar value to the compensation workers should receive for setting up offices at home.
　　What does this mean for offices in cities? One of two things may happen: Employers pass these costs onto employees. This would be a form of expropriation(侵占),       with employees absorbing production costs that have traditionally been paid by the employer. This represents a considerable transfer of value from employees to employers.
　　When employees are properly compensated, employers’ real estate savings will     be modest. If savings are modest, then the many advantages of working in offices—such    as lively atmosphere, rapidity of communication, team-building and acclimatization      (适应环境)of new employees—will encourage employers to shelve the idea of remote work and, like Yahoo in 2013, encourage employees to work most of the time from corporate office space. 
46. What does the author say about working from home?
　　A) It will become the norm sooner or later.
　　B) It requires employees to adapt promptly.
　　C) It benefits employers at the expense of employees.
　　D) It will force cities to transform their infrastructure. 
47. Why do some people oppose working from home?
　　A) It discourages team spirit. 	C) It undermines traditional values.
　　B) It invades employees’ privacy. 		D) It negatively impacts productivity. 
48. Why did the author run the estimates for Montreal?
　　A) To provide convincing data for serious discussion.
　　B) To illustrate the ongoing change in working patterns.
　　C) To show the impact of remote working on productivity.
　　D) To exemplify how remote working affects the economy. 
49. What can we conclude from the author’s calculations?
　　A) There is no point in transferring office work to working from home.
　　B) Employees can benefit as much from remote working as their employers.
　　C) Employers’ gain from remote working should go to employees as compensation.
　　D) Effective measures should be taken to motivate employees to set up offices at home. 
50. What is the author’s opinion on working from home?
　　A) It should be avoided if possible.
　　B) It is only a temporary measure.
　　C) It can reduce companies’ real estate costs.
　　D) It may affect employees’ corporate loyalty.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　The human thirst for knowledge is the driving force behind our successful development as a species. But curiosity can also be dangerous, leading to setbacks or even downfalls. Given curiosity’s complexity, scientists have found it hard to define.
　　While pinning down a definition has proven tricky, the general consensus is it’s some means of information gathering. Psychologists also agree curiosity is intrinsically (内在地) motivated.
　　Curiosity covers such a large set of behaviors that there probably isn’t any single “curiosity gene” that makes humans wonder about and explore their environment. That said, curiosity does have a genetic component. Genes and the environment interact in many complex ways to shape individuals and guide their behavior, including their curiosity.
　　Regardless of their genetic makeup, infants have to learn an incredible amount of information in a short time, and curiosity is one of the tools humans have found to accomplish that gigantic task. 
　　Hundreds of studies show that infants prefer novelty. It’s what motivates non-human animals, human infants and probably human adults to explore and seek out new things before growing less interested in them after continued exposure.
　　But curiosity often comes with a cost.
　　In some situations, the stakes are low and failure is a healthy part of growth. For instance, many babies are perfectly proficient crawlers, but they decide to try walking because there’s more to see and do when they stand upright. But this milestone comes at a small cost. A study of 12- to 19-month-olds learning how to walk documented that these children fell down a lot. Seventeen times per hour, to be exact. But walking is faster than crawling, so this motivates expert crawlers to transition to walking.
　　Sometimes, however, testing out a new idea can lead to disaster. For instance, the Inuit people of the Arctic regions have created incredible modes to deal with the challenges of living in northern climates, but what we forget about are the tens of thousands of people that tried and failed to make it in those challenging landscapes. 
51. What does the author say about curiosity?
　　A) It is too complex for non-scientists to understand.
　　B) It is the force that pushes human society forward.
　　C) It is a unique trait specific to the human race.
　　D) It is often the major cause for human failures. 
52. What is the general understanding of curiosity?
　　A) It motivates people to seek information.
　　B) It is destined to transform human genes. 
　　C) It does people more good than harm.
　　D) It underlies all human behaviors. 
53. What do we learn about how genes shape people’s behavior?
　　A) They determine people’s way of thinking.
　　B) They account for age differences in learning.
　　C) They enable people to undertake massive tasks.
　　D) They work in conjunction with the environment. 
54. What do numerous studies show about infants?
　　A) They are far more curious than adults.
　　B) They prefer to go after all that is novel.
　　C) They have different interests than adults.
　　D) They show non-human animal behaviors. 
55. What does the example of the Inuit people of the Arctic regions illustrate?
　　A) The cost of humans’ curiosity to explore.
　　B) The incredible harshness of cold weather.
　　C) The innovative ideas stemming from curiosity.
　　D) The importance of learning from past failures.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　It is commonly believed that the great English dramatist and poet William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-on-Avon on April 23, 1564. But it is impossible to know the	 				26	 day on which he was born.
　　Church records show he was baptized (施洗礼) on April 26, and three days      was a customary amount of time to wait before baptizing a newly born baby. Shakespeare’s date of death is   27   known, however: it was April 23, 1616. He was 52 and had retired to Stratford three years before.
　　Although few plays have been performed or analyzed as extensively as the        38 plays Shakespeare wrote, there are few surviving details about his life. This  						28					  of biographical information is due primarily to his social  				29  ; he was not a noble, but the son of a leather trader. 
　　Shakespeare   30   attended the grammar school in Stratford, where he would have studied Latin and read   31   literature. He did not go to university and at age 18 married Anne Hathaway, who was eight years his   32  . They had four children, including the twins, Hamnet and Judith. Nothing is known of the period between the birth of the twins and Shakespeare’s   33   as a dramatist in London in the early 1590s.
　　In a million words written over 20 years, he   34   the full range of human emotions and conflicts with a   35   that remains sharp today. As his great contemporary the poet and dramatist Ben Jonson said, “He was not of an age, but for all time.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
How to not be boring
A) 	Humans are creatures of habit. We love to establish a routine and stick with it. Then we often put ourselves on auto-pilot. Routines can be incredibly useful in helping you get things done. However, too much of a routine can also make you incredibly boring. Nevertheless, many people live lives that are boringly predictable, or live a life where everything is outlined or planned.
B) 	To tell the truth, interesting people are more popular among their friends. If you don’t arouse someone’s curiosity or brighten someone’s day, you probably come across as being a little bit dull. But that doesn’t mean your life has ended and you can’t do anything to change it. If you find yourself searching for something to say beyond small talk, try these tactics to find more interesting approaches to conversation.
C) 	Recently, I was at a gathering of colleagues when someone turned to me and asked,  “So, what’s new with you?” Ordinarily, I think I’m a good conversationalist. After all, it’s literally my job to talk to people and tell their stories or share their advice. And that’s not exactly an unexpected question. Still, the only “new-to-me” topics that came to mind were my daughter’s basketball tournament (锦标赛) and my feelings about that morning’s political headlines- neither amusing nor appropriate topics at that moment.
D) 	Oh, no, I thought. Have I become boring? But sharing our experiences in an authentic way to connect with other people is what makes us interesting, says associate professor Michael Pirson. The hesitation I felt in not sharing the ordinary things that were happening in my life, and the wild mental search for something more interesting, may have backfired and made me seem less interesting.
E) 	“If someone is making up some conversation that might be interesting, it’s probably not going to land well,” says Pirson, whose expertise includes trust and well-being, mindfulness, and humanistic management. “It’s going to feel like a made-up conversation that people don’t necessarily want to tune in to .” 
F)	The most interesting people aren’t those who’ve gone on some Eat, Pray, Love journey to find themselves. Instead, Pirson says, they’re those who examine the ordinary. “Often, the ’boring things’ may not be boring at all. Maybe they are actually little miracles,” he says. Share your observations about the world around you—interesting stories you heard or things you noticed—and you may be surprised by the universal connection they inspire.
G) 	This is essentially how Jessica Hagy starts her day. The author of How to Be Interesting: An Instruction Manual, Hagy spends a lot of time thinking about what’s interesting to her. People who are interesting are persistently curious, she says.
H) 	Think about the everyday things around you and ask questions about them. What is that roadside monument I see on my way to work every day? Who built that interesting building in my city? What nearby attractions haven’t I visited? Why do people do things that way? Use what you find to ask more questions and learn more about the world around you. “Having that sort of curiosity is almost like a protective gear from getting into boredom,” she says. And when you find things that are truly interesting to you, share them.
I) 	Television veteran Audrey Morrissey, executive producer of NBC’s The Voice, is always looking for what will make a person or story interesting to viewers: It’s usually a matter of individuality. “Having a strong point of view, signature style, or being a super-enthusiast in a particular field makes someone interesting,” she says. That means embracing what is truly interesting or unique about yourself. “Many people are ‘not boring’ in the way that they can carry a conversation or can be good at a social gathering, etc. To be interesting means that you have lived life, taken risks, traveled, sought out experience to learn for yourself and share with others,“ she says.
J) 	Of course, it’s possible to be a fountain of knowledge and a boring person, says public relations consultant Andrea Pass. Paying attention to the listener is an important part of having a conversation that’s interesting to both parties. Talking on and on about what’s interesting to you isn’t going to make you an interesting person, she says.
K) 	“If the listener is not paying attention, it’s your sign to shorten the story or change direction. Make sure to bring the audience into the conversation so that it is not one-sided,” Pass says. Be a better listener yourself, and give others opportunities to participate in the conversation by inviting them with questions or requests to share their own experiences or thoughts. (e. g. , “Now, tell me about your favorite book,” or “Have you ever been to that attraction?”) Questions are a powerful tool, especially when they encourage others to disclose information about themselves. A 2012 study from the University of California, Santa Barbara, found that roughly 40% of the time we are talking, we’re disclosing subjective information about our experience. And when we’re doing so, our brains are more engaged. So one strategy to leave others with the impression that you’re a sparkling conversation partner is to get others to talk about themselves. 
L) 	Being relatable is also essential, Morrissey says. “The best entertainment and storytelling comes from people who are relatable- those who don’t shy away from opening up but freely share who they are and what they care about. These are the people viewers most relate to and find interesting. Being authentic, honest, and vulnerable is always interesting.” 
M)	I have now come to realize that being boring, in actuality, is not only about who you are as a person, but also how you present yourself. No matter what, make sure you are having fun in life. Because when you are enjoying, people around you will begin to enjoy as well. Show some interest in them and they will definitely show some in you.  If you are a very reserved person, this could be a little difficult at first. But with a little effort, you can definitely improve. 
36. 	Pirson claims that some ordinary things may often prove to be miraculously interesting. 
37. 	To make a conversation interesting, it is important that you listen to the other party attentively. 
38. 	A person who is unable to stimulate others’ curiosity or make their life enjoyable may appear somewhat boring. 
39. 	Interesting people usually possess certain unique qualities, according to a TV program producer. 
40. 	Be interested in others and they are sure to be interested in you. 
41. 	The author considers himself usually good at conducting conversations. 
42.	Interesting people are always full of curiosity. 
43. 	Falling into a routine can turn a person into an utter bore. 
44. 	One strategy to be a good conversationalist is to motivate your partner to tell their own stories. 
45. 	Interesting as it might appear, a made-up conversation will probably turn out to be dull.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　With obesity now affecting 29% of the population in England, and expected to rise to 35% by 2030, should we now recognise it as a disease? Obesity, in which excess body fat has accumulated to such an extent that health may be adversely affected, meets the dictionary definition of disease, argues Professor John Wilding. He points out that more than 200 genes influence weight. “Thus body weight is strongly influenced by biology- it is not an individual’s fault if they develop obesity.” Yet the widespread view is that obesity is self-induced and that it is entirely the individual’s responsibility to do something about it. Recognising obesity as a chronic disease with severe complications rather than a lifestyle choice “should help reduce the stigma (耻辱) and discrimination experienced by many people with obesity,” he adds.
　　Professor Wilding disagrees that labelling a high proportion of the population as having a disease removes personal responsibility or may overwhelm health services, pointing out that other common diseases, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, require people to take action to manage their condition. He suggests that most people with obesity will eventually develop complications. “But unless we accept that obesity is a disease, we are not going to be able to tackle it,” he concludes.
　　But Dr. Richard Pile, a physician with a special interest in diabetes, argues that adopting this approach “could actually result in worse outcomes for individuals and society.” He believes that the dictionary definition of disease “is so vague that we can classify almost anything as a disease” and says the question is not whether we can, but whether we should, and to what end.
　　If labelling obesity as a disease was harmless then it wouldn’t really matter, he writes. But labelling obesity as a disease “risks reducing autonomy, disempowering and robbing people of the intrinsic(内在的)motivation that is such an important enabler of change.” What’s more, making obesity a disease “may not benefit patients, but it will benefit healthcare providers and the pharmaceutical(制药的)industry when health insurance and clinical guidelines promote treatment with drugs and surgery,” he warns. 
46. What does Professor John Wilding argue about obesity?
　　A) Its impact on society is expected to rise.
　　B) It is now too widespread to be neglected. 
　　C) It should be regarded as a genetic disease.
　　D) Its dictionary definition should be updated.
47. What is the popular view of obesity?
　　A) It is difficult to define.
　　B) It is a modern disease.
　　C) It has much to do with one’s genes.
　　D) It results from a lack of self-control.
48. Why are some people opposed to labelling obesity as a disease?
　　A) Obese people would not feel responsible to take any action.
　　B) Obese people would not be able to afford the medical costs.
　　C) Obese people would be overwhelmed with anxiety.
　　D) Obese people would be discriminated against. 
49. What does Dr. Richard Pile think of the dictionary definition of disease?
　　A) It is of no use in understanding obesity. 
　　B) It is too inclusive and thus lacks clarity. 
　　C) It helps little to solve patients’ problems.
　　D) It matters little to the debate over obesity. 
50. What is Dr. Richard Pile’s concern about classifying obesity as a disease?
　　A) It may affect obese people’s quality of life. 
　　B) It may accelerate the spread of obesity. 
　　C) It may cause a shortage of doctors.
　　D) It may do little good to patients.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　Nationwide, only about three percent of early childhood teachers are male in the U. S. Experts say this can have an impact on young children whose understanding of gender roles and identity are rapidly forming. Research has found that having access to diverse teachers is beneficial for children. For the youngest learners, it means they are more likely to get exposed to different varieties of play and communication. It also helps them develop healthy ideas around gender. 
　　“In our world and our society, we have very specific stereotypes (模式化形象)of gender roles,” said Mindi Reich-Shapiro, an assistant professor in the teacher education department of the Borough of Manhattan Community College, and one of the authors of a recent study. “It’s important for children to see other possibilities and other paths they can take.”
　　Despite mostly feeling supported by colleagues and family members, many of the male educators surveyed in the study reported facing social or cultural resistance in their careers as early education teachers. Some also reported that there were parents surprised or concerned that their child had a male teacher. And they had been advised by colleagues or other staff not to hug children. 
　　Reich-Shapiro and fellow researchers made several recommendations to increase male representation in the field. Low pay has long been acknowledged as a major issue in the early childhood field. Over 70% of male educators who said they intended to stay in the early education workforce noted an increased salary was a major motivating factor for them to commit to the career long-term. The report suggests paying all early childhood educators the way elementary school teachers are paid.
　　Cities and programs should establish support groups for male early childhood educators and provide mentoring and professional development advice for male educators and their program leaders.
　　The authors also suggest that traditional recruitment approaches for early childhood educators “do not address the gender gap in the field.” They recommend providing young men opportunities to work with children through training and volunteer programs, targeting groups of men who are considering a career change, such as fathers. 
51. What do we learn from the first paragraph about early childhood education in the U. S. ?
　　A) It helps raise children’s awareness of gender roles.
　　B) It exposes children to different ways of interaction.
　　C) It is negatively impacted by a lack of male teachers.
　　D) It clearly aims to form children’s identity through play. 
52. What does Mindi Reich-Shapiro emphasize in her comment on childhood education?
　　A) The importance of broadening children’s horizons.
　　B) The responsibilities of fathers for children’s growth.
　　C) The urgency of creating teacher education programs.
　　D) The role of teachers in motivating children to learn. 
53. What do we learn about male teachers from their responses in the study?
　　A) Some of them find it awkward when hugging children.
　　B) They feel pressured to keep up with female colleagues.
　　C) They find it hard to meet the expectations of kids’ parents.
　　D) Many of them feel prejudiced against socially and culturally. 
54. What is needed for men to commit to early childhood education?
　　A) Higher pay. 
　　B) Job security. 
　　C) Social recognition.
　　D) Better working conditions. 
55. What do the authors of the study recommend to bridge the gender gap in early childhood education?
　　A) Recruiting young men who have a passion for education young children.
　　B) Taking measures to attract prospective male teachers to work in the field.
　　C) Persuading prospective fathers to consider a change in their career.
　　D) Providing male teachers with more opportunities for advancement.

Section B
Why it matters that teens are reading less
A) 	Most of us spend much more time with digital media than we did a decade ago. But today’s teens have grown up with smartphones. Compared with teens a couple of decades ago, the way they interact with traditional media like books and movies is fundamentally different.
B) 	Analysis of surveys of over one million teens in the United States collected since 1976 reveals a major shift in how teens are spending their leisure time. Paper books are being ignored, in favor of screens. Digital devices are changing other behaviors, too. More and more, young people choose spending time on their electronic devices over engaging in other activities, regardless of the type. Indeed, by 2016, the average American high school senior said they spent six hours a day writing text messages, on social media, and online during their free time. And that covers just three activities, and if other digital media activities were included, that estimate would no doubt rise.
C) 	Teens did not always spend that much time with digital media. Online time has doubled since 2006, and social media use has moved from a periodic activity to a daily one in the same period. By 2016, nearly nine out of ten young women in the 12th grade said they visited social media sites every day. Meanwhile, time spent playing video games rose from under an hour a day to an hour and a half on average. One out of ten American 8th grade students in 2016 spent 40 hours a week or more playing video games. Let me emphasize that this is equal to the time most adults spend per week at work.
D) 	If teens are spending so much time using electronic devices, does that mean they have to give up some other activities? Maybe not. Over the years, many scholars have insisted that time online does not necessarily take away time spent engaging with traditional media or on other activities. Some people, they argue, are just more interested in certain kinds of media and entertainment. Thus, using more of one type of media does not necessarily mean less of the other.
E) 	That may be true, but that still does not tell us much about what happens across a whole generation of people when time spent on digital media grows. Large surveys conducted over the course of many years tell us that American youth are not going to the cinema nearly as often as they did in the past. While 70 percent of 8th and 10th grade students used to go to the movies once a month or more, now only about half do this. More and more, watching a movie is something teens choose to do on their electronic devices. Why is this a problem? One reason is that going to the cinema is generally a social activity. Now, watching movies is something that most teens do alone. This fits a larger pattern. In another analysis, researchers found that today’s teens go out with their friends much less often than previous generations did.
F) 	But the trends related to movies are less disturbing compared with the change in how teens spend their time. Research has revealed an enormous decline in reading. In 1980, about 60 percent of senior high school students said they read a book, newspaper or magazine every day that was not assigned for school. By 2016, only 16 percent did. This is a huge drop and it is important to note that this was not merely a decline in reading paper books, newspapers or magazines. The survey allowed for reading materials on a digital device.
G) 	Indeed, the number of senior high school students who said they had not read any books for pleasure in the last year was one out of three by 2016. That is triple the number from two decades ago. For today’s youth, books, newspapers and magazines have less and less of a presence in their daily lives. Of course, teens are still reading. But they are generally reading short texts. Most of them are not reading long articles or books that explore deep themes and require critical thinking and reflection. Perhaps not accidentally, in 2016 reading scores were the lowest they have ever been since 1972.
H) 	This might present problems for young people later on. When high school students go on to college, their past and current reading habits will influence their academic performance. Imagine going from reading texts as short as one or two sentences to trying to read entire books written in complex language and containing sophisticated ideas. Reading and comprehending longer books and chapters takes practice, and American teens are no longer getting that practice.
I) 	So how can this problem be solved? Should parents and teachers take away teens’ smartphones and replace them with paper books? Probably not. Research has shown that smartphones are currently American teens’ main form of social communication. This means that, without a smartphone, teens are likely to feel isolated from their peers. However, that does not mean teens need to use electronic devices as often as they do now. Data connecting excessive digital media time to mental health issues suggests a limit of two hours a day of free time spent with screens, a restriction that will also allow time for other activities—like going to the movies with friends or reading longer, more complicated texts.
J) 	The latter is especially important. I would argue that of all the changes brought about by the widespread use of digital devices, the huge decline in reading is likely to have the biggest negative impact on today’s teens because reading books and longer articles is one of the best ways to learn critical thinking. It helps people to understand complex issues and to separate fact from fiction. Thus, deep reading is crucial for being a good citizen, a successful college student and a productive employee. If serious reading dies, a lot will go with it. 
36. Many years’ surveys reveal that young people in America are going to the cinema much less often than they used to. 
37. Survey analysis shows American teens now spend their leisure time on digital devices rather than reading printed books. 
38. The number of senior high schoolers not reading books for pleasure in a year increased three times over 20 years. 
39. Many scholars claim that spending time on electronic devices doesn’t necessarily mean a decrease of time for other activities.
40. Most people spend much more time interacting with digital media than they did ten years ago. 
41. The author claims that it will be a great loss if we no longer read books and longer articles.
42. Over a decade or so, American teens’ social media use shifted from an occasional activity to a routine one.
43. A more disturbing trend in America today is that teens are spending far less time reading than around four decades ago. 
44. Some five years ago, high school seniors in America generally spent more than six hours a day on electronic devices. 
45. It was found that American youngsters today don’t socialize nearly as much as the earlier generations.
Section C
Passage One
　　Have you ever wondered how acceptable it is to hug or touch someone? While it may sound safe to avoid all physical contact so as not to offend anyone, the lack of touching might imply cold attitudes or indifference in interpersonal relationships.
　　So, what should we do? The simple answer is to thoroughly learn unique cultural norms for physical contact. In nonverbal communication terminology(术语), physical contact and the study of touching are generally referred to as haptics.
　　Haptics in communication often suggest the level of intimacy. They are usually classified into two groups: high-contact and low-contact.
　　Asia and quite surprisingly the United States, Canada and Britain belong to low-contact cultures.People from the rest of the world, such as Latin America, are considered to be in high-contact cultures, where they tend to expect touching in social interactions and feel more comfortable with physical closeness. Despite the classification, there are more complex factors such as relational closeness, gender, age, and context that can affect how someone views physical contact.
　　One common French custom of greetings is cheek-kissing, but it is mostly restricted to friends, close acquaintances and family members. While cheek-kissing for Latin Americans is also a universal greeting form, it does not require such a high degree of relational closeness. However, gender matters more for them because check-kissing often only happens between women or a man and a woman but not two men.
　　In contrast, in certain Arabian, African, and Asian countries, men can publicly hold hands or show physical affection as signs of brotherhood or friendship while these behaviors may suggest a romantic relationship in other parts of the world. Although men’s touching is more normal in these cultures, physical contact between persons of opposite sexes who are not family members is negatively perceived in Arabian countries.
　　These factors could definitely affect the degree to which someone is comfortable with tactile (触觉的) communication and physical intimacy. Therefore, if you are someone who loves to show physical affection, you should not be afraid to show it or drastically change your behaviors—just ask for consent beforehand!
46. What does the author say in the first paragraph about physical contact?
　　A) Its role in interpersonal relationships is getting increasingly important.
　　B) It is becoming more acceptable to many who used to think it offensive.
　　C) Its absence might suggest a lack of warmth in interpersonal relationships.
　　D) It might prompt different responses from people of different social backgrounds. 
47. What does physical contact in communication suggest?
　　A) What social class people belong to.
　　B) How civilized the communicators are.
　　C) What family background people come from.
　　D) How close the communicators’ relationships are. 
48. What do we learn about people in high-contact cultures?
　　A) They are sensitive to the way people express their emotions.
　　B) They take touching as a cultural norm in social interactions.
　　C) They attach great importance to close ties among people.
　　D) They tend to be more open in interpersonal relationships. 
49. What do we learn about social customs in Arabian countries?
　　A) Men can show friendship in public through physical affection.
　　B) Non-traditional romantic relationships are simply unacceptable.
　　C) Physical contact between unfamiliar people is negatively perceived.
　　D) People of different ages and genders show affection in different ways. 
50. What does the author tell us to do concerning tactile communication?
　　A) Lay emphasis on nonverbal communication.
　　B) Learn to use appropriate body language first.
　　C) Pay attention to the differences between genders.
　　D) Take other people’s preference into consideration.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　From climate change to the ongoing pandemic (大流行病) and beyond, the issues facing today’s world are increasingly complex and dynamic. Yet solving problems like these requires new approaches that extend beyond traditional ways of thinking. A study led by Yale Professor of Psychology, Paul O’Keefe, found that having a growth mindset (思维倾向) of interest may spark this type of innovation.
　　Professor O’Keefe established in earlier studies that people hold different beliefs about the nature of interest. Those with a growth mindset of interest tend to believe that interests can be developed and cultivated, while those with a fixed mindset of interest tend to believe that interests are inherent (与生俱有的) and simply need to be ’found.’ Building on these findings, the latest research examined how a growth mindset of interest can boost integrative thinking across the traditional disciplinary boundaries of arts and sciences.
　　For example, in one task, research participants were instructed to create new college majors by combining two or more existing academic Arts or Science programs at their university. After coding and analyzing the ideas they generated, the team found that people with a growth mindset of interest were more likely to bridge programs across the arts and sciences to create new majors like computational economics rather than creating majors that drew from only one of those areas, like computational chemistry.
　　As Professor O’Keefe pointed out, “This research provides a useful direction for organizations whose products and services call for integrated and creative solutions. Take smartphones for example. You need not only computer science and engineering knowledge, but also an understanding of psychology and visual design to create a better product. Employees with a growth mindset may be more likely to devise innovative ideas that bridge multiple areas of knowledge to achieve better solutions.” 
　　The benefits of a growth mindset of interest may also extend to those seeking employment. This is a pressing issue because many people are becoming unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Having a growth mindset of interest can help job seekers expand their interests and become more adaptable to different fields, and take the initiative to learn new skills. 
51. What does the author say about the world today?
　　A) It faces problems that are getting more varied and complicated.
　　B) It has done away with many of the traditional ways of thinking.
　　C) It is undergoing radical and profound changes.
　　D) It is witnessing various types of innovations. 
52. What did Professor O’Keefe find in his earlier studies?
　　A) People’s interests tend to change with age.
　　B) People’s interests determine their mindsets.
　　C) People are divided about the nature of interest.
　　D) People of different ages have different mindsets. 
53. What is the focus of Professor O’Keefe’s recent research?
　　A) How boundaries can be removed between arts and science disciplines.
　　B) How feasible it is to create new disciplines like computational economics.
　　C) How students in arts and sciences view the two types of mindset of interest.
　　D) How a growth mindset of interest can contribute to cross-disciplinary thinking. 
54. What does the author want to illustrate with the example of smartphones?
　　A) Hi-tech products are needed in interdisciplinary research.
　　B) Improved technology gives birth to highly popular products.
　　C) Making innovative products needs multidisciplinary knowledge.
　　D) Hi-tech products can boost people’s integrative thinking. 
55. What is the author’s suggestion to those who are seeking employment?
　　A) Learning practical skills.
　　B) Broadening their interests.
　　C) Staying safe in the pandemic.
　　D) Knowing their pressing issues.

Section A
Directions: In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word for each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage.

Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　　You might think of your teeth as tools, like built-in knives and forks, but if they are mere tools, why do they feel pain and wouldn’t it be better if they could just   26   under any condition? In spite of our   27   discomfort, it turns out there’s a good reason our teeth are so sensitive. Tooth pain is a   28   mechanism that ensures when a tooth is being damaged we’ll notice and do something about it.
　　　If we eat something too hot or too cold, or if the tooth is worn down enough where the tissue 	29   is exposed, all of those things cause pain, and then the pain causes the person not to use that tooth to try to protect it a little bit more. So it’s really a protective mechanism more than anything else. If teeth didn’t feel pain, we might   30   to use them in situations that damage them, and for humans, damaging  	31   teeth is a problem because, unlike crocodiles, we can’t   32	   them.
　　Teeth have three layers, only one of which-the innermost layer of the tooth-can hurt, as that layer of the tooth   		33   both blood vessels and nerves. Pain is the only feeling to which the nerves in that layer respond. Whereas people with tooth sensitivity may complain, for example, of tooth pain 	 34	   by heat or cold, the nerves in the inner layer don’t sense temperature. Rather, they feel pain, which may be   35   with, say, drinking something very cold.

How to determine if a company is a good fit for you 
A)	On paper, the job seemed perfect for me: The position was completely in line with my degree, the duties and responsibilities were compatible with my interests, and the office maintained a well-stocked kitchen that would satisfy my every snack desire.
B)	Sounds like my dream job, right? There was only one small problem: I simply didn’t get along with the company culture. They favored a more rigid, closed-door, corporate atmosphere, while I would have preferred something more collaborative and open. They were complete clock watchers, while I would have liked a more flexible schedule. To put it plainly, we just weren’t on the same page.
C) When it comes to looking for a new job, you already know that a big part of the interview process involves the company evaluating whether or not you’re a good fit for their open role. But, it’s important to keep in mind that the employer isn’t the only one who needs to identify a good match—you should be looking for that same exact thing. Company culture can have a big impact on how you feel about your work, so you want to make sure you sign an offer letter with an organization you’re truly excited about.
D)	However, figuring out what a company is like before you actually work there can be a bit of a challenge. Luckily, there are a few things you can do to determine whether or not a company is a good fit for you—before you ever sign your name on that dotted line.
E)	First of all, know what you want. It’s hard to make any decisions when you don’t really know what you’re looking for. So before you can determine whether you and a specific company would be compatible together, it’s important to have a solid handle on what exactly you want from your employer. Many of us have an easier time identifying the things that we absolutely don’t want. If those are the only things you can think of, don’t worry! That’s still a good place to start.
F)	Start by writing down the things you didn’t like about previous employers, as well as the parts you really valued. There’s no wrong answer here—so from big things to small details, write them all down on your list. This will help you immediately identify what you’re looking for in an organization, as well as the things you’re trying to stay far, far away from.
G) Make sure to do your research. Now comes the part when you put on your detective hat and do a little digging. The Internet will be your best friend when you’re trying to familiarize yourself with a company’s culture before ever walking through their office doors. And where exactly should you look for these culture clues? Start with the most obvious place first: the company’s website. Read through their copy and blog. Do they use formal, direct language? Or is it casual, conversational, and maybe even a little humorous? This can be a big indicator of what sort of atmosphere the company is trying to cultivate.
H)	Next, turn your attention toward their social media outlets. Are they sharing photos of their team’s Thursday afternoon barbeque or Halloween costume contest? Or are their social media accounts strictly reserved for company-related announcements and product launches?
I)	An industry review website like Glassdoor is another spot to check in order to find some insider information about what you can expect about a company. However, remember to take the reviews you read with a grain of salt-many of them are written by scorned (被鄙视的) employees.
J)	Finally, you can never fail with personal connections. Send a quick message to a current or previous company employee on LinkedIn or by email and ask if they would be willing to have a quick conversation with you about the organization in general. If you get a yes to your request for a chat, you’ll be armed with some pretty powerful and helpful information heading into your interview!
K) Learn more by asking questions. You know that part at the end of a job interview when the hiring manager asks if you have any questions, and you just stare across the table blankly with your mouth hanging open? That’s the perfect opportunity to speak up and get your burning company culture questions answered! So yes, you can definitely ask your interviewer about what it’s like to work for that particular organization. Simple questions like, “What three words would you use to describe the culture here?” or “What’s your favorite part about working for this company?” can reveal a lot about what it’s really like behind closed doors.
L) Prioritize your values. What does my dream company culture look like? Well, I could come and go as I please, as long as I was getting the work done. My boss would genuinely listen to and value all of my ideas arid suggestions. My co-workers would all be friendly with one another, without ever falling into the office gossip trap. The kitchen would have endless options of pizza and cookies. Oh, and they’d give me two months of paid vacation with a very generous salary.
M) What are my chances of finding all of those things with one employer? Slim to none—believe me, I’ve looked. This is why it’s so important to know which aspects of a company’s culture you value most. Is it an open communication style or a flexible schedule? Focus on the top spots on your priority list, and ensure a potential employer at least checks those boxes. Unfortunately, this is reality, you can’t have everything you want but a few are certainly achievable.
N)	When you’re hunting for a new job, you already know that the employer is trying to decide whether or not you’re a good fit for the position. But you should also look at the process through a similar lens. You may not be the one conducting the actual interview, but you’re still trying to determine whether or not the company is a good fit for you.
O)	Keep these tips in mind to figure out whether you and a potential employer are a perfect match or just a recipe (方案) for disaster. After all, it’s a good thing to know before actually accepting an offer.
36.	Clues about the culture of a company can be found on its website.
37.	It can be difficult to know the real situation in a company until you become part of it.
38.	It is impossible for a job applicant to have every expectation met.
39.	Simply by reading its description, the author found the job offered ideal.
40.	Job applicants are advised to make a written list of their likes and dislikes in their previous employment.
41.	At the end of an interview, a job applicant should seize the opportunity to get answers to their urgent questions.
42.	To begin with, job applicants should be clear what they expect from their future employer.
43.	Job applicants should read with a critical eye what is written about a company on the website.
44.	Job satisfaction has a lot to do with company culture.
45.	A chat with an insider of a company can give job applicants very useful information when they prepare for an interview.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Online classes began to be popularized just a few decades ago. They are advertised as a way for adults to finish their education and students to learn the material at their own pace—it is far more compatible for people with busy schedules.
　　　But after being enrolled in an online course last fall semester, I came to realize online classes were merely a means to fulfil course requirements.
　　　First of all, students lack the desire to learn, and they simply complete their assignments to receive credit for a passing grade rather than genuinely engage with the course material.
　　　As online courses tend to have more than 100 students, most of the assignments are short and simple. They are not designed for students to interact with the material in depth but designed to be graded easily to accommodate such a large number of students.
　　　Perhaps the biggest disadvantage of taking an online class is the absence of face-to-face interaction between the teacher and their students. Live sessions are infrequent and are often scheduled during the middle of the day when students have to attend other classes or work. The office hours of the professor may also be during inconvenient times for many students as well. Most interaction with the professor has to be through email which is often impersonal. It is nearly impossible for students to build a relationship with their professor.
　　　There is also little interaction amongst students. It can be harder for students to create study groups and form relationships with their peers.
　　　Online classes also require either a computer or laptop and a reliable internet connection. Not all students have access to these types of resources, whether it is for financial or other reasons, and some students can be put at a disadvantage.
　　　Offering online classes certainly helps students who would otherwise not be able to attend classroom sessions. However, they fail to provide a genuine education with an emphasis on convenience rather than critical thinking. We need restructured online classes in which students can have a learning experience that will actually provide quality education.
46. What does the author say about students enrolled in online classes?
　　A) They can access course materials easily.
　　B) They are unmotivated to learn.
　　C) They can learn at their own pace.
　　D) They rarely fulfil the course requirements.
47. What does the author think of online course assignments?	
　　A) They are made convenient to mark.
　　B) They are meant to facilitate interaction.
　　C) They are based on easily accessible material.
　　D) They are given to accommodate students’ needs.
48. What does the author say is one disadvantage of online classes?
　　A) They are frequently scheduled at irregular times.
　　B) They make professors’ offices much less accessible.
　　C) They tend to increase professors’ burden of responding to students’ emails.
　　D) They provide little chance for students to build relationships with each other.  
49. What problem may arise if classes go online?
　　A) More students may find it easy to be absent from them.
　　B) Teachers will worry about poor internet connections.
　　C) Some students may have difficulty attending them.
　　D) Schools with limited resources will be at a disadvantage.
50. What does the author think constitutes a key part of genuine education?
　　A) Acquisition of useful knowledge.	
　　B) Training of real-life skills on campus. 
　　C) Development of students’ personalities.
　　D) Cultivation of analytical thinking ability.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　In the age of the internet, there’s no such thing as a private debate. But is that bad for science? Some scientists have had concerns. When debates in any sector move beyond the halls of universities and government agencies, there’s potential for information to be used incorrectly, leading to public confusion; yet, open debate can also promote communication between the scientific community and the public. Recent open debates on scientific research, health, and policy have aroused greater public attention and encouraged more diverse voices. If this trend spurs scientists to agree more quickly about the best solutions to our problems-and at the same time helps the public observe the process of scientific discourse more clearly—then this is good for everyone, including scientists.
　　　A recent debate published in The New York Times discussed the question of how quickly medicine should be developed and produced. Issues such as safety of the product and perception of the public were examined and considered. But some experts worried that such public speculation might lead people to believe that disagreement about the details meant a lack of adequate scientific consensus over the safety and efficiency of modern-day medicine.
　　The anxiety seems misplaced. Gone are the days of going to a conference and debating scientific issues, and that’s good because those gatherings were not diverse enough and excluded many important voices. These days, the public can access debates about science regardless of where they take place.
　　For many scientists, public debate is a new frontier and it may feel like a place with few restraints or rules? but rather than avoiding such conversations, let the debates be transparent and vigorous, wherever they are held. If the public is to understand that science is an honorably self-correcting process, the idea that science is a fixed set of facts in a textbook needs to be dismissed. With the validity of science coming under attack, there’s a need for scientific debates to be perceived as open and true to life. Let everyone see the noisy, messy deliberations that advance science and lead to decisions that benefit us all.
51.What does the author think open debate can do?
　　A) Help the public to better understand science.
　　B) Clear up confusion in the scientific community.
　　C) Settle disputes between universities and government agencies.
　　D) Prevent information from being used incorrectly by the public.
52.Why did a recent debate published in The New York Times arouse concerns among experts?
　　A) It might hinder the progress in medical research.
　　B) It might breed public distrust in modern medicine.
　　C) It might add to the difficulty of getting research funds.
　　D) It might prevent medical scientists reaching consensus. 、
53.	Why does the author say some experts’ anxiety seems misplaced?
　　A) Debating scientific issues at a conference is now old-fashioned.
　　B) Diverse topics can be debated by both scientists and the public.
　　C) Debates about science are accessible to the public anyway.
　　D) Scientists can voice their opinions whatever way they like.
54.	What does the author suggest scientists do about public debate?
　　A) Have more discussions about it.	
　　B) Embrace it with open arms.
　　C) Formulate new rules for it.
　　D) Restrain it to a rational degree.
55.	What does the author say about science in the last paragraph?
　　A) It is transmitted through textbooks.	
　　B) It is what proves valid and true to life.
　　C) It is a dynamic and self-improving process.
　　D) It is a collection of facts and established rules.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　　If you’ve ever looked at the ingredients list while grocery shopping, chances are you’ve seen the term “natural flavors”. But have you taken a  	26	  to consider what these natural flavors actually are?
　　　Most of us might think that “natural flavors” are, well, naturally good for us. A recent study in the journal Appetite found that when the word “natural” appears on packaging, people  		27	  that the food within is indeed healthier. In truth, natural flavors do not   	28		 much, at least chemically speaking, from their flavor-boosting   29	  : artificial flavors. Both can be made in a lab by trained flavorists, but artificial flavors use chemicals to give a product a   30   smell or taste.
　　　Natural flavors come from plant or animal   31  , like fruit, vegetable, meat, fish or milk that is then processed or refined in some way. In short, natural flavors are   32   from plants and animals to create specific flavors for processed foods. But that does not   33   make it easier to tell what is really in your food. Because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not   34   the term, companies can use it to refer to pretty much anything derived from a plant or animal. And natural flavors can also include a variety of chemical additives, such as preservatives. The FDA doesn’t require companies to reveal what additional chemicals a specific item   35  .
　　　So if you want to know for certain what you’re getting with your groceries, you might want to stick to the farmer’s market.

Fake holiday villa websites prompt warning
A) During the British winter, the thought of two weeks in a coastal villa (别墅) with soul-stirring views of the sea and a huge pool to enjoy is enough to offset (抵消) the labor until the holidays start. For a growing number of people, however, their yearly break is turning into a nightmare as they find that the property they have paid thousands for does not exist and the website through which they booked it has disappeared.
B)	Consumers have been warned to be aware of the potential for deception in this market, which is far from uncommon. In 2017 there were 1,632 cases of reported “villa fraud (诈骗)”, with victims losing an average of £ 2,052, according to Action Fraud, the national center for reporting such frauds. “Millions of pounds are lost each year by defrauded holidaymakers,” says Sean Tipton of the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) .
C) The problem has ballooned in the last 10 years, with frauds becoming more and more sophisticated. The fake websites have authentic-sounding names involving a mix of keywords, typically including the place name,“summer”, “villas” or “rentals”. Details of legitimate (合法的) villas are often stolen from other sites. “When the fraudsters first started it was unsophisticated—the websites looked amateur and there wasn’t a lot of effort,” says Tipton. “Now they are clever. They extensively rip off legitimate websites and use a different website name. They’ll have pictures of a sales team and it might be a poor actor in New York that is down as their head of sales.”
D) Fraudsters target popular seaside destinations for British tourists visiting Spain where prices can soar if demand exceeds supply. Prices are kept within reasonable ranges to avoid arousing suspicion. “A villa might cost £ 5,000 elsewhere and they will offer it at say £ 3,500. But a bit of a giveaway is that the villa will be cheaper than on other websites and there’s unlimited availability,” says Tipton. Fraudsters also invest in pay-per-click advertising to feature at the top of search engines when people type in phrases such as “Spanish seaside villas”.
E) 	With such a degree of professionalism, how can consumers find out if the website they’re looking to book with is trustworthy? “When people book holiday villas they are doing so through rose-colored glasses,” says Tony Neate, chief executive of Get Safe Online, “They should be Googling the property, and looking on websites like Google Maps and StreetView to see if it’s there. Also, speak to the person you’re booking the villa with on a landline phone, as fraudsters tend to only use mobiles.” He also suggests asking someone not going on the holiday to have a look at the website. “They might spot problems you don’t spot.” Another potential red flag is being asked to pay by bank transfer. “The problem is that when the money leaves your account it’s in theirs straightaway and it’s very hard to track it,” says Barclays Bank head of digital safety, Jodie Gilbert. “We generally recommend other forms of payment, like credit card.”
F)	Little seems to be known about these fraudsters, “There is no way to definitely know who they are,” says Neate. “It could be anyone. It could be your next-door neighbor or organized crime in Russia.” Action Fraud says people should ensure the company renting the villa is a member of a recognized trade body such as ABTA.
G)	“By working with industry partners such as ABTA and Get Safe Online, we are able to issue alerts about the latest threats they should be aware of. If you believe you have fallen victim to fraud or cyber-crime, please report it to Action Fraud,” it adds. ABTA says it is trying to combat the issue by running public awareness campaigns. “It’s a growing problem and people can’t stop fraudsters being dishonest,” says Tipton. “They’re still going to do it. It’s not impossible to stop but as it’s internet-based it’s harder to pursue.”
H)	Nick Cooper, the founder and co-owner of villa booking company Villa Plus, estimates his company has uncovered more than 200 fake villa websites over the past two years, and doesn’t believe enough is being done. “It is hopeless to report fake villa websites to the internet giants who host them,” he says. “I found it impossible to speak to anyone. Also, once one bank account gets reported, they simply use another.”
I)	For now the only way to stop fraudsters appears ultimately to lie in the hands of the consumer. “When people book their holidays they get so emotionally involved, and when they find that villa at a good price with availability in peak season, they are an easy target,” says Cooper. “The public has to learn to be far more aware they are a target for these sort of frauds.” But it’s not just the financial cost. “A family will turn up at a villa and find out it doesn’t exist or the owner doesn’t know who you are,” says Tipton. “The problem then is you have to find accommodation at short notice. It can be incredibly expensive but it’s the emotional cost, too.”
J)	Carla O’Shaughnessy from Sydenham was searching last year for a good deal to book a villa in Majorca for a summer break for the family. “I was comparing prices online and found one that came in a bit cheaper than others,” says O’Shaughnessy. She emailed the company via its website, asking how far the villa was from the airport and about local restaurants. “They came back with believable answers; it was all very friendly and professional,” she says. Happy with the responses, O’Shaughnessy paid the full amount of £ 3,000 via bank transfer into the travel agent’s account and then forgot about it until a month before the booking.
K)	“I tried logging on to the website and couldn’t,” she recalls. “I Googled the agent’s name and there were lots of complaints about him being a fraudster. If only I’d Googled before but I never thought of it.” Although she found another villa in time for their holiday, she admits she was much more cautious. “I paid through a secure third-party site and had phone conversations with the agent. But I wasn’t able to relax until we turned up and I had the keys.”
36.	Fraudsters often steal villa-booking information from authentic holiday websites.
37.	Fraudsters keep changing their bank accounts to avoid being tracked.
38.	It is suggested that people not going on the holiday might help detect website frauds.
39.	More and more British holidaymakers find the seaside villas they booked online actually nonexistent. 
40. By checking an agent’s name online before booking a villa, holidaymakers can avoid falling into traps. 
41. Fraudsters are difficult to identify, according to an online safety expert.
42.	Holidaymakers have been alerted to the frequent occurrence of online villa-booking frauds.
43.	It is holidaymakers that can protect themselves from falling victim to frauds.
44.	Holidaymakers are advised not to make payments by bank transfer.
45.	Fraudsters advertise their villas at reasonable prices so as not to be suspected.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Social media can be a powerful communication tool for employees, helping them to collaborate, share ideas and solve problems. Research has shown that 82% of employees think social media can improve work relationships and 60% believe it can support decision-making processes. These beliefs contribute to a majority of workers connecting with colleagues on social media, even during work hours.
　　　Employers typically worry that social media is a productivity killer; more than half of U.S. employers reportedly block access to social media at work. In my research with 277 employees of a healthcare organization I found these concerns to be misguided. Social media doesn’t reduce productivity nearly as much as it kills employee retention.
　　　In the first part of the study I surveyed the employees about why and how they used platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Respondents were then asked about their work behaviors, including whether they felt motivated in their jobs and showed initiative at work. I found employees who engage in online social interactions with co-workers through social media blogs tend to be more motivated and come up with innovative ideas. But when employees interact with individuals outside the organization, they are less motivated and show less initiative.
　　　In the second part of the study I found 76% of employees using social media for work took an interest in other organizations they found on social media. When I examined how respondents expressed openness to new careers and employers, I found that they engaged in some key activities including researching new organizations and making new work connections.
　　　These findings present a dilemma for managers: employees using social media at work are more engaged and more productive, but they are also more likely to leave your company. Managers should implement solutions that neutralize the retention risk caused by social media.
　　　They can create social media groups in which employees will be more likely to collaborate and less likely to share withdrawal intentions or discussions about external job opportunities. Managers can also use social media to directly reduce turnover (跳槽) intentions, by recognizing employees’ accomplishments and giving visibility to employees’ success stories.
46.	What does previous research about social media reveal?
　　A) Most employees think positively of it.
　　B) It improves employees’ work efficiency.
　　C) It enables employees to form connections.
　　D) Employees spend much of their work time on it.
47.	What did the author’s own research find about social media?
　　A) It influences employees’ work negatively.	
　　B) It does much harm to employee loyalty.	
　　C) It kills employees’ motivation for work.
　　D) It affects employers’ decision-making.
48.	What did the author find in his study about the effect of online social interactions?
　　A) It differs from employee to employee.
　　B) It tends to vary with the platform used.
　　C) It has much to do with whom employees interact with.
　　D) It is hard to measure when employees interact with outsiders.
49.	What problem was found with employees using social media for work?
　　A) They seldom expressed their inner thoughts.
　　B) Most of them explored new job opportunities.
　　C) They were reluctant to collaborate with others.
　　D) Many of them ended with lower productivity.
50.	What does the author suggest managers do to neutralize the retention risk?
　　A) Give promotions to employees for their accomplishments.

　　D) Encourage employees to increase their visibility on social media.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　In the coming era of budget cuts to education, distance learning could become the norm.
　　　The temptation for those in charge of education budgets to trade teachers for technology could be so strong that they ignore the disadvantages of distance learning. School facilities are expensive to build and maintain, and teachers are expensive to employ. Online classes do not require buildings and each class can host hundreds of people simultaneously, resulting in greater savings, thus increasing the temptation of distance education for those concerned more about budgets than learning. But moving away from a traditional classroom in which a living, breathing human being teaches and interacts with students daily would be a disaster. Physically attending school has hidden benefits: getting up every morning, interacting with peers, and building relationships with teachers are essential skills to cultivate in young people. Moreover, schools should be more than simple institutions of traditional learning. They are now places that provide meals. They are places where students receive counseling and other support.
　　　Those policy-makers are often fascinated by the latest technology in education and its potential to “transform” education overnight. But online education does not allow a teacher to keep a struggling student after class and offer help. Educational videos may deliver academic content, but they are unable to make eye contact or assess a student’s level of engagement. Distance education will never match the personal teaching in a traditional classroom. In their first 18 years of life, American children spend only 9% of their time in school. Yet teachers are expected to prepare them to be responsible citizens, cultivate their social skills, encourage successful time management, and enhance their capacity to flourish in an increasingly harsh labor market. Given these expectations, schools should not become permanently “remote”.
　　　The power of the classroom is rooted in the humanity of the people gathered in the same place, at the same time. Personal teaching is about teachers showing students a higher path, and about young people going through the process together. Technology, no matter how advanced, should simply be a tool of a good teacher.
51.	What mainly accounts for the possibility that distance learning could become the norm?
　　A) Advances in education technology.	
　　B) Shrinking financial resources.	
　　C) Shortage of school facilities.
　　D) Lack of qualified teachers.
52.	What does the author say is one possible benefit of students attending school physically?
　　A) Developing the habit of getting up early.
　　B) Eating nutritionally well-balanced meals.
　　C) Growing into living and breathing human beings.
　　D) Cultivating relationships with peers and teachers.
53.	What does the author think of the latest technology in education?
　　A) It may have potential disadvantages.
　　B) It may render many teachers jobless.
　　C) It may add to students’ financial burden.
　　D) It may revolutionize classroom teaching.
54.	What does the author say teachers are expected to do?
　　A) Enhance students’ leadership capacity.
　　B) Elevate students to managerial positions.
　　C) Enable students to adapt to the changes in life.
　　D) Prepare students to be competitive in the future.
55.	Why couldn’t technology replace a good teacher?
　　A) It lacks humanity.	
　　B) It is still immature.	
　　C) It cannot track students’ growth.
　　D) It cannot cater to personal needs.

Public perception of success in the U.S.might be totally misguided.
　　　While  92%  of people believe  others  care most  about  fame  and   26  ,fewer   than 10%  factor  those  qualities  into  their  own  success.  This  is  according  to  the  newly 27
study by Harvard  Graduate  School  of Education professor  Todd  Smith.Smith  says he was 28     by  how  past  studies  on  success“assumed  what  people  will  care  about.”In  this study,  his  team“went  the    29  direction”by   spending   years   carrying   out   individual
interviews  and  group  surveys  to  see  what  people  really  talk  about  when  they  talk  about
success.
　　　As  a  scientist,  Smith   30   studied  individuality  for  a  living,  and  even  he  was surprised  to  find  younger  respondents  cared  more  about  having  a    31  in   life.   Those between  the  ages  of  18  and  34  prioritized  it  most,  and  that  prioritization  dropped  off as respondents'  ages  went up.  Perhaps  this  is because  older people  had  fewer  options  when  they were starting their careers, at a time when values focused more on stable incomes than  	32   .personal   missions.
　　　Other  trends  included  an  emphasis  on  the  importance  of parenting.  Being  a  parent 	33   very  high  across  the  priorities  of all  study  participants.  Ultimately,  Smith  hopes institutions will take note of these insights     34.
　　　Higher education institutions tend to focus on preparing students for high-paying jobs.  For such institutions, from universities to workplaces, to better   35   people  in  the  U.S., they'll need to understand“what the American public highly prioritizes,”Smith  says.

Each paragraph is marked with a letter:Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on

How a rabbit study and an ex-student boost my hopes for a future of'love and dignity'
A)At whatever grade level teachers find themselves, from kindergarten to the final class at medical  or  law  school,  few  moments  stir  the  emotions  as  deeply  as  when  former students reappear years and often decades later with an update on where their journey has taken them and what resiliencies(韧性)have been the pavement on which they've traveled.
B)So it was when a recent letter  came from Kelli Harding, a student 21 years ago in my  Peace Studies summer course in Washington. The weekly tuition-free class, in a roomy   space  that  Ralph  Nader  and  his  Public  Citizen  nonprofit  group  provided,  was   discussion-based and required no useless homework or exams. Just come in and figure  out how to increase peace  and decrease violence. And do it today, tomorrow is too late. The course attracted mostly congressional interns(实习生),with a few exceptions like  Kelli who was in Washington as an AmeriCorps volunteer.
C)Her year-long  service  included  comforting AIDs patients  at  a  free health  clinic  and  delivering meals to the homebound. It was a world apart from her undergraduate days at  the University of  California-Berkeley majoring in political science. The Washington experience,which Kelli would later call“transformative”, was the fuel that carried her  into medicine to earn a master's degree in public health from Columbia University and  a medical degree from the University of Rochester, and almost two decades of practice as an emergency-room psychiatrist(精神科医生)at New York-Presbyterian Hospital and a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.
D)Kelli's letter, a literate update on both her personal and professional life,touched my heart, and especially so when saying that two decades later she still has the course text, “Solutions to Violence,”and that“it remains one of my favorite possessions.”She lives in Lower Manhattan with her husband, Padraic,whom she met on a flight to London, and their three boys.
E)If Kelli  stands  out,  it's because  she  is  also  a  gifted writer.  Last month,Atria  Books published her book The Rabbit Effect:Live Longer, Happier, and Healthier with the Groundbreaking Science of Kindness.
F)With a blending of free-flowing confessional prose and scholarly research found in 461 notes, Kelli met my expectations that her ideas and ideals would be sound and singular. “Despite our scientific progress,”she writes,“Americans are remarkably unhealthy. In 2016,the United States ranked forty-third in the world for life expectancy. It is also by far the world's most expensive place to get sick.”
G)Enter the rabbits-not those running around in  our woodlands but ones serving in two month-long medical experiments to test the effects of eating a high-fat diet and the  connections between cholesterol and heart disease. With similar diets, the expectations

2022年9月英语四级真题1套 第 5 页 共 1 0 页 by: 光速考研

were that all the rabbits would have similar cloggings of their arteries(动脉堵塞).Yet one group had 60% fewer of them.
H)The reason? Instead of receiving the standard care given to lab animals,the 60% group was watched over by a newcomer to the lab who, Kelli writes,“handled the animals differently. When she fed her rabbits she talked to them and petted them. She didn't just pass out food, she gave them love. The studies indicate something is missing in the traditional biomedical model. It wasn't diet or genetics that made a difference in which rabbits got sick and which stayed healthy. It was kindness.”
I)   Amid the political  noise  about  Obamacare,Medicare,Medicaid,  health  insurance  and thieving pharmaceutical( 医 药 的 )companies,Kelli Harding stands apart from the crowd calling for quick fixes, the simpler the better.She has walked too many miles in  the halls of hospitals visiting too many far-gone patients and seeing too many medical  mistakes to go along with conventional thinking.
J)“The rabbit effect,”she explains, means that“when it comes to our health, we've been missing  some  crucial  pieces:hidden  factors  behind  what  really  makes  us  healthy. Factors like  love, friendship, and dignity. The designs of our neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces. There's a social dimension to health that we've completely overlooked  in our efforts to find the best and most cutting-edge medical care … Ultimately,what  affects our health in the most meaningful ways has more to do with how we treat one another, how we live, and how we think about what it means to be human than with  anything that happens in the doctor's office.”
K)In more than a few passages, she relates the stories of men and women who came up against assembly- line medicine where patients were treated mostly as pieces of flesh. “Clinically,”she writes,“it's common to see two patients with the same condition, such  as recovering from a heart attack, have two very different courses based on seemingly  irrelevant factors, such as their family relationships or their educational levels.  In my practice,the  sickest  people  I  see  often  share  similar  backgrounds:loneliness,  abuse, poverty, or discrimination. For them, the medical model isn't enough. It's like fixing up  an airplane engine and ignoring that the pilot is on his third drink at the bar and a massive storm is overhead … To properly care for patients, we also need to care about the lives of the people getting the care.”
L)Kelli  wastes  no time taking potshots at(随意批评)the medical establishment and its  body-centered  biomedicine  methods.  Instead,  she  remains  positive,holding  up  for  praise one  of her medical  school professors,George Engel,“who  always noticed not just  a patient's  physical condition but little details about her life,such as if she had family pictures up in her hospital room or flowers delivered. He was the kind of trusted  doctor you'd feel relieved to see and welcome into the room with a sick family member.  He'd sit down to talk with the patient not just about medical problems, but about her  life and priorities. He built a large consultation service to address the holistic(整体的) needs of hospitalized patients, including psychological and social factors.”

M)It's a guess how many George Engels in their white jackets are at work these days and another speculation on the number of Kelli Hardings the nation is blessed with. May the
totals be large and getting larger.

Section       C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions  or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B),C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage  One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Academic   dishonesty   is   nothing   new.   As   long   as   there   have   been   homework  assignments  and tests,there have been  cheaters.  The way  that  cheating  looks has  changed  over time, though, particularly now that technology has made it easier than ever.A study by  the Josephson Institute of Ethics interviewed 23,000 high school students and asked them a  variety of questions about academic ethics. Of the teens surveyed, 51 percent said that they  had knowingly cheated at some point on an exam but that they did not feel uneasy about the  behaviour.A  Common  Sense  Media  survey  found  that  35 percent  of students had  cheated via  smartphone, though the parents  surveyed  in that particular  study  did not believe their  kids had ever cheated. In many cases, students did not realize that strategies like looking up answers on a smartphone were actually cheating at all.
　　　In  today's  classrooms,  students  who  cheat  are  rarely  caught.  There  are  no  formulas written on the insides of hands or students looking across the aisle, or whispering answers to their classmates. Today's students use smartphones, tablets or even in-class computers to aid  their  cheating  attempts  and  leave  no  trace  of  their  crimes.  Since  cheating  through technology  is  not  listed  specifically  as  being  against  the  rules  in  many  school  policies,
students do not view the actions unethical.

2022年9月英语四级真题1套 第 7 页 共 1 0 页 by: 光速考研

　　　The technology is being adopted so quickly that school districts cannot adequately keep up with  cheating policies,or  even  awareness  campaigns that  alert  students to the problem with using  technology  to  find  answers  in  a  certain way.  From  a young  age, students learn that answers exist conveniently at their fingertips through search engines and expert websites.
　　　Schools must develop anti-cheating policies that include technology and these policies must be updated consistently. Teachers must stay  on guard when it comes to what their students are doing in classrooms and how technology could be playing a negative role in the learning process. Parents must also talk to their kids about the appropriate ways to find
academic answers and alert them to unethical behaviours that may seem innocent in their
own eyes.

46.What do we learn from the study by the Josephson Institute of Ethics?
A)Over half of the students interviewed were unaware they were cheating.  B)Cheating was becoming a way of life for a majority of high school teens. C) More than half of the interviewees felt no sense of guilt over cheating.
D)Cheating was getting more and more difficult for high school students.

47.What did the Common Sense Media survey reveal?
A) Most parents tended to overprotect their children.
B) Many students committed cheating unknowingly.
C) Students were in urgent need of ethical education.
D) Parents and kids had conflicting ideas over cheating.

48.Why do students rarely get caught cheating nowadays?
A)They copy formulas on their palms.
B) They help each other to cover up their acts.
C) They keep changing their ways of cheating.
D) They make use of modern technology.

49. What does the author think schools should do to tackle cheating?
A) Bring policies against cheating up to date. B)Reform their exam methods constantly.
C) Take advantage of the latest technologies.
D) Alert parents to their children's behaviour.

50.What does the author suggest teachers do in the classroom?
A) Prevent students from overusing electronic devices.
B) Develop more effective anti-cheating strategies.
C) Find more ways to curb students'unethical acts.
D)Guard against students'misuse of technology.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Remote  work   is   about  more   than  just  working   from  home—it  means  working  differently.   Organizations   should   reconsider   the   appropriateness   of  their   performance  evaluation  procedures  in  light  of the  shift  to  remote   work.This   requires  a  fundamental rethinking  of what  organizations  expect  from  employees  and what  companies would  look  for in a model employee in a remote work context.
　　　It is likely that the“first to arrive and last to leave”mentality is no longer relevant, but should  be  replaced  by  a  regard  for  the  quality  of  an  employee's  contribution  to  the organization. This means that work should be measured in terms of the quality of the work, not just the quality of the process. As remote work is largely unobservable to supervisors, employers need to think about how they can objectively measure the quality of work in a way that is consistent for employees of similar rank.
　　　Focusing  on  output  alone  can  have  the  unintended  consequences.  Employers  should think  instead  about  the  values  and  soft  skills  they  want  to  emphasize  in  a  remote  work environment.  Qualities  like  flexibility  and  the  ability  to  work  under  minimal  supervision might become critical. Much has been written about the importance of timely feedback. In the context of a global pandemic(大流行病),firms may want to provide additional support to  employees  by  providing  more  frequent  communication.  This  allows  managers  to  both keep an eye on struggling employees and provide ongoing feedback on how employees are adapting to their new work environment.
　　　Compensation  also  needs  to  be  revisited.  The  purpose  of  performance  evaluation  is ultimately  to  determine  how  to  reward  employees  for  their  work.  This  means  that  pay   structures need to adapt to the reality of working from home. However, organizations also   need to be honest with employees about the financial impact of COVID- 19.
　　　For  organizations that have  struggled to keep the  lights  on  due to the pandemic,this  might  mean  thinking  of non-financial  ways  to reward  employees,  like  unpaid  time  off or flexible  work  schedules.  Employers  can  also  consider  how  to  bundle  different  types  of
compensation to help employees cope with their unique situations.

51.What does the author say companies should do in the context of remote work? A)Reform  performance  evaluation.
B) Rethink the organizational fundamentals.
C) Reexamine its effects on employees' behaviors.
D)Reflect on its differences from working in the office.

52.What  should be prioritized  in  assessing  employees'remote work?

Section       B
Directions: In this section,you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it.  Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter: Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on
Answer Sheet 2.
The hidden costs colleges don't want you to know about
A)	This  fall,  thousands  of  college  students  from  across  the  country  will  begin  their undergraduate studies at colleges around the nation. They will inevitably pack too much  to fit in their tiny dorm rooms. They will also carry with them a huge student loan debt, in addition to countless“hidden”out-of-pocket costs paid for by their bank accounts and the bank accounts of their families.
B)	At my well-respected, private, four-year university in Washington, D.C., which boasts a  yearly tuition of $44,046 not including room and board, I receive over $57,000 yearly in financial aid. As a student from a family that is struggling to make ends meet, my financial  aid  package  is  a  combination  of federal  grants  and  federal  work  study, university  merit  scholarships  and  financial  aid  awards,  and  about  $8,000  yearly  in federally subsidized(有补贴的)and unsubsidized loans.On paper, my expenses and my financial aid just about even out. Off paper, they don't.
C)	Universities today are in the business of making money, and mine is no exception. They  hit me right out of gate with a $160 fee to attend my freshman orientation, a price which  does not include the cost of travel to and from the District. Almost every class has an  associated fee not included in the cost of tuition, most between $40 and $100.Fees for  lab science classes are the highest, and all students at my university are required to take  at least one lab before they graduate. Buying a laptop proved a necessity and, thankfully, a relative bought me one as a gift. Renting a mini-fridge for my dorm room costs my  roommates and me about $140 a year.
D)	Schools will  charge you whatever they  can.  The  costs  of any  damage to the  dorm, including elevators, bathrooms, and common areas, are billed to every person on a dorm floor, or even the entire building if they do not know who caused the damage. After I fell out of my bed twice during my freshman year, the university installed a railing—for $20, billed to my student account.My financial aid did not anticipate any of these costs,
and so it did not cover them.
E)	An   Internet   search   of“hidden   costs”of  college   turns   up   a   host   of  articles   on parent-centered websites on the college application process. These articles are almost
always geared towards upper- and middle-class families. For students already struggling to pay tuition, these costs may be the least of their worries.
F)	So what hidden costs  should low-income  students really be paying attention to? My college experience offers a few examples.
G) If you are a low-income student who will be attending school out-of-state, make sure 2022年12月英语四级真题第1套第5页共10页 by: 光速考研

you  know  if  you  can  use  your  state  benefits,such  as  the   Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance  Program,or  SNAP.It  wasn't  until  after  I  had  accepted  admission  to  an out-of-state school that I learned that I could not use my Ohio Medicaid on campus for anything  other than  emergency  care.  My benefits became  invalid the  second  I moved  out of Ohio. After my freshman year, I had to opt for the school's insurance plan, which  costs  around  $2,000  a  year.Even  if your  school  offers  a  flat-rate  fee  for  a  doctor's appointment  at the  student health  center  (mine is  $20  a visit), these  fees  often  do not include extra fees for lab tests or prescription medications (药物).
H)	If you plan on paying off bills in your student account with a credit card, be aware of any additional costs. My school charges an additional fee for the use of a credit card to settle outstanding charges, which can add upwards of 3% of the balance to your bill.
I) There is another depressing reality hidden within even the largest financial aid packages:  Colleges  often  offer  the  most  generous  packages  during  freshman  year  as  a  way  to   attract new  students. My  family was  careful to  ask  about the  chances  of financial  aid    being taken away after my freshman year. We were assured that, except for low grades   or  a  raise  in  family  income,no  money  would  be  taken  away.  We  did  not  know  to   ask—and the  school  did not readily point  out—that  even  if tuition rises, my  financial   aid package will stay the same. So when my university  voted to raise tuition costs 3% at the end of my  freshman year, my  financial aid package remained the  same and I was   suddenly   responsible   for   an   additional   $1,200   for   the   next   year.   The   university   administration will  likely vote to raise costs at least once more before my graduation.
J) Yes, I chose to attend an expensive university far from my hometown. Yes, there were cheaper  options.  But  there  are  promising  students  from  struggling  families  across  the nation who should not rule out their dream schools entirely. All things considered, I am paying   significantly   less   than   the   ticket   price   of  my   university,   and   having   an educational  experience  in  Washington,  D.C.,that  I  would  not  have  had  anywhere  else. As a low-income student from a down-and-out Rust Belt community, these educational experiences have enormous potential to brighten my future-and my family's future.
K)The  key  is  to  make  sure  that  students  and  their  families  understand  that  hidden  costs exist,  and  that  they  may  prove  problematic.  Fill  out  a  more  comprehensive  checklist, and  be  wary  of listed  prices  that  seem  too  low.Understand just  how  complicated  the financial aid process is.
L)	Students  and  families  must  also  understand  their  ability  to  self-advocate.  They  should  not pay student bills or excess fees blindly. If something does not look right, ask about it. If it still doesn't look right, negotiate it. In cases where parents are working multiple  jobs,are    less    knowledgeable  about  college bureaucracies,have limited English  language skills, or are not contributing financially to their child's education, the burden of self-advocacy   will   fall   on   the   student.   I   understand   the   difficulty, and  the  embarrassment. But it is necessary.
M) In the grand scheme of things, however, colleges also must come to understand that the 2022年12月英语四级真题第1套第6页共10页 by: 光速考研

hidden fees they ask for may prove unmanageable for the very kinds of low-income or
first-generation students they are trying desperately to attract.
36.Students'financial  aid  remains  unchanged  even when tuition rises.
37.Students  may  not be able to enjoy their state benefits when they go to college out of the
state.
38. The financial aid the author receives is supposed to cover all her college expenses.
39.When  the  person  who damages  dorm facilities is not identified, students are required to
share the cost.
40.Though it is difficult and embarrassing, students should make inquiries about what fees
they have to pay and why.
41.Today,  many  Americans have to go to college on student loans
42.Receiving  education  in  a  private  university  in  the  nation's  capital  may  change  the
author's future life and that of her family's.
43.Students may no longer be qualified for financial aid if they perform poorly in school  or
if their family income has increased.
44.In  addition  to tuition, college students have to pay extra fees for the courses they take.
45.Some  schools  charge  students  a  fee  to  their  student  accounts  for using  credit  cards  to
pay bills.

Section     C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each  of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　To   write   his   2010   book,The   5-Factor   World   Diet,nutritionist   Harley   Pasternak    traveled to the healthiest  countries  around the world to learn more  about what made their meals extra nourishing.
He noted that Japanese people ate a wonderful variety of seaweeds, and that Chinese
people  tried  to  include  at  least  five  different  colors  in  every  meal.  Pasternak  also  came away with some valuable observations about how different the North American way of life  was, compared with many other countries.
　　For  starters, Americans  eat much bigger portions than people  in  other  countries.“We    don't  prioritize  eating  seasonally  or  locally,  and  we  also  add  lots  of  salt,sugar     and thickening   agents   to  our    foods,”explained   Pasternak.    Contrast   that   to  the   healthy  Mediterranean,  Nordic  and  Okinawan  diets  listed  in  Pasternak's  book.  They  all  seem  to stick to the ethos(特质)of regional, seasonal produce.
　　For example, a traditional Mediterranean diet includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains,    nuts and olive oil as the main components of nutritional  intake. Fish, chicken and  red wine
2022年12月英语四级真题第1套第7页共10页 by: 光速考研

make moderate appearances, while red meat, salt and sugar are used much less often. The benefits  of  a  traditional  Mediterranean  diet  have  been  studied  since  the  1970s,  and researchers have found that living that olive oil life can help people lose weight, lower their
heart disease risk and reverse diabetes.
　　　Most other healthy eating cultures also make meals an event—say, multiple courses around the family table, or a glass or two of red wine at a long lunch-as opposed to hastily  wolfing down handfuls of cereal above the kitchen sink and calling it dinner.
　　　Each of the healthy eating cultures has its own unique feature. But Pasternak did take note  of  one  unifying  factor  in  all  of  the  healthy  societies  he  observed.“The  only  overlapping feature in most of these healthy countries is that they all walk way more than  the  average  American,”said  Pasternak,“So  really,  regardless  of  what  you're  eating,if someone's walking four miles more than you each day, they're going to be a lot thinner and  live a lot longer than you.”

46.    What    characterizes    Japanese    and    Chinese    foods?
A)Variety.
B)Flavor.
C) Color.
D)Naturalness.

47. What is typical of Americans in the way of eating?
A) They emphasize nutrition.
B) They tend to eat quite a lot.
C) They prioritize convenience.
D) They care about flavors.
48.What features in Mediterranean, Nordic and Okinawan diets?
A)Fruits and vegetables.
B)Olive oil and red wine.
C)Seasonal local produce.
D) Unprocessed ingredients.
49.What do people in most healthy eating cultures have in common?
A) They get the whole family to eat at a table.
B) They eat their meals regularly and punctually.
C) They consume plenty of cereal for breakfast.
D)They attach great importance to their meals.

50.Compared with the average American, people in healthy societies               
A) walk at least 4 miles a day
B) do considerably more walking
C)pay more attention to body shape
D) consume a lot more organic food

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Recognizing when a friend or colleague feels sad, angry or surprised is key to getting along with others. But a new study suggests that being sensitive to people's feelings may sometimes  come  with  an  extra  dose  of stress.  This  and  other  research  challenge  the prevailing view that emotional intelligence is uniformly beneficial to its bearer.
　　　In a study, psychologist Myriam Bechtoldt of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management  in  Germany  asked  166  male  university  students  a  series  of questions  to measure their emotional intelligence. For example, they showed the students photographs of people's faces and asked them to what extent feelings such as happiness or disgust were being expressed. The students then had to give job talks in front of judges who displayed serious facial expressions. The scientists measured concentrations of stress hormones in the students'saliva(唾液) before and after the talk.
　　　In students who were rated more emotionally intelligent, the stress measures increased more during the experiment and took longer to go back to baseline. The findings suggest that  some  people  may  be  too  emotionally  clever  for  their  own  good,  says  Bechtoldt. “Sometimes you can be so good at something that it causes trouble,”she notes.
　　　Indeed,the  study  adds  to  previous  research  hinting  at  a  dark  side  of  emotional intelligence.A study published in 2002 in Personality and Individual Differences suggested that  emotionally  perceptive  people  might  be  particularly  influenced  by  feelings  of depression  and  hopelessness.  Furthermore,several  studies  have  implied  that  emotional intelligence can be used to manipulate others for personal gains.
　　　More  research  is  needed  to  see  how  exactly  the  relation  between  emotional intelligence  and  stress  would play  out  in  women  and  in people  of different  ages  and  education levels. Nevertheless, emotional intelligence is  a useful skill to have, as long as you learn to also properly cope with emotions—both others' and your own, says Bechtoldt. For  example,some  sensitive  individuals  may  assume  responsibility  for  other  people's sadness or anger, which ultimately stresses them out. Remember, as Bechtoldt says,“you  are not responsible for how other people feel.”

51.What is the finding of the new study?
A)Emotional intelligence helps people get along with others.
B)Emotional intelligence is generally beneficial to its bearer.
C) People who are aware of others' feelings may experience more stress.   D)People who are emotionally stressed may have trouble making friends.

52.What was the purpose of psychologist Myriam Bechtoldt's experiment?
A)To define different types of human feelings.
B) To assess the impacts of being emotionally clever.
C) To demonstrate how to distinguish different feelings.

D)  To  identify  gender  differences  in  emotional  intelligence.

53.What  does  the  finding  of  Myriam  Bechtoldt's  study  indicate?
A)Greater  emotional  cleverness  means  less  trouble  in  one's  life.
B)  Emotional  intelligence  helps  people  succeed  in job  interviews.
C)  People's  psychological  wellbeing  is  related  to  various  factors.
D)People  may  suffer  from  having  a  high  emotional  intelligence.

A)People  suffering  from  depression  are  emotionally  immature.
B) People who look at the dark side of life often feel depressed.
C)  Some people may take  advantage  of it  and benefit themselves.
D)Some  people  may  lack  it  and  are  easily  manipulated  by  others.

A)Avoid   burdening   themselves   with   others'feelings.
B)  Rid  themselves  of worries  over  worldly  affairs.
C)  Learn  to  cope  with  people's  negative  feelings.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　　Parenting brings fathers more joy than it does mothers, according to a new study. The research  examined  three  studies   26   more  than  18,000  participants.  Across  all  three, parenthood   was   27   with   more positive wellbeing outcomes for dads than for mums.
　　　So why are fathers happier than mothers?“Fathers may fare better than mothers in part due to how they spend time with their children,”said lead author Katherine Nelson-Coffey. In   one   study,  the   authors    28    that   dads   were   more   likely   to   take“playing”as an     29   activity  both  when  caring  for  their  kids  and  spending  time  with  their  kids “Playing  with  their  children  likely  offers  parents  opportunities  to  experience  positive feelings   and   30   closeness  with  their  children,”they  say.
　　　Fathers   also   did   better   than   men   without   kids,   reporting   greater   happiness,life satisfaction,  and  fewer    31  symptoms.They  also  reported  greater  connectedness  and autonomy (自主).For   mums,  32   ,compared  to  women  without  children,  the  results weren't  quite  as  positive.Mums  reported  greater  autonomy,  but  also“greater  trouble”and fewer   positive   33   .
　　　Mums  reported  happier  moods  while  interacting  with  their  kids,  compared  to  other  experiences,  but  not  while  engaging   34  in   childcare.“This   difference   suggests   that  how mothers  and  fathers  spend time with their  children might have  important   35  for    their  wellbeing,”the  authors  write.  They  suspect  that  mums  may  be  less  happy  than  dads because they're more likely to have higher expectations about parenthood. As such, they're  more likely to be “let down”by the experience.

Section       B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given  in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph  from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each  paragraph is marked with a letter: Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Learning to say no
A)	Not doing something will always be faster than doing it. This philosophy applies in many areas of life. For example, there is no meeting that goes faster than not having a meeting at all. This is not to say you should never attend another meeting, but the truth is that we say“yes”to too many things we don't actually want to do.
B)	How often do people ask you to do something and you just reply,“Sure.”Three days   later, you're overwhelmed by how much is on your to-do list. We become frustrated by  our obligations even though we were the ones who said “yes”to them in the first place.  Even worse, people will occasionally fight to do things that waste time. You don't have to do something just because it exists. It's worth asking if things are necessary. Many of  them are not, and a simple  ‘no"will be more productive than whatever work the most efficient person can cope with. But if the benefits of saying“no”are so obvious,then  why do we   say“yes”so often?
C)	We say“yes”to many requests not because we want to do them, but because we don't  	want  to  be  seen  as  rude  or  unhelpful.  Often,  we  have  to  consider  saying“no”to  	someone we will interact with again in the future—our co-worker, our  spouse, our  	family and friends.Saying“no”to our superiors at work can be particularly difficult. In  	these situations, I like the approach recommended in Essentialism by Greg McKeown.  	He writes,“Remind your superiors what you would be neglecting if you said 'yes'and  	force them to deal with the trade-off. For example, if your manager comes to you and  	asks you to do  X,  you  can  respond  with‘Yes,  I'm  happy  to  make this the priority. 	Which of these other projects should I deprioritize to pay attention to this new project?"
D)	Collaborating with others is an important element of life. The thought of straining the   relationship outweighs the commitment of our time and energy. For this reason, it can  be  helpful  to  be  gracious  in  your  response.  Do  whatever  favors  you  can,and  be warm-hearted and direct when you have to say no.But even after we have accounted for these social considerations, many of us still seem to do a poor job of managing the  	trade-off between yes and no.We find ourselves over-committed to things that don't meaningfully improve or support those around us, and certainly don't improve our own lives. 
E) Perhaps one issue is how we think about the meaning of yes and no. The words“yes” and“no”get so often used in comparison with each other that it feels like they carry  equal weight in conversation. In reality, they're  not just  opposite  in meaning,but  of entirely different magnitudes in commitment. When you  say“no”,you're only  saying

2022年12月英语四级真题第2套第5页共10页 by: 光速考研

“no”to   one  option.When  you   say“yes”,you're   saying“no”to  every  other  option.I like how  economist Tim Harford put it,“Every time we say 'yes' to  a request, we're also  saying‘no'to  anything  else  we  might  accomplish  with  the  time.”Once  you're  committed to something, you've already decided how that future block of time will be spent. In other words, saying“no”saves you time in the future. Saying“yes”costs you  time in the future.“No”is a form of time credit.You retain the ability to spend your future time however you want.“Yes”is a form of time debt.You have to pay back your  commitment at some point.
F) “No”is a decision.“Yes” is a responsibility. Saying“no”is sometimes seen as a luxury  that only those in power can afford.And it's true: turning down opportunities is easier   when you can fall back on the safety net provided by power, money,and authority. But   it's also true that saying“no”is not merely a privilege reserved for the successful.It's   also a strategy that can help you become successful.Saying ‘no”is an important skill to develop  at any stage of your career because it retains the most important asset in life: your time. As investor Pedro Sorrentino put it,“If you don't guard your time, people   will steal it from you.”You need to say“no”to whatever isn't leading you toward your   goals.
G) Nobody embodied this idea better than Steve Jobs, who said,“People think focus means  saying  'yes'to  the  thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at   all.It means saying  ‘no'to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick  carefully.”Jobs had  another  great  quote  about  saying“no”:“I'm  actually  as proud  of  the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying 'no'to 1,000  things.”
H) Over time, as you continue to improve and succeed, your strategy needs to change. The opportunity cost of your time increases as you  become  more  successful.At  first,you just eliminate the obvious distractions and explore the rest. As your skills improve and  you learn to separate what works from what doesn't, you have to continually increase  your threshold for saying“yes” .You still need to say“no”to distractions, but you also need to learn to say“no”to opportunities that were previously good uses of time, so you can make space for better uses of time.It's a good problem to have, but it can be a  tough skill to master.
I)	What is true about health is also true about productivity: an ounce of prevention  is worth a pound of cure. More effort is wasted doing things that don't matter than is  wasted doing things inefficiently. And if that is the case, elimination is a more useful  skill than  optimization.  I'm reminded  of the  famous  Peter  Drucker  quote,“There  is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.”
36.People often grant a request just because they want to appear polite and helpful.
37.It's no easy job learning to say“no”to opportunities that were once considered worth 
grasping.

38.When you decline a request, you are saving your future time.
39. People sometimes struggle to do things that are simply a waste of time. 40.Doing efficiently what is not worth doing is the most useless effort
41. It is especially difficult for people to decline to do what their superiors ask them to do.
42. People agree to do too many things they are in fact unwilling to do.
43.  According  to  one  famous  entrepreneur,innovation  means  refusal  to  do  an  enormous number of things.
44. It is an essential aspect of life to cooperate with other people.
45. Refusing a request is sometimes seen as a privilege not enjoyed by ordinary people.
Section  C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each  of them there are four choices marked A),B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2
with a single line through the centre.

Passage  One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　We're eating more fish than ever these days. At around 20 kilograms per person global fish  consumption  is  now  more  than  twice  what  it  was  in  the   1960s.  What's  really remarkable, though, is where that fish comes from.
For the first time in human history, most of our aquatic (水产的)food now comes
from farming rather than fishing.
　　　People ate around 73 million tonnes of farmed fish—just more than half of the volume of fish  that  humans  consumed—in  2014. That's  out  of a  total  fish  supply  of  167  million  tonnes; the remaining 20 million or so tonnes go into things like animal feed and medical products.
　　　To  keep  eating   fish   at  the   current  rate,we're   definitely   going   to  need  to  keep aquaculture(水产养殖)developing. That's because the volume offish caught in the wild has leveled off since the 1990s.
　　　Back  in  1974,  only  10%  of marine  fish  stocks had been  overfished.Now, more than three-tenths are. Only a tenth of our oceans' fish  stocks could sustain heavier fishing than current  levels.
　　　But while catchings at sea have suffered, fish-farming has been growing at a fast rate. A lot of that is coming from China, which produces 60% of the world's farmed fish. In fact, some 35 countries, including China, now produce more farmed than wild-caught fish.
　　　This shift toward aquaculture isn't just good for ensuring salmon ( 三 文 鱼 )on your plate;  it's  also  crucial  to  ensuring  food  security  and  sustainability.  By  2050,  the  world  will need  to  feed  an  estimated  9.7  billion  people.  They'll  have  to  get  their  protein  somewhere.  However,  raising  cattle,  pigs,  and  other  land-based  animals  requires  vast  sums  of grain  and  water. For  example, pound  for pound, beef requires  15 times more  feed to raise than  carp,  a  freshwater  fish  farmed  all  over  Asia.  That  grain-and  the  water  needed  to  grow  it-could  be
consumed  by  people  instead.
　　　However,  aquaculture  is  no  silver  bullet.  In  some   southeast  Asian   countries,   shrimp farming   does  disastrous   damage  to  marine   ecosystems.   Despite  these  problems,  however,
shrimp  continues  to  be  among  the  most  popular  sea  foods  worldwide.

46.What  does  the  author  say  is remarkable  about  the  fish we  eat?
A)They   reproduce   quickly.
B)  They  are mostly  farmed.
C)  They have become  as  important  as grain.
D) They have a longer history than humans.

47. What do we need  to do if we keep consuming fish at the current  rate?
A)Increase  the   fishing  volume   considerably.
B)Develop  more   advanced   fishing  technology.
C)Enlarge  the  marine  fish  stocks  effectively.
D)Expand   the   scale   offish-farming   continuously.

48.What  does  the  author  say  about  China  in  terms  of aquatic  food?
A)It  places  increasing  emphasis  on  fishing  now.
B) It boasts  of the world's largest  fishing  stocks.
C) It raises more fish than caught from the wild. D)It  supplies  60%  of the  world's  fish  products.

49.Why  does  the  author  say  aquaculture  is  so  important  these  days?
A)It  is  a  must  for  feeding  the  world's  fast-growing  population.
B) It proves  a reliable  source  of protein  for humans  and  animals.
C)It  is  essential  to  maintaining  both  mental  and  physical  health.
D)It    ensures a balanced healthy  diet  for people the world  over.

50.What  does  the  author  imply  by  saying  aquaculture  is  no  silver  bullet?
A)  Shrimp-farming  is  a  risky  business.
B)  Fish-farming  will  not  be  sustainable.
C)Fish-farming  may  cause  serious  problems  too.
D)  Shrimp-farming  can  become  quite  expensive.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
In 2020,the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the World Food Programme(WFP).
　　　Why a Nobel Prize for the WFP, and why now? In 2019, the WFP assisted nearly 100  million people in  88  countries. It is  the  safety net  for those who  fall  off the  edge  of existence. It is a response to solving the problem of food instability. Its Nobel Prize reminds  us all of the moral hazard in imagining that the poor and vulnerable are somebody else's  problem.
　　　The  WFP  has  been  around  since  1961  and  has  been  the  global  coordinator  of nationally based  efforts  to  avoid  disasters  with  food  aid.  Despite  decades  of effort  to  eliminate hunger, the latest estimate is that about 11% of people on the planet (about 820  million people) are suffering daily undernourishment. Progress at reducing undernourishment  has stopped despite gains through the 1990s and 2000s.
　　　Developed countries sometimes offer food and aid to developing ones, but at a price. One American philosopher stated that addressing the needs of the poor and vulnerable is about more than money—it is mostly about creating conditions under which prosperity and opportunity  can  thrive.  When  aid  is  offered with heavy  conditions  attached,  like  loan repayment or food for resources, it often widens the gap between rich and poor and sustains the old world order. This is why the work of the WFP is so vital.
　　　The  scientific  community,  however,  can  provide  a  helping  hand  to  the  WFP.By sharing knowledge of agriculture  and climate with peers in countries most vulnerable to poverty and hunger, scientists can help reduce these problems. By making its voice heard,  science can lead by example. The ability to overcome food shortages that must be built into some of the poorest countries will not come from loans from wealthy countries, which may  have food problems of their own, or world economic institutions. This ability will be built upon self-confident people using open and shared scientific knowledge to pull themselves  out of their misery

51.What does the WFP's winning of the Nobel Peace Prize make us realize?
A)More and more people in the world are suffering from starvation.
B)All of us can be affected by food instability one way or another.
C) It is hazardous to leave millions of people poor and vulnerable.
D) It is morally wrong to think helping the poor is not our business.

52.What do we learn about the WFP's effort to eliminate hunger?
A)It  has ensured a sufficient food supply to millions.
B) It is still far from its goal despite the progress made.
C) It has done a good job in combating natural disasters.
D)It is preventing starvation occurring on a global scale.

53.What will happen when food aid is offered at a price?
A) The rich will become richer and the poor poorer.
B) More people will be willing to join in the effort.
C) More food will be made available to the needy.
D) The relief effort will be rendered less sustainable.

54.How  can scientists help cope with poverty and hunger?
A)By collaborating closely with world economic institutions.
B)By sharing expertise with peers in poverty-stricken nations.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　　Phones influence all aspects of teenage life. Ninety-five percent of Americans ages  13  to  17 have  a  smartphone  or have  access  to  one,  and  nearly  half report  using  the  internet “almost     26   . ”
　　　But as recent survey data and interviews have suggested, many teens find much of that time  to  be  unsatisfyingly  spent.  Continuous    27  shouldn't   be   mistaken   for   endless  enjoyment.  A  new      28     representative    survey    about“screen    time    and    device  distractions”from  the  Pew  Research  Center  indicates  that  it's  not just  parents  who  think  teenagers   are   worryingly     29   from  their  phones—many  teens  themselves  do  too.  Fifty-four percent of the  13-to- 17-year-olds surveyed said they spend too much time   30 in their phones.
　　　Vicky Rideout, who runs a research firm that studies children's interactions with media   and technology, was not surprised by this finding. She says it's hardly .   31   to teenagers. “They are dealing with the same challenges that adults are, as far as they are living in the   	32   of a tech environment designed to suck as much of their time onto their devices as   possible,”Rideout   says.
　　　The way parents interact with technology can   33  the way they  interact with their  kids. Rideout thus thinks it's up to parents to model good   34   : Kids tend to take note if their parents put their phone away at dinner or charge it in another room while they sleep.  Witnessing habits like that can help kids“realize that they can   35   some  more  control  over  their  devices,”she  says.

Answer Sheet 2.
Evil  Genius
A)	A few years ago I found myself teaching a university class on evil.It was for third-year  criminology    students    to    help    them    contextualize    theory    and    research    within controversial  current  topics.  It  was  a  huge  success.  The  debates  were  heated  and interesting. I could see people's views change within the course of a single lecture.Over  the  past  13  years,  as  a  student,  lecturer  and  researcher,  I've  enjoyed  discussing  the  science of evil with anyone willing to listen. What I like most is destroying the cliche  (陈词滥调)of good and evil, and replacing them with scientific insight. We need a more informed way of discussing behavior that at first we cannot, or should not, begin to  understand.
B)	Without  understanding,  we  risk  dehumanizing  others, writing  off human beings  simply because we don't comprehend them. We must try to understand what we have labeled  evil. We tend to think evil is something that other people are. We think of ourselves as  “good people”,and  even when we  do morally wrong things,we understand the  context  of our decisions. With others, however, it is far easier to write them off. If their actions  deviate (偏离)substantially from what we consider acceptable, we may label them evil. We need to be  careful with this.  Calling  someone  evil is  often  similar to  saying they  cannot change,and perhaps aren't even a human at all. However, when you actually go  monster-hunting, and you look deeply at the people behind shocking behavior, you may  be  surprised
C)	As   a   child   I   used   to   love   the   Scooby-Doo   cartoons.   Arriving    in   their “Mystery Machine”, the gang would have to find a monster who was terrorizing a neighborhood.  They would run  around looking  for clues  and at the  end unmask the bad guy. It was  always a normal person in a costume. There were no monsters. Like the Scooby crew,  we may find ourselves hunting for an easy fix, one word  for people who do bad things.But   if  we  take   a   good   look,  the  word“evil”is   insufficient—there   are  no   simple explanations for why humans do bad things:instead there are many, and they are all marvelously different.
D)	Evil is typically referred to when there is deviance from social norms:formal deviance is  the  violation  of  laws,  like  theft,  murder,and  attacks,  while  informal  deviance involves violations of social norms, like lying. Evil behavior is typically thought to embrace one or both forms. However, deviance can also describe a behavior that simply differs from the norm.
E)	Perhaps this is where we can find the good side of our bad side. Deviating from the norm can make us villains(恶棍),but it can also make us heroes.A child deviates from social pressures when they stand up for another child being bullied in school.A soldier deviates  when  they  choose  not  to  follow  orders  to  kill  an  innocent  civilian.  An employee in a big tech company deviates when they expose its wrongdoings.
F)	Creativity  is  also  a  deviation.  Here,too, things  are  complex.  Thinking  creatively has given us modern medicine,technology and modern political structures, but it has also given us poison and nuclear weapons. Great benefit and great harm can come from the same human tendency.
G) In a research paper, Evil Genius, published in 2014, the behavioral scientists Francesca Gino and Scott Wiltermuth wanted to examine whether people who behave unethically in one task are more creative than others on a subsequent task, even after controlling for differences  in  baseline  creative   skills.  The  unethical  behavior  they  chose  was dishonesty.
H) Over five experiments researchers gave participants tasks in which they could cheat. In one study,they were given matrixes(矩阵)and had to find two numbers that added up to 10.Participants were asked to self-report how well they did at the end of the study: 59% cheated by saying that they solved more matrixes than they actually had.
I) 	 After  each  task,  the  researchers  measured  participants'  performance  on  the  Remote Associates  Test.  This  shows  participants  three  words  at  a  time  that  appear  to  be unrelated, and the person has to think of a fourth word that is associated with all of them.  For  example,you might  get“Fox,  Man,  Peep”,or“Dust,  Cereal,  Fish” .In  order to find the linking words(“Hole”for the first,“Bowl”for the  second) you need to be creative. The more you get right, the more creative you are thought to be because you have come up with uncommon associations.
J) 	For every one of the five studies,they found the same thing—participants who cheated in the first task did better on the creativity task. Why? Like other forms of unethical behavior, lying means breaking rules. It involves being deviant, going against the social principle that people should tell the truth. Similarly, being creative involves“thinking outside the box”,deviating from expectations. They involve similar thought patterns, so stimulating one stimulates the other. Can we learn from this? Perhaps. To be more creative,we could try lying in a controlled environment. Find online logic games and cheat at them, play Scrabble (拼字游戏)with a dictionary, or write a story about something that is untrue? Such tasks can get our brains thinking flexibly, beyond our  normal comfort zone. This is not a call to become  a  compulsive (强迫性的)liar, but a controlled  liar.

2022年12月英语四级真题第3套第3页共7页 by: 光速考研

K)	In addition to benefits for creativity, deviance can be a good thing in other ways. Even Philip Zimbardo, the author of the Stanford prison experiment, who showed how easily we  can be  led to behave badly, believes that the  future  of deviance research may  lie more   in  understanding   extreme  pro-social  behavior,   such   as  heroism.Like   evil,we often view heroism as only a possibility for outliers—for people who are abnormal. But Zimbardo  asks:“What  if the  capability to  act heroically  is  also  fundamentally  ordinary and   available  to  all  of  us?”Some  say  we  should  never  meet  our  heroes,  lest  they disappoint us when we find out how normal they are. But this should be liberating, not disappointing. We are all capable of behaving like outliers. It's time for us to understand deviance, and realize its potential for good as well as for harm.
36.A behavior that does not conform to social norms may be described as being deviant.
37.Various   experiments  found  that  participants  who  cheated  in  the  initial  task  performed better in the creativity test.
38.People may be simply considered evil if their behaviors are morally unacceptable to us.
39.The  research  published  by  two  scientists  was  intended  to  examine  the  relationship
between dishonesty and creativity.
40.The author's lectures sparked lively discussions in his class.
41.The  researchers  tested  the  participants'  creativity by asking them to play a word game.
42.It  is  time  we  realized  that  deviance may be  capable  of doing both  good  and harm to individuals  and  society.
43. The reasons for people's evil behaviors  can be explained in more ways than one.
44. The math task in one experiment was designed to test participants'tendency to cheat. 45.Some creative ideas have turned out to do harm to human society.

Section   C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B), C) and D).

Passage  One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Even though we are living in an age where growing old is thought of as an inevitable misery,this doctor has been changing the game for seniors over the last 25 years.
　　　It  all  started  in   1991  when  the  Harvard-educated  physician  was  transferred  from   working in a stressful emergency room to being the medical director of a nursing home in upstate New York. The depressing and regimented(严格管制的)environment got him thinking on what exactly could improve the residents' conditions.
　　
　　2022年12月英语四级真题第3套第4页共7页 by: 光速考研
　　
　　　Even though animals in nursing homes were illegal at the time, Dr. Bill Thomas took a
　　　chance. Based on a hunch (直觉),he brought in two dogs, four cats, hens,   rabbits,100 birds, a multitude of plants,a flower garden, and a vegetable patch.
　　　The change was dramatic. There was a 50% drop in medical prescriptions along with a dramatic decrease in death rates—but most importantly, the residents were simply happier.
　　　Dr.  Thomas's  approach,  named  the  Eden  Alternative,  has  driven  nursing  homes  to   allow a more autonomous(自主的)and creative living space for their elderly. It erases the belief that  growing  old  means growing  useless.  He  encourages  residents  to  think  of their age as an enriching new phase of life rather than the end of it.
　　　Thomas,   now   a   speaker   and   author   of   several   books,   also   created    small,  independently-run  residences  with  their  own  bedrooms  and  bathrooms,  and  he  has  been preaching a singular message that getting old is not a bad thing.
　　　“Within  six weeks, they had to  send  a truck  around to pick up  all the wheelchairs,” Thomas  told  the  Washington  Post.“You  know  why  most  people  in  nursing  homes  use  wheelchairs? Because the buildings are so big.”
　　　The 56-year-old doctor's methods have been adopted in Australia, Japan, Canada, and America  with  enormous  success.  Last  year  he  published  Second  Wind:Navigating  the Passage  to  a  Slower,  Deeper,  and  More  Connected  Life,  a  guide  on  how  to  shift  our perspectives on aging and growth.
　　　He  is  currently  traveling  through  North  America  performing  with  his  guitar  and  his enthusiasm on his Age of Disruption Tour.
46. What has Bill Thomas been doing for a quarter of a century? A)Transforming  people's  lifestyle.
B) Honoring his Harvard education.
C) Changing people's philosophy of life.    D)Shifting  people's  perspective  on  aging.

47.Why did Bill Thomas try something different in the nursing home?
A) He wanted to make it more pleasant for seniors.
B) He wanted to apply his Harvard training to practice.
C) He felt it his duty to revolutionize its management.
D)He felt disappointed working in the environment.

48.What do we learn about Bill Thomas bringing animals and plants into the nursing home? A)He made a mess of the nursing home.
B)He did something all professionals would do.
C) He won instant support from the state authorities.
D) He acted in violation of the state law.

49.What has Bill  Thomas been persistently  advocating?
A)Good health is not just a privilege of the young.
B)Nursing homes should be strictly limited in size.
C)Getting old is by no means something miserable.
D) Residences for seniors should be run independently.

50.How is Bill Thomas's new concept received?
A)It is gaining ground in many countries.
B) It is being heatedly debated worldwide.
C) It is considered revolutionary everywhere.
D) It is winning approval from the government.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　Research shows that in developed countries, more affluent and educated people tend to   consume higher-quality diets—including more fruits and vegetables, fish and whole grains. On the contrary,economically disadvantaged people report diets that are nutrient-poor and energy-dense. They are less likely to have food-purchasing habits that conform to public
health recommendations.
　　These  dietary  differences  are  often  accompanied  by  higher  rates  of obesity  and   diabetes  among  lower-income  people.  This  relationship  between  social  class  and  diet quality and health is extensively documented. However, the research does not explain why this is the case—a question that has significant implications for designing effective policies and initiatives to improve diets and prevent chronic diseases.
　　Public-health initiatives to promote healthy diets often focus on providing nutrition   education and recipes(食谱).These  approaches, however, often presume less food literacy (i.e.food knowledge and skills) among low-income people. Are unhealthy diets really the result of poor choices, limited food skills and knowledge?
　　Research suggests that adults in food-insecure households are just as likely as those in   food-secure households to adjust recipes to make them more healthy. They are also just as proficient in food preparation and cooking skills. There is no indication that increasing food skills or budgeting skills will reduce food insecurity.
　　Instead,disadvantaged groups are constrained by their economic, material and social   circumstances. For example,low income is the  strongest predictor of food insecurity in Canada, where one in eight households experiences insufficient access to nutritious foods.
　　It's well-established that  food prices  are  an  important  determinant  of food  choice.   Low-income households report that they find it difficult to adopt dietary guidelines because food prices are a barrier to improving their diets.
　　When researchers estimate the cost of diets people actually eat, higher-quality diets are typically more costly.
　　While this may be so, it does not, in itself, prove that healthy diets are necessarily   more  expensive  or  cost-prohibitive.  After  all,  not  all  socioeconomically  disadvantaged people consume poor diets.
We can easily think of a number of foods and recipes that are both inexpensive and nutritious. The internet is full of recipes for“eating well on a budget.”
51.What can we learn from research on diets in developed countries?
A)Dietary recommendations are not fit for underprivileged people.
B)People from different social groups vary in their dietary habits.
C) People's choice of food depends on their individual taste.
D) There is no consensus on what high-quality diets are.

52.What does the author say is important in formulating policies to improve diets and health? A)A better understanding of the relationship between social class and health.
B) A greater emphasis on studying the cause of obesity and chronic diseases.
C) Prioritizing the provision of better nutrition for lower classes.
D) Designing education programs and initiatives on public health.

53.What does research reveal about adults in food-insecure households?
A) Their eating habits need to be changed.
B) Their food literacy has been improving.
C) They do not pay much attention to their food recipes. D)They do not lack food knowledge or budgeting skills.

54.What would help improve food security among the disadvantaged groups in Canada? A)Teaching them budgeting  skills.
B) Increasing their food choices.
C) Enabling them to have more access to nutritious foods.
D)Taking more effective measures to increase food supplies.

55.What does the author suggest disadvantaged people do to improve their health?
A) Adopt a positive attitude towards dietary guidelines.
B) Choose diets that are both healthy and affordable.
C) Make sure to purchase healthy foods on the internet.
D)Change their eating habits and consumption patterns.

　　　冬至 (Winter Solstice) 是全年白昼最短、黑夜最长的一天，标志着一年中最寒冷时节的 开始。冬至过后，气温越来越低，人们的户外活动逐渐减少。农民地里活儿不多，主要忙于 灌溉系统的维护和农作物的防冻，同时为来年春天播种做准备。
　　　中国人历来很重视冬至，许多地方都把冬至当作一个节日，庆祝方式各地不尽相同。北 方人有冬至吃饺子 (jiaozi)的习俗，南方人有冬至吃汤圆(tangyuan)的传统。

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　　It’s a fantasy that goes back centuries: a message in a bottle, carried ashore from far-off lands. Authors, artists and children   26   have dreamed of such a gift from the sea.
　　　This time, though, it’s not a bottle that washes ashore. It’s eggs—thousands of little toy eggs.
　　　That’s what happened on the German island of Langegoog this week.
　　　Lying just off the North Sea coast, it found itself   27   by an invasion of colored plastic eggs—much to the   28    of local children, because the eggs contained toys.
　　　Police   29   the eggs came from a freighter that lost part of its cargo during an unusually   30   storm, the worst to hit Germany’s northeastern coast since 2006.

Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Hyphenating your last name after marriage?
A)	Congratulations on deciding to get married! While being married is great and wonderful, the act of getting married can be quite stressful. There is the planning of the ceremony itself, the merging (合并) of two households and all of the details involved in that.You also have to take the time to apply for your marriage license and then decide whether or not you are going to keep your last name or change it.
B) 	This is where a lot of people have trouble. Once upon a time, it was just customary for a bride to take her groom’s last name as her own and abandon her maiden name completely. The act of keeping her own last name was considered taboo (禁忌) and people’s eyebrows would raise right off their faces when they found out that the bride was even considering something so radical.Over time, though, more and more women are deciding to keep their last names.
C)	There are a lot of reasons to want to keep your own last name. Hopefully you have a supportive groom who understands why this idea is the most appealing to you. A lot of times, though, the act of keeping your name is still something that causes concern. Even if your groom is fine with it, his family (or your own) might not be so understanding.
D)	There are a couple of ways to compromise on the issue.You could choose an entirely new last name for the two of you to share. This way neither of you gets “your” way and you both have to deal with the legalities of going through a name change. Most of the time, though, the most popular compromise is to hyphenate your last name and the last name of your groom. For example, if your groom’s name is John Smith and your name is Kate Jones, you would name yourself Kate Jones-Smith or Kate Smith-Jones. This allows you to keep going by your own last name while legally adopting your husband's last name at the same time.
E)	The compromise is the biggest reason that so many women choose to hyphenate their last names. It is a way of you keeping your own identity while also making your future husband happy. It allows you to stay connected to accomplishments that you achieved before you got married. For example, many women who choose to hyphenate do so partially because they have earned higher educational degrees and certifications under their maiden names. They might have also had things published or publicized and want to stay connected to that identity. Hyphenating your last name can help you bridge the gap between your personal and professional lives. Many women who opt to simply keep their own names do so because they don’t want to give up all that they have accomplished professionally. Adopting their husband’s last name makes it hard for them to claim ownership of these accomplishments personally because they happened under their “other” name.
F)	While tradition is one thing, there isn’t any logical reason to completely change your name. Keeping your name and joining it to your husband’s through hyphenation is as legal as simply adopting his name or as simply keeping your own and leaving his out of the picture entirely.
G)	Probably the most important reason to consider hyphenation is your identity. You’ve spent your whole life building your identity under a certain name. Obviously you will still be you even if you’ve taken on your husband’s last name and omitted yours entirely. At the same time, your name is associated with the identity you’ve built up and hyphenation allows you to respect that while also respecting tradition and your husband’s family’s identity.
H)	If you care about outside opinions on your name, you should know that a large portion of today’s society is annoyed by the hyphenated name. Some people find it “snobby” (势利的) and others simply find it irritating because they have a hard time remembering which last name they are supposed to say first. Some people even believe that not simply adopting your husband's last name is a huge sign of disrespect and a lack of commitment.
I)	It is possible that your future husband will find this choice offensive. Some men, regardless of how you might feel about such things, are traditionalists and feel that it is simply “right” for the woman to take the man’s last name as her own. Whether your future husband insisting on your adopting his last name is a red flag to you or not, it is still something that you should take into consideration.
J) 	There are all sorts of reasons to hyphenate your name or not to hyphenate your name. The basis for each of these things, however, is whether or not you are willing to make a compromise when it comes to changing your name. The hyphenation is the epitome (体现) of a compromise.One spouse wants a complete name change. The other spouse wants no name change. Hyphenating the two names is a way for each person to, at least a little bit,“win”the argument.
K)	And don’t forget the legal stuff! Making the decision is just part of the process. From there you are going to have to legally change your name all over the place. You’ll need to change your name at the bank,with social security, with your credit cards, on your driver's license, at the gym…everywhere. It’s easy to get overwhelmed just thinking about it.
L)	What matters, of course, is that the two of you are going to be happily married —hopefully for the rest of your lives. At the end of the day, whether you each keep your names, whether you come up with an entirely new name for the two of you to share or whether you hyphenate your current last names, what matters is that you love each other and are going to be joining your lives together. Try to remember that as you are staring at the application for your marriage license and filling out the portion that reads“name after you get married”(or whatever the legalese for that might be).
36.	Many people today still find name hyphenation upon marriage unacceptable.
37.	As a compromise, a bride will in most cases adopt a name that combines the couple’s last names.
38. The bride should consider adopting her groom’s last name whether he feels strongly about it or not.
39.	Making preparations for marriage causes a lot of stress.
40.	Hyphenating the last names could be a win-win solution should arguments arise about what name to adopt upon marriage.
41.	It used to be considered socially unacceptable for a bride to retain her maiden name.
42.	The bride who adopts a hyphenated last name after marriage can maintain connections with their past achievements.
43.	Hyphenating names allows the bride to preserve her own identity while respecting tradition.
44.	No matter what name the bride adopts, it is most important that the newly weds truly love each other.
45.	Legally speaking, the bride is free to choose whatever name she prefers.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　It’s good to be smart. After all, intelligent people earn more money, accumulate more wealth, and even live longer. But there’s another side to the story. The brightest people and strongest leaders sometimes make errors others don’t, especially in situations that require common sense.
　　　Travis Bradberry, president at TalentSmart, explained in his post Why Smart People Act So Stupid that “Rational thinking and intelligence don’t tend to go hand in hand. Intelligent people are more prone to silly mistakes because of blind spots in how they use logic. These blind spots exist because smart people tend to be overconfident in their reasoning abilities.” They are so used to being right and having quick answers that they don’t even realise when they’re making a mess by answering without thinking things through.
　　　A lifetime of praise leads smart people to develop too much faith in their intelligence and abilities. They often fail to recognise when they need help, and when they do recognise it,they tend to believe that no one else is capable of providing it.
　　　“It’s hard for anyone to graciously accept the fact that they’re wrong. It’s even harder for smart people because they grow so used to being right all the time that it becomes a part of their identity,” Bradberry wrote. “For smart people, being wrong can feel like a personal attack, and being right, a necessity.”
　　　Smart people also have a hard time accepting feedback. They tend to undervalue the opinions of others, which means they have trouble believing that anyone is qualified to give them useful feedback. Not only does this tendency hinder their growth and performance, it can lead to harmful relationships, both personally and professionally.
　　　Smart people develop overachieving personalities because things come so easily to them. They simply don’t understand how hard some people have to work to accomplish the same things, and because of that, they push people too hard.They set the bar too high, and when people take too long or don’t get things quite right, they assume it’s due to a lack of effort. So they push even harder.
46. What do we learn from the passage about the brightest people?
　　A) They can make silly mistakes in straightforward situations.
　　B) They usually turn a blind eye to their own weaknesses.
　　C) They are admired by people around them.
　　D) They can differ in their personalities.
47. What accounts for the existence of intelligent people’s logical blind spots?
　　A) Their irrational way of thinking.	
　　B) Too much faith in their ability to think.	
　　C) Their ignorance of behavioural science.
　　D) Too much concern about their work.
48. How do smart people react when they are found to be wrong?
　　A) They shift the blame to others.	C) They may feel shocked.
　　B) They graciously accept the facts.	D) They may get offended.
49. What may happen to smart people who find it difficult to accept suggestions?
　　A) They may suffer in their professional and private life.
　　B) They may lose faith in their administrative abilities.
　　C) They may commit more errors than ever before.
　　D) They may experience a lot of emotional stress.
50. What is said about those working with or under overachieving people?
　　A) They put a lot of effort into their work.		C) They are under increasing pressure.
　　B) They set higher goals for themselves.		D) They take less time to get things done.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Of the endless troubles that come with being driven from one’s home country,losing educational certificates may seem small. But it isn’t. Refugees who settle in other countries often find themselves unable to continue on their previous career path due to a new set of employer standards or skills requirements. To solve this problem, the U.S. State Department is posing a solution: online learning.
　　　The State Department will announce a partnership with an online education platform called Coursera. The platform will allow refugees worldwide to take thousands of online courses for free. “Coursera for Refugees” will be available for any non-profit group that supports refugees in any country, as well as individual refugees. They can apply for  fully funded access to Coursera’s course catalog, which means they can take all of the platform’s classes and obtain professional certificates for free. The platform currently offers professor-led lectures on a broad range of topics, from data science to fashion design.
　　　As the world migrant crisis intensifies, employment is becoming a global concern. The new program aims to aid refugees by offering“important skills that will help them in the global economy,” Evan Ryan, U.S. assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs, said on a press call last week. “What we don't want to do is not act,” added Coursera chief operations officer Lila Ibrahim.
　　　The idea isn’t without problems. For one, starting a new career path isn’t as simple as watching a few videos and obtaining an online certificate; even those looking to continue previous careers can’t simply rely on an online lecture to get them up-to-date on standards, policies, and practices. For another, most of the classes on Coursera are in English, and though there are plans to add translations, language barriers can be a big obstacle. Then there are the questions over the value of massive open online courses (MOOCs) themselves—both for refugees and for average learners.
　　　But it’s still early days and there are signs of hope. In 2015, a joint study found 72% of people taking the MOOCs saw career benefits afterwards.
51. Why is the U.S. State Department launching an online learning program for refugees?
　　A) To enable them to settle down in host countries.
　　B) To allow them to learn as many job skills as possible.
　　C) To offer them a platform to pursue advanced degrees.
　　D) To help them to meet new employment standards.
52. What do we know about “Coursera for Refugees”?
　　A) It provides refugees with a wide range of courses free of charge.
　　B) It offers free online data services for refugees around the world.
　　C) It allows refugees to obtain degrees in various academic fields.
　　D) It supplies refugees with a great variety of job opportunities.
53. What does the passage say is a consequence of the global migrant crisis?
　　A) Instability increases in host countries.	
　　B) The global economic crisis intensifies.	
　　C) A lot more refugees die during migration.
　　D) Refugees find it more difficult to get a job.
54. What does the author say causes refugees’ diffculty in taking online courses?
　　A) Cultural environment.	C) Lack of language skills.
　　B) Changed academic requirements.	D) Difference in teaching platforms.
55. What did the joint study find about the MOOCs several years ago?
　　A) They helped solve learners’ financial problems.  
　　B) They benefited most of the learners.
　　C) They changed some learners’ career path.
　　D) They provided the most needed vocational skills.

Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　　You probably haven’t taken the time to think of all the work that went into creating the shirt on your back. I mean, how hard it could be to create fabric and 26  it into a shirt shape. Don’t machines do all that? Well, creating fabric from cotton, which is the most 	27clothing material, is actually a process that involves a lot of water, 2,700 liters per shirt to be   28 . Take a look at the video below from National Geographic for some more mind-blowing 29 about cotton clothing production.
　　　Clean water is  30 becoming one of the most sought-after resources in the world. Given how large the  31  and cotton industries are, they take up a lot of our fresh water demands across the world, according to The Huffington Post. The video from National Geographic was created to spread   32  of how environmentally harmful cotton is. But the situation can be made better. Through better water management and farming practices,  water usage in cotton production can be cut down by  33  40 percent.
　　　Called “Better Cotton”, this environmentally conscious product will save millions of liters of water a year simply from   34  the demands of cotton production. Cotton doesn’t have to go, since it is, after all, one of the most useful cash crops across the globe. However, as water supplies  35 , farmers and consumers need to be more conscious of the effect that these products have on the environment as a whole.

Section B
The spoken web
A)		We’re growing more used to chatting to our computers, phones and smart speakers through voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana. Blind and partially sighted people have been using text-to-speech converters for decades.
B)	Out of these assistants, Siriis the most well-known. The assistant uses voice inquiries and a natural­ language user inte rface (界面) to answer questions. The software adapts to users’ individual language usages, searches, and preferences, with continuing use.
C)	Some think voice could soon take over from typing and clicking as the main way to interact online. But what are the challenges of moving to “the spoken web”?
D)		What use is written online content if you can’t read? That is the situation facing illiterate (不识字的) African farmers. They are often denied crucial information the web offers many others. With a literacy rate in some parts of Africa at only 22.6%, farmers are often “underpaid for their produce because they might be unaware of the prevailing prices,” says Francis Dittoh, a researcher behind Mr Meteo, a speech-based weather information service.
E)	“The most frequently heard complaint is about rainfall predictions,” says Mr Dittoh, who lives in Tamale, northern Ghana. “They tell us the methods their forefathers used  to predict the weather don’t seem to work as well these days.” This is down to climate change, he believes. Yet knowing when it’s going to rain is vital for farmers wanting to sow seeds, irrigate crops or take their animals out to the fields to feed on grass.
F)	Mr Dittoh says the idea of converting online weather reports into speech came from the farmers themselves, after a workshop in the village of Guabuligah. “They came up with this,” he says. Mr Meteo takes the online weather forecast, converts it to a short recording in the appropriate language and makes it available on a basic phone. Farmers ring up to receive the information. The local language Dagbani is spoken by 1.2 million people but is not served by any online translation applications. The service was designed to be cheap and easy to run, says Mr Dittoh. He plans to begin field tests this month, working with Tamale’s Savanna Agricultural Research Institute.
G)		The spoken web could also help the one-in-five adults in Europe and the U.S. with poor reading skills. But building the spoken web-web-to-voice and voice-to-web—isn’t straightforward. For software to understand pizza is served at Italian restaurants is easy. To cover multiple domains and to be able to have a conversation with users on every single topic is still a long way off.
H)		So although many computer assistants can answer simple questions about the weather and play music for us, anything resembling a wide-ranging human conversation is decades away. Artificial intelligence just isn’t smart enough yet. Even turning your voice into text—automatic speech recognition—is one of the hardest problems to solve, as there are as many ways to pronounce things as there are people on the planet.
I)	Siri has often been praised for its ability to interpret our casual language and deliver very specific and accurate results, sometimes even providing additional information. But it is still somewhat restricted, particularly when the language moves away from stiffer commands into more human interactions. In one example, the phrase “Send a text to Jason, Clint, Sam, and Lee saying we’re having dinner at Silver Cloud restaurant” was interpreted as sending a message to Jason only, containing the text “Clint Sam and Lee saying we’re having dinner at Silver Cloud restaurant”. It has also been noted that Siri lacks a proper editing function, as saying “Edit message to say: we’re at Silver Cloud restaurant and you should come find us” generates “Clint Sam and Lee saying we’re having dinner at Silver Cloud restaurant to say we’re at Silver Cloud restaurant and you should come find us”.
J)	Using voice interaction feels far more intimate than surfing the net the old-fashioned way. This is intentional as the informal tone of the assistant helps create an emotional attachment. But if something speaks, it must also listen. Our phones are always near us and they are collecting data about us all the time. This has already raised privacy concerns. The American Civil Liberties Union has stated that digital assistants create a threat to privacy from hackers. Some people have other concerns. They worry assistants will one day be used to deliver advertising directly to us.
K)	But digital voices need more personality to make them popular. Robots are not yet witty, Siri is boring. The benefits of using voice instead of tapping fingers obviously. depend on the context. Doctors completing online forms about their patients by speech, for example, can dictate 150 words a minute, three times faster than typing on a keyboard. This enables them to spend less time on administration and more time with patients.
L)	Last year, speech recognition company Nuance helped a doctors’ surgery in Dukinfield, near Manchester, set up a speech system for the practice’s six doctors. Now they can dictate notes on a patient’s health condition and treatment and a smart assistant automatically enters the information into the right fields on a web form. Previously, the doctors made voice recordings that were then transcribed by secretaries—a process that was costly and likely to cause delays. The new system means letters to patients now have more detail.
M)		Using voice also makes sense when you’re doing other things with your hands. Think about when you’re cooking, and you just want to know what the next step in the recipe is. Your hands are covered with oil; you’re not going to get on the iPad, so it’s a lot more natural to talk. And speech obviously makes sense when you’re driving. In the U.S., 29% of drivers admit they surf behind the wheel, according to insurance firm State Farm. This is up from 13% in 2009. No wonder using mobile phones while driving causes more crashes a year than drink driving, says the U.S. National Safety Council.
36.		According to Francis Dittoh, their speech-based weather information service was meant to be inexpensive and easy to use.
37.		Using voice instead of typing enables doctors to spend more time taking care of patients.
38.		It is extremely difficult to convert voice into text because of different pronunciations.
39.		African farmers unable to read often don’t have access to important information conveyed online.
40.		Some phone users worry advertisers will take advantage of voice assistants to send ads directly to them.
41.		The spoken web is helpful when one’s hands are occupied.
42.		Some people believe online interaction would soon depend mainly on voice.
43.		Setting up a spoken web is by no means an easy task.
44.	Weather information is extremely important to farmers.
45.		Some people are concerned about privacy because their phones are constantly collecting their personal information.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　The United States is facing a housing crisis: Affordable housing is inadequate, while luxury homes abound (充裕) , and homelessness remains a persistent problem. Despite this, popular culture and the housing industry market happiness as living with both more space and more amenities (便利设施). Big houses are advertized as a reward for hard work and diligence, turning housing from a basic necessity into a luxury.
　　　This is reflected in our homes. The average single-family home built in the United States before 1970 was less than 1,500 square feet in size. By 2016, the average size of a new, single-family home was 2,422 square feet. What’s more, homes built in the 2000s were more likely than earlier models to have more of all types of spaces: bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, dining rooms, recreation rooms and garages.
　　　There are consequences of living big. As middle-class houses have grown larger, two things have happened. First, large houses take time to maintain, so cleaners and other low-wage service workers are required to keep these houses in order. Second, once-public spaces, where people from diverse backgrounds used to come together, have increasingly become privatized, leading to a reduction in the number of public facilities available to all, and a reduced quality of life for many. Take swimming pools. While in 1950, only 2,500 U.S. families owned pools, by 1999 this number was 4 million. At the same time, public municipal pools were often closed, leaving low-income people nowhere to swim.
　　　The trend for bigger housing thus poses ethical questions. Should Americans accept a system in which the middle and upper classes enjoy a luxurious lifestyle, using the low-wage labor of others? Are we willing to accept a system in which an increase in amenities purchased by the affluent means a reduction in amenities for the poor?
　　　I believe neither is acceptable. We must change the way we think: living well does not need to mean having more private spaces; instead, it could mean having more public spaces. A better goal than building bigger houses for some is to create more publicly accessible spaces and amenities for all.
46.What are big houses promoted to be in the United States?
　　A) A luxury for the homeless.	
　　B) A reward for industriousness.	
　　C) An abundant source of comforts.
　　D) An absolute necessity for happiness.
47.What is one of the consequences of living big?
　　A) Many Americans’ quality of life has become lower.
　　B) People from diverse backgrounds no longer socialize.
　　C) People no longer have access to public swimming pools.
　　D) Many Americans’ private life has been negatively affected.
48.What questions arises from living big?
　　A) Questions related to moral principles.
　　B) Questions having to do with labor cost.
　　C) Questions about what lifestyle to promote.
　　D) Questions concerning housing development.
49.What kind of social system does the author think is unacceptable?
　　A) One in which the wealthy exploit the low-wage laborers building their houses.
　　B) One in which the rich purchase amenities at an increasingly unjustifiable price.
　　C) One in which the upper classes deprive the lower classes of affordable housing.
　　D) One in which the affluent enjoy a more comfortable life at the expense of the poor.
50.What does the author advocate for people to live well?
　　A) Finding ways to turn private spaces into public ones.
　　B) Building more houses affordable to those less affluent.
　　C) More public spaces created for everyone to enjoy.
　　D) All amenities made accessible to the rich and the poor alike. 
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Most of us in the entrepreneurial community are blessed—or cursed-with higher-than-average ambition. Ambitious people strongly desire accomplishments and are willing to take more risks and spend more effort to get them.
　　　Overall, this is a positive quality, especially for people trying to build their own businesses. Apparently, if you’re more naturally driven to set goals, you are more likely to succeed. 
　　　Actually, this isn’t always the case. In fact, in some cases, extreme ambition may end up doing more harm than good. 
　　　One major side effect of excessive ambition is the tendency to focus too determinedly on one particular vision or end goal. This is problematic because it hinders your ability to adapt to new circumstances, which is vital if you want to be a successful entrepreneur. If a new competitor emerges to threaten your business, you may need to change direction, even if that means straying from your original vision. If you have too much ambition, you’ll find this hard, if not impossible. 
　　　Few people are successful when they try to build their first brand. Unfortunately, for the most ambitious entrepreneurs, a failure is seen as disastrous, and impossible to recover from. 
　　　It’s a clear departure from the intended plan toward the intended goal. For people with limited ambition, however, failure is viewed as something closer to reality. Remember, failure is inevitable, and every failure you survive is a learning experience. 
　　　Ambitious people tend to be more materialistically successful than their non-ambitious counterparts. However, they’re only slightly happier than their less-ambitious counterparts, and tend to live significantly shorter lives. This implies that even though ambitious people are more likely to achieve conventional “success,” such success means nothing for their health and happiness—and if you don’t have health and happiness, what else could possibly matter?
　　　Clearly, some amount of ambition is good for your motivation. Without any ambition, you wouldn’t start your own business, set or achieve goals and get far in life. But an excess of ambition can also be dangerous, putting you at risk of burnout, stubbornness and even a shorter life.
51. What does the author think of most entrepreneurs?
　　A) They are more willing to risk their own lives.
　　B) They are more ambitious than ordinary people.
　　C) They achieve greater nonconventional success.
　　D) They have more positive qualities than most of us.
52. What does the author imply by saying “this isn’t always the case” (Line 1, Para. 3)?
　　A) Ambitious people may not have a greater chance of success.
　　B) Ambitious people may not have more positive qualities.
　　C) Entrepreneurs’ ambition does as much good as harm.
　　D) Entrepreneurs are more naturally driven to success.
53. What does the author say is of extreme importance for one to become a successful entrepreneur?
　　A) Holding on to one’s original vision.
　　B) Being able to adapt to new situations.
　　C) Focusing determinedly on one particular goal.
　　D) Avoiding radical change in one’s career direction.
54. How do the most ambitious entrepreneurs regard failure in their endeavor?
　　A) It will awaken them to reality.
　　B) It is a lesson they have to learn.
　　C) It means the end of their career.
　　D) It will result in a slow recovery.
55.What does the author advise us to do concerning ambition?
　　A) Distinguish between conventional success and our life goal.
　　B) Follow the example of the most ambitious entrepreneurs.
　　C) Avoid taking unnecessary risks when starting a business.
　　D) Prioritize health and happiness over material success.

New Formula One Chief Hopes to Grab Americans’Attentio
A)	For the past four decades, the leader of Formula One car racing, one of the biggest annual sporting series in the world, was Bernie Ecclestone, a former motorcycle parts dealer who built it into an international presence essentially on his own.
B)	A skilled backroom operator who speaks without a filter, Ecclestone said often that in his opinion, the sport was at its best when he was allowed to act as “a dictator.”
C)	Yet now the dictator is gone. After an American company, Liberty Media, acquired the Formula One competition recently, Chase Carey—a former executive with Fox Broadcasting Company and DirecTV who by his own admission is not a fierce racing fan-was named to replace Ecclestone and to try to renovate the organization’s management, reach and ambition.
D)	Among the goals, Carey said in an interview on Tuesday, is one that just about every global sport seems interested in chasing: increasing interest in the United States. “People have said we’re going to ‘Americanize’ it,” Carey said. “And we’re not going to do that totally. But realistically, there are some elements of Americanization that the sport could use.”
E)	While Formula One commands enormous audiences throughout much of the world, many American sports fans know it as that other motorsport, the one that is not Nascar (纳斯卡车赛). Formula One teams race far more technologically advanced vehicles around tracks all over the world-in magnificent events in places like Malaysia, Monaco, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, and on tradition­rich tracks like Silverstone in England and Monza in Italy too.
F)	The series has an annual race in Austin, Texas. But within “a few years,” Carey said, he plans to bring another to a destination American city, like New York, Los Angeles, Miami or Las Vegas. Carey’s ambitious plan is two-fold: first, change the business model of Formula One, which he said was a “one-man show” under Ecclestone that had a largely narrow vision when it came to negotiating partnership deals; and second, alter the way fans experience the sport, both in person and remotely, so that connections between the audience and people within the series are easier to make.
G)		Increased digital access for fans, a more behind-the-scenes experience for broadcast viewers and innovation in areas like virtual reality—what is it like to speed around a track inside a Ferrari?—are among the possibilities. “The sport has clearly been underserved,” Carey said. “It doesn’t do anything digitally. There’s no marketing. It doesn’t tell any stories. The goal in this is to make the fans connect to the live experience as much as possible, and the tools you have to do that, we’re not using at all.”
H)		The larger question, though, is a familiar one: Is there room for Formula One in the ever-crowded sports landscape of the United States? Opinions vary, particularly because viewing habits among consumers continue to evolve. John Bloom, a professor at Shippensburg University who has studied American sports history, said the biggest challenge for any sport trying to increase its presence in the United States was framing itself in a way that had lasting appeal. “Sports generally become popular in some way because they establish a narrative,” Bloom said. “When I think of motorsports in the U.S., what we all think of is Nascar, and the narrative of Nascar is sort of rural, white, working-class Americans, mostly in the South, connecting with the atmosphere of those races. That’s the narrative. When I think of the narrative of Formula One, it’s a very different kind of audience.”
I)	That difference, Carey said, is significant. While some might immediately link Formula One to Nascar in terms of American growth, Carey said Formula One’s brand research had indicated there was very little crossover; rather, Formula One fans generally cite other so-called elite events, like Wimbledon or the Ryder Cup, as competitions they enjoy. “Other than they’re both cars, the Nascar fan base is a very different fan base,” Carey said. “It’s a very regional fan base. Formula One is a global, famous brand of stars. These are machines that shock and awe you.”
J)	Carey’s background is in deal making and innovation. At Fox Broadcasting Company, he was a top advisor for years, known for his skill in helping to lead the launch of the company into sports, as well as the start of Fox News Channel. After going to DirecTV, he positioned the satellite provider as a mainstream option in millions of households.
K)		Now, after Liberty Media paid $ 4.4 billion to acquire Formula One, he is charged with making the investment pay off. “I think they can build Formula One in the U.S.,” said Patrick Crakes, an executive at InVivo Media Group who spent 25 years at Fox Broadcasting Company before leaving in 2016 as a senior manager at Fox Sports. “People don’t work on their cars anymore. They don’t want that connection anymore. It’s about technology and pushing the limits. It’s about speed, danger and risk. And Formula One has that more than any other racing series.”
L)	That is what hooked Carey, and he said he thought his experience was not unusual. He recalled attending Formula One’s Monaco race last year and being overwhelmed by the ceremony leading up to the event, the way the race charmed the city for days ahead of the start. In his mind, it felt like a Super Bowl（超级碗橄榄球赛）．
M)		Then, on race day, he watched as the cars rocketed out of a tunnel and went screaming toward a tight turn with the city’s harbor and the Mediterranean Sea in the background framing the scene. He was fascinated. “You can’t help but be awed,” he said, “and I think that feeling can be translated to the viewer.”
N)	He added: “The broader sport is a little too inward-looking, and we need to be more open. In some ways, I’m glad to be coming from the outside. The guys who are in the sport forever are sitting there saying: ‘We can’t do that. We can’t do that because it’s never been done that way.’”
36. Chase Carey believes greater use should be made of digital technology to make Formula One more accessible to its fans.
37. Chase Carey was deeply impressed by the ceremony preceding last year’s Monaco race.
38. One of Chase Carey’s goals is to make Formula One more appealing to Americans.
39. A former motorbike parts dealer led Formula One for the past forty years.
40. Chase Carey thought the audience of Formula One could be made to share his feeling about the race.
41. Chase Carey used to serve as a top advisor for a major broadcasting company.
42. Chase Carey intends to make connections easier between the audience and the Formula One racers.
43. The new leader of Formula One admitted he was not super interested in car racing.
44. People’s opinions differ as to whether Formula One can be promoted in the U.S.
45. Compared with other racing series, Formula One focuses more on speed and involves more danger.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Supermarkets have long been suffering as one of the thinnest -margined businesses in existence and one of the least-looked-forward-to places to work or visit. For more than a decade, they have been under attack from e-commerce giants, blamed for making Americans fat, and accused of contributing to climate change.
　　　Supermarkets can technically be defined as giants housing 15,000 to 60,000 different products. The revolutionary idea of a self-service grocery, where people could hunt and gather food from aisles rather than asking a clerk to fetch items from behind a counter, first came about in America. There is some debate about which was the very first, but over the years a consensus has built around King Kullen Supermarket, founded in New York in 1930.
　　　For some 300 years, Americans had fed themselves from small stores and public markets. Shopping for food involved mud, noisy chickens, clouds of flies, nasty smells,  bargaining, and getting short­changed. The supermarket imitated the Fordist factory, with its emphasis on efficiency and standardization, and reimagined it as a place to buy food. Supermarkets may not feel cutting-edge now, but they were a revolution in distribution at the time. They were such strange marvels that, on her  first official state visit to the United States in 1957, Queen Elizabeth II insisted on an impromptu (即兴的) tour of a suburban-Maryland Giant Food.
　　　The typical supermarket layout has barely changed over the past 90 years. Most stores open with flowers, fruit and vegetables at the front as a breath of freshness to arouse our appetite. Meanwhile, they keep the milk, eggs, and other daily basics all the way back so you’ll travel through as much of the store as possible, and be tempted along the way.
　　　In the early days, as the supermarket multiplied, so did our suspicion of it. We have long feared that this “revolution in distribution” uses corporate black magic on our appetite. The book The Hidden Persuaders, published in 1957, warned that supermarkets were putting women in a “hypnoidal trance (催眠恍惚状态), “causing them towander aisles  bumping into boxes and “picking things off shelves at random.”
46. What problem have supermarkets been facing?
　　A) They are actually on the way to bankruptcy.
　　B) They have been losing customers and profits.
　　C) They are forced to use e-commerce strategies.
　　D) They have difficulty adapting to climate change.
47. What does the passage say about the idea of a self-service grocery?
　　A) It was put forward by King Kullen.	
　　B) It originated in the United States.
　　C) It has been under constant debate.
　　D) It proves revolutionary even today.
48.What did supermarkets do by adopting the Fordist factory approach?
　　A) They modernized traditional groceries in many ways.
　　B) They introduced cutting-edge layout of their stores.
　　C) They improved the quality of the food they sold.
　　D) They revolutionized the distribution of goods.
49.What is the typical supermarket layout intended to do?
　　A) Arouse customers’ appetite to buy flowers, fruit and vegetables.
　　B) Provide customers easy access to items they want to buy.
　　C) Induce customers to make more unplanned purchases.
　　D) Enable customers to have a more enjoyable shopping experience.
50. What have people long feared about supermarkets?
　　A) They use tricky strategies to promote their business.
　　B) They are going to replace the local groceries entirely.
　　C) They apply corporate black magic to the goods on display.
　　D) They take advantage of the weaknesses of women shoppers.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　The traditional school year, with three months of vacation every summer, was first implemented when America was an agricultural society and the summer months were needed for farm work. Since then, we’ve completely changed as a nation. Students no longer spend summers farming, but they aren’t in school, either. The average American student receives 13 weeks off from school each calendar year-with about 11 of those during the summer. Few other countries have more than seven weeks off in a school calendar.
　　　With the U.S. lagging behind other countries in academics, it’s time to consider year-round schooling. One benefit of this change is that students will not fall victim to the “summer slide,” or the well­documented phenomenon where students forget some of the knowledge they have acquired when too much time is taken off from school. Decades of research shows that it can take from 8 to 13 weeks at the beginning of every school year for students to get back to where they were before the summer holiday.
　　　But year-round schooling isn’t just about academics. Teachers and students experience a closer relationship in year-round schools than they do in traditional schools and, in the absence of any long-term break, students do not feel detached from the school environment. These closer bonds and greater attachment pay off. Research shows that students in year-round schools are more self-confident and feel more positive about their schooling experience.
　　　But don’t kids need time to relax? Some childhood development experts believe that time off from school is vital to healthy development as kids are not designed to spend so much of their time inside classrooms and the summer break provides a perfect opportunity to get outside. The problem with this argument is that most children aren’t playing outside or even spending time with other kids. While some children visit summer camps, most stay at home, watching TV or playing games on electronic devices, which hardly benefits them.
　　　The U.S. has changed from a farming economy to a knowledge- and innovation-based economy, so it makes sense for the school year to change as well.
51.Why did America’s traditional school year have a three-month summer vacation?
　　A) Students needed to help with farm work.
　　B) Students needed time to learn necessary farming skills.
　　C) The agricultural society then attached less importance to academics.
　　D) America lagged behind other countries in making a scientific school calendar.
52.What benefit will year-round schooling bring students in addition, to improving their learning?
　　A) It will help them get back to where their lessons started.
　　B) It will enable them to absorb what they have learned.
　　C) It will familiarize them with the school environment.
　　D) It will strengthen their relationship with teachers.
53.What do some childhood development experts believe about the long summer vacation?
　　A) It meets students’ need to study on their own.
　　B) It enables students to learn about the outside world.

　　　Whether you’re just having a down day or a down period, taking a walk can instantly lift your mood, especially when you go outdoors. Not only can walking make you less depressed, but according to a new study, depression sufferers who took a  26 walk showed just as much improvement in their 27 as people taking medicine. In fact, 60-70 percent of the participants in the study could no longer even be  28  as depressed.
　　　Bone density may not be one of the most exciting health benefits of walking, but it’s an important one. People with stronger bones avoid osteoporosis（骨质疏松症）and all the problems that  29  with it, like breaks and other disabilities.

A Club Where Lions Dance and Traditions Take Root
A)	The first thing you notice in the staircase to the fourth-floor studio on Canal Street in Manhattan, New York, is the measured thumping (嘭嘭声) coming from behind a metal door. Just beyond the entrance, large lion masks were twisting and turning to the drum-beat. On a recent Friday evening, the teenagers made their way across the studio floor as they practiced Chinese lion dancing.
B)	“You want to play in a circle,” Victor Fong, aged 24, told his students at the New York Chinese Freemasons Athletic Club. “Take it slow and do it again.” The dance group, made up of 60 members, performs throughout the year but was now preparing for its biggest events, Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, which will begin on Saturday and conclude on February 15. Teenagers comprise about half of the group, many of whom began lion dancing at the age of 14. About 100 current and past members of the dance group—which has been performing since 1956—will be among the 220 groups marching through Chinatown in Manhattan for the 18th Lunar New Year Parade on February 5.
C)	Mr. Fong has been involved in the organization since he was 15 and began teaching lion dancing three years ago. But the club also acts as a recreation center and safe haven（庇护所）for teenagers, with video games readily available. As many as 20 students show up after school. “The basic requirement for hanging out here is you have to learn how to lion dance,” Mr. Fong said. While that is not a formal requirement for being a member, everyone finds a way to participate in the Lunar New Year Parade, whether it’s by dancing, carrying a flag or beating a drum.
D)	Alvin Chau, aged 26, is an environmental consultant by day and a lion dancer on weekends. He has been a club member for 10 years and joined because of an interest in lion dance. “We’re a big family,” he said, shaking hands with other members as they walked through the door. “You know everyone.”
E)	It is believed that the lion dance began in the third century. Stories vary about how lion dancingcame to be, but most of them include a monster named Nian who would terrorize a village. The villagers finally banded together and scared the beast away with firecrackers（爆竹）and drums. While lions are not native to China, some versions of the story include the villagers creating a monster of their own in the shape of a lion to fight off the beast.
F)	Today, the dancers travel across Chinatown going from business to business to bring good luck for the coming year. The new year—ac cording to the Chinese lunar calendar—will begin on Saturday and marks the Year of the Rooster (鸡年), which is thought to be a symbol of positivity. “It’s almost like the dark night is ending and the sun is coming up,” said Ya Yung Teng, the digital collections coordinator for the Museum of Chinese in America. “It’s hopeful that we’re going to have a new day.” Roosters and chickens are not particularly strong creatures, Ms. Teng said, but they are numerous. “In away,” she said, the rooster. “stands for ‘We the People.’”
G)	The lion head and tail are operated by two people. As one person controls the head, a second follows under a train of fabric representing the body. The dancers move in harmony as they imitate the animal’s natural movements in the wild, including the aggressiveness of an attack. A lion head figure weighs under 10 pounds and sits squarely on the dancer’s shoulders. Inside, the dancer manipulates strings that open and close the lion’s eyes, shake its ears and open its mouth to reveal a fire-orange tongue.
H) “A good lion dancer will imitate a living creature,” said Karlin Chan, aged 59, who heads the athletic club’s cqmmunity public relations. “I started lion dancing when I was a kid,” he said. “Chinatown was much, smailer then and it was a celebration with fireworks and firecrackers, which added a lot of flavor and meaning to it.”
I)	Mr. Chan buys a new lion head each year when he travels toChina.A head costs about $1,500. “If you want the good stuff, the quality, you have to see it for yourself,” he said. “I’ll inspect the product before we put it in the container and ship it over.” Mr. Chan, who has been involved with the club for nearly 50 years, said that passing the dance from one generation to the next was vital. “You need to pass on the traditions and the culture, and this is a part of our culture,” he said. “It’s a great way to promote cultural understanding and exchange; we welcome that.”
J)	For Sara Pore, aged 17, another club member, lion dance is more than just tradition; it provides a creative outlet. “Lion dancing started 2,000 years ago—that’s incredible,” she said. “But what makes you a competent lion dancer is that there’s a sense of imagination involved. Lion dancing teaches competence in leadership because of this. You’re constantly forced to push yourself past your limit.”
K) Back at rehearsal (排练), Just in Le, aged 18, tied a red ribbon around his waist to practice jumping. The dancers use the ribbons to pull themselves up over their partners’ heads. The room’s ceilings are too low to wear the lion heads for jumping practice, so once up on his partner’s head, Mr. Le held out his arms as if in offering.
L)	Mr. Le comes by the dance as a legacy（传承）．“I was born into it,” Mr. Le said, noting that his uncle and father were club members. “Growing up, I would always watch my family and see the lion dance, and I slowly grew interested in it.” By the age of 14, he was fully enrolled in the athletic club’s lion dance group. “I value my culture and tradition, being Chinese or Asian-American. I have a lot of pride in that,” he said. “I want to contribute and give back to the community.”
36.	The lion dancers perform from door to door to bring New Year wishes to business people.
37.	The NewYork dance club also serves as a place for entertainment where youngsters can enjoy themselves safely.
38.	Lion dancers need to have a little imagination to perform well.
39.	There are a number of different versions about the origin of the lion dance.
40.	Some 50% of the members of a New York lion dance club are teenagers.
41.	One club member says he feels proud of his cultural tradition.
42.	Two dancers coordinate their movements, one manipulating the lion’s head and the other its body.
43.	One lion dancer compares their New York dance club to a family.
44.	Lion dance should be handed down to future generations as part of Chinese culture.
45.	One lion dancer learned how to perform from his elders.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Team-building exercises have become popular for managers trying to increase organisational and team harmony and productivity. Unfortunately many employees resent compulsory bonding and often regard these exercises as a nuisance.
　　　A paper published this week by University of Sydney researchers in Social Networks has reported participants’ feelings about team-building interventions (干预), revealing ethical implications in forcing employees to take part.
　　　“Many people see team-building activities as a waste of time, so we decided to look in more depth at what’s behind this,” said the paper’s lead researcher, Dr Peter Matous.
　　　“Teams are formed, combined and restructured. Staff are relocated and office spaces redesigned. All this is done with the aim of improving workplace efficiency, collaboration and cohesion. But does any of this work?” said Dr Matous.
　　　The study found that team-building exercises which focused on the sharing of and intervening into personal attitudes and relationships between team members were considered too heavy-handed and intrusive, although the researchers say some degree of openness and vulnerability is often necessary to make deep, effective connections with colleagues.
　　　“Some participants were against team-building exercises because they were implicitly compulsory. They didn’t welcome management’s interest in their lives beyond their direct work performance,” said Matous. “Many people don’t want to be forced into having fun or making friends, especially not on top of their busy jobs. They feel management is being too nosy or trying to control their lives too much.”
　　　In this study the researchers recommended a self-disclosure (表露) approach where participants were guided through a series of questions that allowed them to increasingly disclose personal information and values. The method is well-tested and has been shown to increase interpersonal closeness. However, to be successful it must be voluntary.
　　　The researchers said there are numerous schools of thought that propose differing psychological methods for strengthening relationships. “With caution, many relational methods to improve teams and organisations can be borrowed from other fields. The question is how to apply them effectively to strengthen an entire collective, which is more than just the sum of individual relationships,” said Dr Matous.
46.Why are many employees opposed to team-building exercises?
A) They consider such exercises annoying.
B) They deem these exercises counter-productive.
C) They see such exercises as harmful to harmony.
D) They find these exercises too demanding.
47.What did Dr Matous and his team do to find out whether team-building activities would improve productivity?
A) They relocated team leaders and their offices.
B) They rearranged the staff and office spaces.
C) They redesigned the staff’s work schedules.
D) They reintroduced some cohesive activities.
48. What did the study by Matous’ team find about some team-building exercises?
A) They were intended to share personal attitudes and relationships.
B) They implicitly added to the vulnerability of team members.
C) They invariably strengthened connections among colleagues.
D) They were regarded as an intrusion into employees’ private lives.
49. How can the self-disclosure approach succeed in increasing interpersonal closeness?
A) By allowing participants freedom to express themselves.
B) By applying it to employees who volunteer to participate.
C) By arranging in proper order the questions participants face.
D) By guiding employees through a series of steps in team building.
50.What does Matous think of the various psychological methods borrowed from other fields for strengthening relationships?
A) They must be used in combination for an entire collective.
B) They prioritise some psychological aspects over others.
C) They place too much stress on individual relationships.
D) They have to be applied cautiously to be effective. 
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　There are close to 58,000 homeless people in Los Angeles county. That’s a shocking and tragic number for a region that’s home to some of the richest people in the world. At last, the problem became so acute—and so visible—that Los Angeles took extraordinary action. The citizens of this county voted in November2016 and again in March 2017 to raise their own taxes. The purpose of such action is to fund an enormousmultibillion-dollar, 10-year program of housing and social services for the homeless.
　　　As a result, Los Angeles now has its best chance in decades to combat homelessness. This is an opportunity that surely all can agree must not be wasted. It is neither desirable nor morally acceptable nor practical for this county to tolerate the signs of deprivation more commonly associated with the slums (贫民窟) of Rio de Janiero.
　　　How did we get here? For as long as there are homeless people, there is a tendency to blame the victims themselves for their condition—to see their failure to thrive as an issue of character, of moral weakness, of laziness. But contrary to popular belief, the homeless in Los Angeles are not mostly mentallyill or drug addicted or frightening, although a sizable minority meet some of those descriptions. Today, a greater and greater proportion of people living on the streets are there because of bad luck or a series of mistakes, or because the economy forgot them—they lost a job or were evicted (逐出) or fled an abusive marriage just as the housing market was growing increasingly unforgiving.
　　　The challenges are enormous, even if everyone is pulling in the same direction. That reality was driven home this month by a new Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority report showing that the county’s homeless population is growing faster than the supply of new housing.
　　　In the world’s richest nation, homelessness on this scale should be shameful and shocking. But most Los Angeles residents are no longer either shocked or shamed. Increasingly, we are uncomfortable, annoyed, disgusted, scared or unaware. Compassion (同情心) is being replaced by resignation.
51. Why did the citizens of Los Angeles vote to raise their own taxes?
A) To combat the county’s homelessness.
B) To reform the county’s service system.
C) To fund the development of local infrastructure.
D) To narrow the gap between the rich and the poor.
52. What do people tend to believe about the homeless?
A) They seldom meet the descriptions of homelessness.
B) They are the victims of fast economic development.
C) They are responsible for their own condition.
D) They account for the majority of drug addicts.
53. What is one of the causes for more and more people in Los Angeles to become homeless?
A) They find it increasingly difficult to afford a place to live.
B) The divorce rate in the county has been on a steady rise.
C) They have been compelled to take low-paying jobs.
D) The society fails to forgive them for their mistakes.
54. What do we learn from the new Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority report?
A) Supplying enough job opportunities for the homeless remains a challenge.
B) Everyone is pulling in the same direction to solve the homelessness problem.
　　C) The increase in new housing falls short of the demand of the growing homeless population.
D) Los Angeles’ homeless condition is deteriorating faster than many people predict.
55. How do most Los Angeles residents now feel about homelessness?
　　A) They are increasingly ashamed about its scale.
　　B) They find it no more scaring than it appears.
　　C) They are less and less indifferent to it.
　　D) They no longer find it shocking.

How Climate Change Will Affect What You Eat
A)Earlier this year,scientists warned that one in six animal species could go extinct (灭绝的) due to  climate  change.Could the  same  thing  happen to  our  crops  and  other  foodstuffs too?
B)It's clear that farmers in many parts of the world are going to find things harder in the
coming  decades.Last  week,BBC  Future  explored  one  scientist's  efforts   to  help  crops
cope  with  the  increased  probability  of  droughts.By  using  the  genes  from  resurrection (复活)plants,Jill Farrant of the University of Cape Town is exploring whether she can design crops to survive for much longer periods without water.
C)But  if  we  can't  find  ways  to  protect  other  foods,will  they  survive  climate  change? Fortunately,there  is  some  good  news   on  this  front.Despite  alarmist  headlines   about “foods  that  are  going  extinct,”there  is  no  evidence  that  major  food  types  like  beans, chocolate,wine,corn or wheat will cease to exist.
D)But  that   doesn't  mean   it's  all  good  news   for  future  food.We  will  probably  have  to 2023年12月英语四级真题第1套第4 页 共 9 页 by: 光速考研

change where we grow certain crops,as some regions get too hot.The disadvantage, obviously,is that local farmers will suffer under this situation.And some people may struggle to get the same access to certain foods.“Even if overall food production may be unaffected,food security can still be impacted,"says Margaret Walsh,a scientist at  the US Department of Agriculture's Climate Change Program Office.In other words, even if a certain food is still grown on some corner of the Earth,it doesn't mean that everyone will continue to have the same degree of access as today.
E)Overall,the yields of many foods,from staples to life-enhancing extras such as coffee and chocolate,will likely be impacted by climate change too.How those decreases will  be felt will depend on the degree of warming and the crop in question,but in general, “anything over about 30℃ is very bad for crops,”says Wolfram Schlenker,an associate professor  of  international  and  public  affairs  at  Columbia  University.For  example, statistical studies that he and a colleague built of corn and soybean(大豆)production in the U.S.show a steep decline after crossing the 30℃ temperature threshold (临界点).
F)In the U.S.—the world's largest producer of corn and soybeans—farms can move north to some degree,Schlenker says.But eventually,yields will likely suffer because the soil north  of lowa  declines  in  quality—a  legacy  of glacial( 冰 川 的 )expansion.Other   studies,including studies of wheat in India and corn in Africa,also found that there is a threshold above which yields sharply decline:crops can adapt and move,but only to a point.“What's common to all studies is the finding that extreme heat is damaging to crop growth,although  exact  cutoffs vary by  crop,"Schlenker  says."If predictions  for the end of the century are true,though,I think a lot of agricultural areas in the U.S.will see significant hits.”
G)Under current conditions,about 4%of the world's croplands experience drought in any given year,but by the end of the century those conditions are forecasted to jump to about 18%per   year.Some   studies   indicate   that   horticulture   crops—generally,everything besides  staples—may  be  impacted  most   severely,largely  because  they  tend  to  be confined to a  smaller  geographic area.Researcher Andrew Jarvis and his colleagues found that 80%of coffee-growing zones in Central America and Brazil could become unsuitable by 2050,for example,while climate change will likely have"great impacts" on cocoa (可可粉)production in West Africa.“High quality chocolate will be less available in the future,and if you want it,you'll have to pay a lot more for it,"Jarvis says.
H)This means that,for those who can afford it,some foods will simply cost them more in the future.But for poorer people,those same price jumps will likely cause certain foods to  go  extinct  from  their  diets.“The more you reduce,the  shorter  the  supply,and  the higher the price will jump,"Schlenker says.
I)   Another potential climate change-induced problem is our dependence on commodity crops—wheat,soybeans,corn and rice—which currently provide humanity with 75%of its calories,either directly or indirectly through the animals we raise on those crops. Jarvis and his colleagues also found that,over the past five decades,the world has seen  an increasing standardisation of diets;the foods we eat globally today are 36%more  similar than they were in  1961.While this can be good news for the world's poorest people who now consume more calories,protein and fat than in the past,homogeneity  (同一性)and over-dependence on a handful of staples leaves us vulnerable to threats  such as drought,disease and pests—all of which are predicted to worsen in many parts  of the world as a result of climate change.

J)There are ways we could soften the coming blow to the global food supply,however. Like Farrant's work with resurrection crops,a number of companies,organisations and researchers are aiming to create drought-and temperature-resistant crops through genetic engineering and conventional breeding.For now,the jury is still out as to how successful those endeavours will be."The people at Monsanto who I've talked to are much more optimistic that they'll be able to engineer heat-tolerant crops,"Schlenker says.“On the other hand,scientists at the USDA who I've spoken with are much more cautious."
K)Until  genetic  engineering  comes  to  fruition,other  strategies  might  also  help  in  some places,including    applying     more    fertiliser,implementing     better    irrigation,using machinery that gets crops out of the field faster or installing storage facilities to delay spoilage.“Many  places  could  benefit  a  great  deal  just  by  using  technologies  that already  exist,”Walsh  says.“General  farm  management  can  go  a  long  way  toward easing changes.”
L)Finally,diversifying our diet away from heat-sensitive wheat,corn,rice and other crops could  also  help.“We've  seen  profound  changes  in  the  last  decades  in  what  we  eat largely   as   a   result   of  international   trade,and   I   think  that   trend  toward  more diversification  will  continue,"Jarvis  says.“Depending  on  a  greater  number  of plant species creates a more vigorous and less risky food system—and one that provides a broader range of nutritional requirements.”

36.One consequence of climate change is that some people may not have adequate access to certain foods.
37.People around the world are eating foods more similar than what they used to eat.
38.A  recent  news  report  talked  about  scientific  efforts  to  help  crops  survive  droughts through genetic engineering.
39.It  is  predicted  that  climate  change  will  affect  the  availability  and  price  of  quality chocolate.
40.People wonder if certain crops and foodstufts could disappear like some animal species due to climate change.
41.Although farms in the U.S.can move a bit northward,crop yields may decrease.
42.One possible solution to the food security problem is diversification of diet.
43.It remains unsettled whether the global food supply problem can be solved by creating heat-tolerant crops through genetic engineering.
44.Poor people may have to give up eating certain foods because of their high prices.
45.A number of existing farming technologies could be used to reduce the negative effect
of climate change on food production.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre
Passage One

2023年12月英语四级真题第1套第6 页 共 9 页 by: 光速考研

Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　One of my bad habits is saying “busy"when people ask me how I'm doing.Sometimes it's because I actually am busy,but other times it's because that's what I think I'm supposed to  say.That's  what   important  people   say.That's  what  people  who   get  promoted   say.But  working  long  hours  doesn't  drive  better  results.Never  taking  a  vacation  won't  lead  to  a promotion.So why are we so proud to talk about how busy we are all the time?
　　　In  2016,researchers  from  Columbia,Harvard,and  Georgetown  conducted  a  study  to figure  it  out.They  found  busy  people  are  perceived  to  be  of high  status,and  interestingly,  these  status attributions are heavily influenced by our own beliefs about  social mobility.In other words,the  more  we  believe  that  one  has  the  opportunity  for  success  based  on  hard  work,the more we tend to think that people who skip leisure and work all the time are of higher  standing.
　　　That's why we  feel  like we have to  appear busy,and  there's  a real perception that  if someone  is  knee-deep  in  meetings,emails,and  stress,then  they're  probably  a  big  deal.This culture of busyness is making it hard  for employees to find work-life balance.According to a recent study,one in five highly engaged employees are at risk of burnout (精疲力竭).
　　　Personally,I'm  going  to  stop  saying  “busy”when  people  ask  me  how  I  am.It  sounds selfrighteous(自以为是的)and sets the wrong tone.Phrases like “I have limited access to email”and“T'll  respond  as  soon  as  I  get  back”sound  like  you're  being  held  against  your will from working as opposed to making the most of your time off.
　　　That's why we recently  launched  the  Out  of  Office  Email  Generator,a  free  tool  you can  use  before  your  next  long  weekend  or  trip.You  can  share  loud  and  proud  that  you won't  be  checking  email  until  you're  back.Managers  need  to  think  twice  about  emailing their teams on the weekend and talking about how busy they are.Leaders should take time off themselves and encourage employees to do the same.
46.What is a reason for the author to be in the habit of saying “busy”when asked how he is doing?
A)He just  follows  successful  people's  example.
B)He is actually proud to be fully occupied.
C)He thinks everyone should be devoted to work.
D)He  believes  busyness  ensures  accomplishments.
47.Why do we tend to think that busy people are of high status?
A)Our status can be attributed to our social mobility.
B)We hold the belief that hard work leads to success.
C)Our own opportunity for success never comes easily.
D)We find few people of high status have time for leisure.
48.What do we learn about the culture of busyness from a recent study?
A)It places  employees  in  endless meetings,emails  and  stress.
B)It compels  some  20%of employees to  appear  always busy.
C)It distorts many employees'belief of what a satisfying life is.
D)It  does much harm to many busy  employees'well-being.
49.What do such utterances as “I have limited access to email”sound like according to the author?
A)One is too busy to check all emails in time.
2023年12月英语四级真题第1套第7 页 共 9 页 by: 光速考研

B)One is opposed to the prevailing work culture.
C)One is forced by circumstances to stop working.
D)One is simply enjoying their time off work.
50.Why did the author and his colleagues launch the Out of Office Email Generator?
A)To enable busy employees to spend less time checking emails.
B)To ensure employees as well as employers truly have time off.
C)To stop managers from talking about how busy their teams usually are.
D)To encourage both employers and employees to answer emails promptly.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　Female employees consistently pay lower airfares than men do for the same flights because they tend to book earlier.
　　　We compared the airfare paid by employees in the same position within a company for the same class of travel and used a common statistical technique to account for other factors that might affect differences in airfares.We found that women paid on average $18 less per ticket than  their male  colleagues.Further  investigation  allowed  us  to  conclude that this gap is largely explained by the fact that women tended to book earlier than men, 1.8 days on average
　　　We wanted to determine what was causing these gender differences in booking business trips so we tested a variety of possible explanations,such as women choosing to plan ahead or male frequent travelers being inclined to book late.None of these explained away the gender gap,so we applied data collected from surveys that express consumer preferences that play a central role in economic decisions,such as patience and risk avoidance.
　　　We found that only the concept of "negative reciprocity"—in which an employee who feels  unfairly  treated  engages  in  negative  behaviors,such  as  spending  their  company's money less carefully—explains these differences.The surveys showed men tend to exhibit more of these negative behaviors than women.This isn't to say that all men engage in these behaviors—or that booking relatively late is a sign of abnormal behavior.It only means that the gender gap disappears when we plug in the negative reciprocity variable.
　　　Prior research on negative reciprocity among workers found that it can result in lower employee motivation,business performance and workplace morale(士气)and culture.
　　　Our results show another way these negative behaviors can manifest themselves,like in airline bookings,and add to evidence that women are less likely to engage in them.
　　　Companies  spend  significant  sums  of  money  on  business  travel.While  that   $18 difference per ticket may seem small,it adds up.Our analysis suggests early booking by women can translate into savings of S1 million a year for a large multinational company with 20,000 regular travelers.
51.What did the author's team conclude about the gender difference in airfares from their further investigation?
A)It is largely attributed to women booking earlier than men.
B)It is largely explained by women's choosing cheaper flights.
C)It is mainly accounted for by male employees'readiness to pay more.
D)It is due to the fact that women care more about their company's money.

A)What made male frequent travelers book air tickets late.
B)What caused women to plan ahead in booking business trips.
C)What motivated women to book cheaper flights.
D)What accounted for the gender gap in airfares.
53.What happened when the negative reciprocity variable was taken into account? A)Both men and women were found to engage in negative behaviors.
B)Neither men nor women viewed booking late as a bad behavior.
C)The gender difference in airfare expenses no longer existed.
D)The gender gap tended to narrow to a significant degree.
54.What did prior research on negative reciprocity among workers find?
A)It can do more harm to the workplace than to employees.
B)It contributes to the male-female divide in the workplace.
C)It proves to be counterproductive in a number of ways.
D)It  can result  in  increasing  labor-management  conflicts.
55.What does the author emphasize about their analysis in the last paragraph? A)It can help companies increase their savings significantly.
B)It  can  duly  contribute  to  companies'business  performance.
C)It can translate women's booking practice into men's behavior.
D)It  can  enhance  large  multinational  companies'competitiveness.

Questions 26 to 35 are based on the following passage.
　　　A  number   of  studies  have   looked  at  how   family   life  can  affect  productivity   and satisfaction   in   the    workplace.However,there   has    been     26    little  research  on  the influence  of  leisure  activities.So  Ciara  Kelly   and  colleagues  recruited   129  hobbyists  to  look at how the time spent on their hobbies     27   their  work  life.
　　　The  researchers  found  that  when  participants  spent  longer  than      28    on  their leisure  activity,their  belief  in  their  ability  to  perform  their  job  was  strengthened.But  this was only the    29   _when they had  a  serious  hobby  that was  dissimilar to  their job,or when their hobby was similar to their work but they only did it    30  .When  their  hobby was both serious and similar to their job,then spending more time on it actually decreased  their work    31   _.
　　　Why  might  that  be?To  maintain   a   serious  hobby,people  need  to   invest  significant psychological resources,say the authors—so if the activity has the  same kinds of demands as  their work,they  may  be  left 32     and  unable  to  perform  well  at their job.But if their hobby is quite different from their career,it may not      33 in the same way but instead help them develop other knowledge and skills that can    34   their  confidence  at  work. “Consider  a  scientist  who  is  a  keen  rock  climber,”says  Kelly.“Since  climbing  is  so  far 35     from  their  day-to-day  work  activities,they  can  still  recover  from  the  demands  of their job with plenty of resources."

C)casually	K)relative
D)efficiency	L)removed

Each statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs.Identify  the paragraph from  which  the  information  is  derived.You  may  choose  a  paragraph  more  than  once. Each paragraph is marked with a letter:Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
More fathers are taking paternity leave,but mothers are still doing all the work
A)Attitudes  towards  paternity  leave(陪产假)have drastically changed in America in the last  five  years  as  more  fathers  feel  comfortable  taking  extended  time  off,but  gender bias persists when it comes to career prospects and the home,according to a new study of working parents.
B)Research   by   the   Boston   College   Center   for   Work   &Family,which    surveyed   new parents  at  four  large  US  companies  who  were  qualified  for  taking  at  least  six  weeks paid parental leave,found that  81%of the  1,240  employees  surveyed  said  the  notion of
2023年12月英语四级真题第2套第4 页共9页 by: 光速考研

fathers taking leave has become more acceptable.
C)Of those surveyed,62%of fathers took the maximum amount of time off compared to 93%of mothers,and around three-quarters of workers said their employer was equally supportive of mothers and fathers taking parental leave and over half said leave policies had made workplace culture better.
D)The US is one of only three countries in the world not to offer statutory(法定的)paid leave,but increasingly  states and companies are  starting to take up the issue.So far, eight states and the District of Columbia have their own paid family leave laws.
E)Brad  Harrington,executive  director  of  the   center   and   lead   author   of  the   study, estimates only 20%to 30%of companies in the US offer paid parental leave.He feels the research findings reflect an obvious change in corporate attitudes to new fathers taking time off
F)“We did a study on paternity leave five years ago.Compared with those findings,these numbers were shocking to me.I did not expect 80%of people to say the organisation finds dads taking this leave acceptable and three-quarters to say it's equally supportive of women and men taking leave,"Harrington said.
G)The previous study found that nearly three-quarters of fathers saw two to four weeks as an appropriate duration for paternity leave and 76%said they would prefer not to take all their time offat once.
H)Since  then,there  have  been  a  number  of  legal  cases  against  companies  involving paternity leave—including cases against JPMorgan Chase and Estee Lauder—which have helped put pressure on companies to make their parental leave policies gender neutral.
I)   However,the study also shows how traditional gender roles endure both at work,where more  women  than  men  reported  changes  in  their  perceived  career  potential,and  at home—even among workers who claim to have a strong desire for equality.
J)The vast majority of men,97%,said one of the top reasons to take leave was to share caregiving with their partner.But when they were  asked  about  how  caregiving  and household  tasks were  divided,their  answers  painted  a  different  picture.While  about 75%of employees said both genders should give the same amount of care,the majority of men and nearly half of women admitted that in reality the female actually did most of it.A tiny fraction,2%,of men said they did more of the childcare.
K)Men and women's experiences of the return to work following parental leave were also  considerably different.Of the women  surveyed,32%reported  a downturn in their job  satisfaction,while   14%said   it  increased.In  comparison,17%of  men   said   their  job  satisfaction went down and 20%said it went up.Meanwhile,more women reported an  increase in their responsibilities and manager expectations after childbirth.Half of the  women said they used flexible work arrangements after becoming a parent,while just  27%of men did.Similar percentages of men and women said they enjoyed their careers  and that it gave them a sense of achievement,while around half of women and 44%of men said it was a key part of their identity.
L)On the subject of career advancement,59%of women and 49%of men said leave could be limiting and both genders said they feared it would have an impact on their progress long-term.But on opportunity for promotion,more than double the number of women, 30%compared with  15%of men,believed their chances to be lower after becoming a

parent.Despite progress,the struggle for women to reach the highest positions of power is demonstrated in this year's Fortune 500 list,which featured a record 33 female CEOs, but this still represents a tiny fraction of the total.
M)Harrington said culture change depends on companies putting more focus on men and their responsibilities.“By that I mean companies need to give men paternity leave and encourage men to take time off to be with their kids early on in the kids'life.They also  need  to  recognise  that  men  have  to  make  significant  adjustments  when  they become   parents.Companies    cannot   do    all   these    things   to    enhance    women's advancement and then turn around and say,'Oh,but we don't expect the men to take over for the women at home.?”
N)In   May,the   American    Civil   Liberties    Union(ACLU)and   Outten    &Golden   LLP announced a historic class-action$5m settlement with JPMorgan Chase on behalf of male employees who claim they were illegally denied access to paid parental leave. Derek Rotondo,35,filed the discrimination charge against his company after he was allegedly told by his HR department that mothers were considered primary caregivers. Thus,they  were  allowed  to  take   16  weeks  of  paid  parental  leave.Fathers,however, could take just two weeks.
O)The father of two from Columbus,Ohio,who still works at the company as an associate  and  investigator,said  he   has  witnessed   a“domino  effect(多米诺效应)”across  companies since the settlement,but that there is still substantial progress to be made towards changing attitudes towards paternity leave.
P)“I do think there's still some way to go…there's still going to be sort of the unstated expectation  for  new  dads  to  essentially  come  right  back  to  work,but  I  think  the research  is  showing  that's  starting  to  change.”He  said  equal  parental  leave  is  an  essential component to creating gender equality in the workplace.“The old standard of women staying home,having babies and cooking doesn't apply and hasn't applied for a long time.”

36.In  the  absence  of  Federal   legislation,some   states   in  the  US  have  passed  laws concerning paid family leave.
37.Most fathers admitted that even during their paternity leave they actually did much less childcare than the mother.
38.According  to  one  father,equal  parental  leave  is  indispensable  to  achieving  gender equality in the workplace.
39.One survey indicated there is now less objection to paternity leave.
40.Compared to five years ago,according to one researcher,many more people said their organisation gave the same support to men and women taking parental leave.
41.One  study  finds  that  even  workers  who  claim  to  desire  gender  equality   stick  to traditional gender roles both at work and at home.
42.The majority of workers surveyed said parental leave policies had improved workplace culture.
43.In spite of progress,the number of women  in top positions of big companies remains extremely small.

44.According to one estimate,less than one third of companies in the US provide paid parental leave.
45.A number of lawsuits have pressured companies to formulate gender neutral policies on parental leave.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　Having a rival can keep you committed to achieving your goals and enhance your overall performance.But before you  go  out  and  find  an  entrepreneur  to  outcompete,it's important  to  understand   and   avoid  the  traps  that   often   come  with  rivalry.After   all, competitive rivalry can also hinder effective decision-making and increase your willingness to take risks,behaviors that can ultimately hurt your venture's success.
　　　Finding  someone  you're  committed  to  outcompeting  can  be  a  great  way  to  stay  focused on your goals and push your venture to the next level.But when you're intently  focused  on  outperforming  your  rivals,you  may  begin  to  develop  a“win-at-all-costs” mentality that causes you to ignore how you achieve success.One group of researchers,  for example,examined the link between rivalry  and unethical behavior.They  found that  when people compete against their rivals,they are more willing to behave unethically to  win.But  such  behavior  may  stain  your  reputation  and  strain  relationships  important  to  your success.One way to avoid this trap is to stop and reflect on what's important.While outperforming your rivals may provide short-term benefits,the loss of your integrity will  have long-term consequences.
　　　One reason having a rival can enhance your venture's performance is that it creates a level of excitement that drives you to work harder.But this eagerness to win may also hurt your venture's success,particularly when it causes you to make impulsive,insensible decisions.But it's possible to avoid such costly mistakes by making a habit of engaging in critical  thinking,such  as  considering  opposing  viewpoints  and  conducting  cost-benefit analyses,especially for those decisions that are complex and can determine the future of your venture.
　　　The sense of eagerness that comes with having a rival can not only cause you to make poorer decisions,but it can also lead you to take greater risks that put your venture in peril. One way you can overcome the risk-inducing effects of rivalry that stand to endanger your venture's success is to remain attentive to your emotional state and actively monitor how such feelings are affecting your decision-making.

46.How can competitive rivalry benefit entrepreneurs according to the passage?
A)By enabling them to outcompete other entrepreneurs.
B)By enabling them to make their venture a success.
C)By helping them to reach long-term goals.
D)By helping them to stay goal-oriented.

B)Prioritize reaping immediate benefits.
C)Estimate the long-term consequences.

B)By taking steps that stand to endanger their rivals’success.
C)By monitoring how their decision-making impacts their mentality.    D)By keeping their emotions in check to avoid making poor decisions.
Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　A multitasker is one who can perform two or more tasks effectively at the same time,  which-apart from the obvious differences—is similar to what a computer does.The concept does indeed come from the realms of technology,where it is used to refer to an operating system that can  execute multiple tasks  at the  same time.However,the  question  is:can  a person really be a multitasker?
　　　For  most  scientists,the  answer  is  no.So  much  so  that,according  to  experts  in neuroscience (神经系统科学),our brains do not handle multitasking situations well.As soon  as  two  tasks  require  our  attention,productivity  suffers.What  we  call  multitasking, therefore,is in reality the ability to move more or less quickly from one task to another.  This requires two  essential  conditions:that  one  of the  tasks  needs  to  be  automatic,like walking or eating,and that they both need different mental processes.Answering the phone and writing at the same time,for example.
　　　However,on the other side of the coin there are people who maintain that it is possible to  be,or  at  least  seem  to  be,multitasking.A  recent  study  concluded  that  regardless  of whether people are actually handling several tasks or not,the mere fact that they perceive this activity as multitasking has a positive effect on their performance.
　　　The business perspective  offers  a  different  view:multitasking  is  understood  as  the ability to adapt to all types of environment within a company and effectively undertake different activities within a set time frame.Indeed,many companies look for people who are skilled in multitasking to improve their productivity.From this different perspective, you can not only be multitasking but this ability can also be taught:something that is easier in fluid organisations,which favour flexibility in their working practices.
2023年12月英语四级真题第2套第8 页 共 9 页 by:  光速考研

　　　The benefits  of multitasking  are  clear.Being  quicker  and more  efficient increases  our performance  and  the  number  of  tasks  completed.But  having  to  pay  attention  to  several things  at  once  means  that  the  powers  of  concentration  are  reduced  and  that  can  lead  to more  mistakes.
51.What  does  a“multitasker”originally  refer  to?
A)An operating system capable of doing several tasks at once.
B)A skilled worker executing more than one task at the same time.
C)A sophisticated technology doing several tasks effectively at once.   D)An efficient person able to perform multiple tasks at the same time.
52.Why can't people really be multitaskers according to neuroscientists?
A)They are not sufficiently exposed to multitasking situations.
B)They are not comparable to mechanical operating systems.
C)Their brains do not allow them to multitask.
D)Their  attention  span  cannot  be  expanded.
53.What do we learn from the conclusion of a recent study on multitasking?
A)People make greater achievements by maintaining whatever they are doing is multitasking.  B)People's performance benefits from the perception of what they are doing as multitasking.
C)People's active mental processes exert a positive effect on their multitasking. D)People can improve their capabilities by handling multitasking  situations.
54.How does the business world view multitasking?
A)It is a rare skill often found in fluid organisations.
B)It is an adaptable capability required of all workers.
C)It is an essential quality many employees lack.
D)It is a desirable ability that can be developed.
55.What does the author imply we should do if we have to focus on some task and do it well?
A)Work in a flexible way.                                     C)Avoid   multitasking.
B)Learn  from  mistakes.                                          D)Increase   efficiency.

Section A
　　　When people set out to improve their health,they usually take a familiar path:starting a healthy diet,getting better sleep,and doing regular exercise.Each of these behaviors is  important,of course,but they all     26   on physical health—and a growing body of research suggests that social health is just as,if not more,important to -   27   well-being.
　　　One   recent   study   published   in   the   journal   PLOS   ONE,for   example,found   that   the strength  of  a  person's  social  circle  was  a  better      28  _of    self-reported    stress,happiness and  well-being   levels  than   fitness   tracker   data   on   physical   activity,heart  rate   and   sleep. That finding  suggests that the “ .     29self”represented  by   endless   amounts   of  health   data doesn't  tell  the  whole     30  _.
　　　There's also a qualified self,which is who I am,what are my activities,my social network,and all of these aspects are not     31   in any of these measurements.
　　　This idea is supported by plenty of     32 research.Studies have shown that social support—whether it comes from friends,family members or a spouse—is    33   associated with better mental and physical health.A rich social life,these studies suggest,can lower stress levels,improve mood,encourage positive health behaviors and discourage damaging ones,boost heart health and improve illness     34   rates.
　　　Social isolation,meanwhile,is linked to higher rates of physical diseases and mental health conditions.It's a significant problem,     35   since loneliness is emerging as a  widespread public health problem in many countries.

Answer Sheet 2.
Teenagers and social networking
A)As  a  parent  of  two  boys  at  primary  school,I  worry  about  the  issues  associated  with  teenagers  and  social  media.Newspapers  are  constantly  filled  with  frightening  accounts  of drug  addiction  and  aggressive  behaviour  supposedly  caused  by  violent  videogames. But  even  when  these  accounts  touch  on  real  concerns,they  do  not  really  reflect  the  great mass  of everyday teenage  social  behaviour:the  online  chat,the  texting,the  surfing, and the emergence of a new teenage sphere that is conducted digitally.
B)New  technologies  always  provoke  generational  panic,which  usually  has  more  to  do with adult fears than with the lives of teenagers.In the  1930s,parents worried that radio was  gaining"an  irresistible  hold  of their  children".In  the  80s,the  great  danger  was  the Sony  Walkman(随身听).When  you  look  at  today's  digital  activity,the  facts  are  much more positive than you might expect.
C)Indeed,social scientists who study young people have found that their digital use can be inventive and even beneficial.This is true not just in terms of their  social lives,but their education too.So if you use a ton of social media,do you become unable,or unwilling, to  engage  in  face-to-face  contact?The  evidence   suggests  not.Research  by  Amanda Lenhart  of  the  Pew  Research  Centre,a  US  think  tank,found  that  the  most  passionate texters are also the kids most likely to spend time with friends in person.One form of socialising doesn't replace the other.It expands it.
D)“Kids  still  spend  time  face  to  face,”Lenhart  says.Indeed,as  they  get  older  and  are given more  freedom,they often  ease up  on  social networking.Early  on,the web  is their “third  space",but  by  the   late  teens,it's  replaced   in  reaction  to   greater  independence. They have to be  on  Facebook,to know what's  going  on  among  friends  and  family,but they  are  ambivalent(有矛盾心理的)about  it,says  Rebecca  Eynon,a  research  fellow  at the  Oxford  Internet  Institute,who  has  interviewed  about  200  British  teenagers  over three  years.As  they  gain   experience  with  living   online,they  begin  to   adjust  their behaviour,struggling with new communication skills,as they do in the real world.
E)Parents  are  wrong  to  worry  that  kids  don't  care  about  privacy.In  fact,they  spend  hours changing  Facebook  settings  or  using  quick-delete  sharing  tools,such  as  Snapchat,to minimise   their   traces.Or    they   post    a   photograph    on   Instagram,have    a   pleasant conversation with friends and then delete it so that no traces remain.
F)This  is  not  to  say  that  kids  always  use  good  judgment.Like  everyone  else,they  make mistakes—sometimes  serious  ones.But  working  out  how  to  behave   online  is   a  new social  skill.While there's plenty of drama and messiness online,it is not,for most teens, a  cycle   of  non-stop  abuse:a  Pew   study  found  only   15%of  teens  said  someone  had bullied them online in the last 12 months.
G)But   surely   all  this   short-form   writing   is   affecting   literacy?Certainly,teachers  worry. They say that kids use overly casual language and text-speak in writing,and don't have as  much  patience   for  long  reading   and  complex   arguments.Yet  studies  of  first-year college papers  suggest these anxieties may be partly based on misguided nostalgia( 怀

旧).When Stanford University scholar Andrea Lunsford gathered data on the rates of errors in “freshman composition”papers going back to 1917,she found that they were virtually identical to today.
H)But  even  as  error  rates   stayed  stable,student  essays  have  blossomed   in   size  and complexity.They are now six times longer and,unlike older “what I did this summer” essays,they  offer  arguments   supported  by  evidence.Why?Computers  have  vastly increased the ability of students to gather information,sample different points of view and write more fluidly.
I)   When linguist Naomi Baron  studied students'instant messaging even there she found  surprisingly rare usage of short forms such as“u”for“you”,and as students got older, they began to write in more grammatical sentences.That is because they want to appear more  adult,and  they  know  how  adults  are  expected  to  write.Clearly,teaching  teens formal writing is still crucial,but texting probably isn't destroying their ability to learn it.
J)It is probably true that fewer kids are heavy readers compared with two generations ago, when  cheap paperbacks boosted rates  of reading.But  even  back  then,a minority  of people—perhaps  20%—were   lifelong  heavy  readers,and   it  was   cable  TV,not  the internet,that struck a blow at that culture in the  1980s.Still,15%or more  of kids  are found   to   be   deeply   bookish.In    fact,the   online   world    offers   kids   remarkable opportunities to become literate and creative because young people can now publish ideas not just to their friends,but to the world.And it turns out that when they write for strangers,their sense of“authentic audience”makes them work harder,push themselves further,and create powerful new communicative forms.
K)Few would deny that too much time online can be harmful.Some of the dangers are emotional:hurting someone from a distance is not the same as hurting them face to face.If we're lucky,the legal environment will change to make teenagers'online lives less  likely  to  haunt  them  later  on.Just  last  week,California  passed  a  law  allowing minors to demand that internet firms erase their digital past and the EU has considered similar legislation.
L)Distraction is also a serious issue.When kids switch from chat to music to homework, they are indeed likely to have trouble doing each task well.And studies show that pupils don't fact-check information online—“smart searching"is a skill schools need to teach urgently.It's also true that too much social networking and game playing can cut into schoolwork and sleep.This is precisely why parents still need to set firm boundaries around it,as with any other distraction.
M)So what's the best way to cope?The same boring old advice that applies to everything in parenting:moderation.Rebecca Eynon argues that it's key to model good behaviour. Parents who stare non-stop at their phones and don't read books are likely to breed kids who will do the same.As ever,we ought to be careful about our own behaviour.

36.Research has  found  the  use  of digital  technology  benefits  not  only  teenagers'social lives but also their studies.
37.It is urgent that schools teach kids how to verify online information.
38.Students now write longer and more complex essays than their counterparts in previous decades while the error rates remain unchanged.
39.Newspaper reports of teenagers give a false picture of their behaviour.

40.Parents are advised to mind their own digital behaviour and set a good example for their kids.
41.Contrary to parents'belief,kids try hard to leave as few traces as possible on the web.
42.Students'ability to learn formal writing is unlikely to be affected by texting.
43.Historically,new technologies have always caused great fears among parents.
44.The reading culture was seriously affected by cable television some four decades ago.
45.Teachers  say  that  kids’writing  is  too  casual,using  language  characteristic  of  text
messages.

Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section.Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements.For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 46 to 50 are based on the following passage.
　　　In the history of horse racing,few horses have captured the affection of the  British public  like  Red  Rum.Today,three  decades   after  his  retirement,he  is   still  one   of  the best-known and most beloved racehorses of all time.
　　　Red Rum was passed around to several owners before being purchased for Noel Le Mar.The  agent  who  made  the  purchase  was  the  now-legendary  horse  trainer  Donald “Ginger”McCain.
　　　It wasn't apparent at the time,but Red Rum had a serious bone disease in his foot.For many horses (and many trainers)this would mean the end of a racing career before it even
began.For Ginger and Red Rum,though,it was just an obstacle to greatness that had to be
overcome.
　　　Red Rum's true talent came out in steeplechases(障碍赛马).His power,speed  and  jumping ability carried him to his first Grand National title in  1973.The very next year, Red Rum returned to take his second title.He was the first horse to take successive firsts  since Reynoldstown in 1935-1936.Red Rum's spirit and grace had already begun to charm  the leagues of Grand National fans.
　　　In the following two years,Red Rum lost out on the title,coming in second both times. When he returned in 1977 to try again,he was largely regarded as past his prime.He was  12 years old and not expected to place highly.He surprised sporting fans around the world  when he came in a remarkable 25 lengths ahead of the nearest horse,taking his third Grand  National win.To this day,Red Rum's third win is known as one of the greatest moments in  horse racing history
　　　Red Rum was headed for the Grand National once again in 1978 but suffered an injury in one of his heels shortly before the race.He was retired soon after,but his public life and fame by no means decreased with the end of his career.Red Rum traveled all over the country for various engagements.He often led pre-race parades at Aintree Racecourse and was a popular guest at charity benefits and public events.

Passage Two
Questions 51 to 55 are based on the following passage.
　　　People  in  business  often  make  decisions  based  on  their  own  personal  feelings  or instincts.It is quite horrifying to see people being guided by some unknown force.But how wise is it,really,to let your instincts drive your decisions?
　　　In the decision-making process,relying on instincts only makes sense when you have a vast experience to support you.Simply "feeling"that something is right or should be done is highly subjective and can drown you.
　　　On the other hand,there is a more rational approach to making decisions.Data and analysis have long been associated with informed decisions.These reduce the likelihood of errors and increase the chances of success.Big,systematic data is mostly the foundation of most of our decisions,personal and business alike.But with its extreme usability comes a complication:what do you do if you strongly feel something should not be done,even if the data insists that it should?
　　　This seemingly easy question is what drives the need to understand the relationship between   instincts   and   data   in  the   decision-making  process.Without  making  things complicated,the solution to this dilemma is using data and instincts in conjunction to arrive at the best possible decisions.
Instinctive decisions are always backed by previous experiences or information,which
2023年12月英语四级真题第3套第5页共6 页 by:  光速考研

acknowledges  that  instinctive  decisions  have  worked  in  the  past.Decisions  are  not  about making  the  choice  and  braving  the  consequences  because  you  want  to  blindly  trust  your instincts.They  are  about  combining  your  inner  wisdom  with  the  knowledge  of  systematic data to make the best decisions.
　　　Sometimes,rational   analysis   and   data   are   impractical   to   be   employed   in   certain situations.Absence   of   definitive    criteria,and   time    and   resource    constraints,and   novel situations  are  instances  which  limit  the  practicality  of  data.The  only  feasible  option  is  to rely   on  what  your   instincts   tell  you.In  these   situations,instincts   can   help   you   make effective and quick decisions.
　　　Combining   instinctive   and   rational    analysis    produces   well-rounded    decisions.It reduces the  chances  of making  mistakes,and  has  increasingly  become  a  favorite  approach to decision-making among leaders of today.
51.What does the author say businesspeople often do?
A)Strive to make sense of some unknown forces.
B)Avoid being driven by their own feelings.
C)Draw on a vast wealth of past  experience.
D)Rely  on  instincts  in  decision-making.
52.What should we take into account in order to make informed decisions?


A)The  likelihood  of errors.
B)Systematic  data  and  analysis.


C)The  complexity  of  circumstances.
D)Personal  feelings  and  business  strategies.

53.What should people do in a decision-making process if instincts disagree with data?
A)Resolve  the  dilemma  with  previous  experience.
B)Figure out which of the two is more reliable.
